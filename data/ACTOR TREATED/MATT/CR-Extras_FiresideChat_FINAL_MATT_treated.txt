oh hi i didn't see you there i'm hanging out this afternoon apparently reading some fantastic books and excited to hang out with a lot of you fun interesting elements on the internet but i figure let's go ahead and make it comfortable let's enjoy ourselves a little bit of personal time together and get to know a little bit about each other i've got some fine port here to keep me company like you do on a tuesday afternoon at 400pm i poured a lot in there so this is what's called not being the designated driver anyway i'm glad you could join me we're going to have a good time hopefully this is going to be a general hang out get to know each other type circumstance as far as the types of questions the quality of questions they can be game related they can be critical role related they can be role-playing game related they can be voice-over industry related they can be just life related they can be stuff about my history or telling me about your history just opening conversations about that i want this to be an open hangout a whatever you're curious about and then i might ask some curious things back so yeah this is just a hangout thank you for the robe recommendation this is the finest quality i could find for $20 on amazon and it met my expectations it is every bit as shitty as i expected but anyway welcome we'll get a ways into this q&a and then maybe we'll start creating an npc and a monster for the campaign a little ways down the road so cheers oh that is nice that is sweet anyway glad you could join us this will be interesting let's begin with some fun questions here if i can remember how to get the pad here open possibly maybe we'll find out if i learn technology if you've seen the periscopes you know that me and technology strangely do not mix very well but that's okay first question i see in there is where's larkin that's a better question for liam o'brien larkin resides in the same location that raishan does which is as far as everyone knows very deceased by the way for the record if you're not caught up on critical role i'm going to try and avoid spoilers but something may squeeze through and i apologize in advance did i fix the yard fix is a relative term i got the yard mowed and then the remnants of the mowing could fill eight or nine of our green bins so we've been slowly off-loading it week after week and our yard in the meantime looks like a series of hills it's terrifying but we are getting it taken care of hopefully let's see what questions we've got here it is a founders reserve porto sandeman it looks like it has darkman on the cover i know people say zorro i'm going to go darkman because that's the person i am if you haven't seen darkman it's awesome the first one don't see the rest of them leslie nielsen actually the first thing i really knew him from we'll get to the first question at the top what's your favorite trope in d&d or just in general what was your favorite storyline besides the chroma conclave this is from nikosia good question favorite trope in d&d those are fantasy tropes in general and i personally really like political intrigue the fight-the-monsters is fun but i like the idea of trying to balance that with nations that are warring or crumbling there hasn't been a lot of that in this campaign because i can't fit every theme and every trope in every campaign but i wouldn't be surprised if those elements show up in campaigns down the road personally i really enjoy challenges that involve more finesse besides just bursting into doors and defeating creatures so that's a big fan of mine as far as previous campaigns that i really enjoyed i ran the expedition at castle ravenloft and that was an absolute blast i adored that campaign as i ran it so that one has a special place in my heart and had some political intrigue which was fun what's another fun question what's my favorite class in d&d by lairohi which i'm probably butchering that my apologies seriously i'm really sorry about that i've always loved casters caster classes were a big thing for me growing up i love the options of spellcasting and the utility factor for a party you may not be the most powerful or the most survivable except the later levels get powerful it is nice to be able to take care of some of those challenges the rest of the party is like i don't know what to do we're kind of fucked and you're like wait i got a spell for that you're essentially the clippy paperclip of d&d and i love that that was a lot of fun that chatroom is moving really fast we're cultivating questions from the chat so don't worry even if it goes past we're keeping an eye out has the raishan trophy mount arrived yet it has arrived we haven't opened it yet we're planning another critmas scheduling has been a pain in the butt between completing the campaign guide general work and multiple projects at once and everyone else's busy schedules organizing another day to do a critmas has been very arduous endeavor but we're zeroing down on it soon we will have that soon and then we'll have all of them and we might actually be adding them to the set over here pretty soon as one once again you guys are amazing thank you again how surprised was i when liam killed everyone mid-last week from critternation3000 (laughs) definitely surprised i wasn't expecting him to just throw out you know the abyss against a bunch of level one us-es that early in i had an inkling he was going to do one of those you wake up and you're still okay in another realm or you're out of your sleep circumstance but the party was like it would also be fitting if he literally brought me in to be a player for the first time in a long time in his game and he fucking throws a demogorgon at me and kills me in one hit and that's it and thanks matt for playing because as much as that sucks on one degree that shit would be funny that would be so funny i'm going to adjust this real fast because it's turning off rather quickly on me if i can find it because i don't know where it's all organized where is the settings on this son of a-- there it is i see it pardon me internet i appreciate your patience we're going to head down to the control center general display auto-lock in 15 minutes that'll work fine thank you pardon me for the slight delay there friends i appreciate your patience if i could pull it up to where i was there we go thank you i'm going to have another sip of port because it's that kind of day glad you can come and join me matt did you know that is not a real fireplace behind you from pskinner [off-screen] (laughter) it's a tv taliesin jaffe you have pretty eyes he does have really pretty eyes he has really pretty eyes (clicks tongue) that got weirdor did it the baker's interest in vox machina all right well grog has been put in a bunch so there's an interest in grog i can expand upon that if that should win so we have grog as one option people here are throwing out wedding so i'll put that in there vengeance vengeance is always a fun one and a nice change up from the previous suggestions you've given this is a lot here i know this is a rough process guys we're all figuring this out as we go but we're trying the best we can we're getting a lot of repeating ones that we've already said okay fanboy i've seen come up quite a few times we'll go with that and the last one will be bring tary home that's interesting we got-- what was it again grog wedding vengeance fanboy bring tary home those are the five choices we're going to throw those up in the chat on the straw poll take a minute or two to get your votes in we'll see which one of those comes out on top this is a very interesting process (evil laugh) people saying mic is low i don't know if that's the case or it was just their screen but if it's just your computer too bad turn up your volume next question pineapples on pizza yea or nay eh i made a third option i've had it and it's all right not my preference i wouldn't go out of my way to order pineapples on pizza but if pineapples show up on pizza it's the only pizza there i'm not going to be like i will not eat you i'll go all right and i'll eat it i'm in between not meant to be a cop out literally that is my answer i hope that was helpful that was from kidcross by the way thank you kid rossreynolds asks how do you balance your major part in critical role and your career as a voice actor i'm still figuring it out oh thank you ryan wondrous oh look at this delivery system it's glorious the robe made me gilmore suddenly i don't know why i'm going to have some more of that port this isn't a bad way to spend a tuesday afternoon with you guys thanks for chilling with me this is good how do i balance critical role with being a voice actor i don't know yet i'm still working on it when you live a career for long enough that could end tomorrow and you don't know where you're next paycheck is coming from and it's a passion you end up doing odd jobs to make rent doing temp work doing data entry environmental agencies or stocking warehouses you learn to say yes to everything it's the idea that whenever opportunity arises you seize it i feel very fortunate that in recent years because of all the hard work and because of shows like critical role that have had a lot of more opportunities arise i probably said yes to a lot of things i shouldn't have and in doing so it's consumed most of my free time and it's driving me a little crazy but i'm learning that balance both me and marisha are each other's support in both of our lives getting a little crazy and trying to make sure we allow time for self-care and spending time together and carving out time for the people that are closest to us part of the reason critical role is so important to us it isn't just the show but honestly it's a chance every week for us to get to hang out with some of our favorite people that we don't have the time to most of the other days of the week or month so it's still something i'm working on i have a lot of projects on my plate right now finishing the campaign guide's going to be a big weight off my chest we're in the final throes of it right now i'm really excited for you i hope you guys like it but i'm learning that process now i'm notoriously work myself to death i tend to take on too much and try to get it done and it's not the healthiest thing so i'm working on it so my answer is i don't know i'm still trying i'll let you know in a year if i figure out the secret otherwise i don't know pertlikethefruit asks is there some type of npc in particular you've been itching to introduce but the moment never presented itself yeah there's a few npcs that i've created that never had a chance to show up but i'm not going to tell you because any npc that doesn't get a chance-- and any dm or gm will tell you this-- an npc that you like that doesn't have the opportunity to shine or show up goes back in the toolbox for later so they'll come back eventually i'm sure they'll come back they'll come back trust me torchbaricane asks what's my favorite type of cookie that would be gingersnap gingersnaps are awesome because they're not loaded down with too much sweetness but it's got the right amount of cinnamon spice i like things that are sweet and spicy so gingersnaps are pretty great yeah i'll go with that let's go with the next npc choice since we got that locked in now we did a couple questions there this is so delightfully chaotic i apologize but thank you for sticking with me on this what is the answer bring tary home oh man this is going to be fun cool got that in there and the second to last thing i'm going to ask about this npc is they have a secret there's something that this npc is keeping a secret that may or may not unfold in the game we don't know but you'll know and i'll know but what is this npc's secret go ahead and introduce into the chat room what your ideas are keep them concise if you can we'll get that worked out so put it into the chat room and we'll pull some out as they go (laughs) okay they're a drow that's not a very good secret they're not keeping it very well unless they're an illusion i mean it's possible hmm hmm there's a lot of interesting here let's try-- okay he's a revenant that's an interesting one i'm trying to pick things that might work into the next campaign i don't want to pick anything that's going to wreck it or the storyline that i have worked out in my head so i'm having to cherry-pick a little bit for this one secretly a paladin that's interesting can play with that put ziggurat on there just ziggurat he's a hitman oh man this is so nuts oh that's interesting he's blind there we go some interesting ones there some fun little things that can be utilized some of these secrets you guys put on there might roll into other things that were already mentioned we'll see how that plays out so reading us back what do we have revenant secretly a paladin ziggurat-- what was the other ones hitman or he's blind okay so we're going to throw that up into the chat in a moment to get that straw poll going and we'll see which one of those wins out to be the npc's secret that'll be interesting blind is not exactly a secret you say however with the right magic you can keep it a secret i have ideas don't worry i can play with this jayredwine says how'd you get into burning man about 2008 or so i was in a bit of a rough patch losing my faith in humanity and the arts in a lot of ways i was in a rough period self-esteem personal stuff and my acting coach at the time who hilariously is taliesin's mom kether she had been going for many years she said you would enjoy this and you should go this would be a good thing for you and i was like i don't know i'm not into the whole hippie drug culture i had my thoughts of what the event was she's like it's not like that i mean it is like that in some ways but not really all right fine i'll go i made a lot of excuses she didn't let me adhere to them eventually went and it was a lot more than i expected it's certainly not for everybody it's a harsh environment it's a very open culture of all walks of life culture sexualities expressions a lot of people there just walk nude a lot of art hippie-dippie stuff that a lot of people probably couldn't even deal with or would hate entirely but for me it was a wonderful environment of adults at play for a week and i really enjoyed it it became a very important part of my life so i go every year it's my cleansing my reset button my creative need to return to the default world i've met a few critters out there who are burners as well they've come by operator is a nice guy if you're watching hello operator hopefully see you this year but it's definitely not for everybody it's hard to get there it's hard to survive out there it's a harsh desert made of high-alkali playa powder electronics die out there it's hot you have to bring everything in to survive and then bring it out but if you're ready to make the journey there and if you have that artistic mindset it can be a really cool experience anyway do we have an answer on that straw poll ziggurat okay then i think we have a pretty solid background on this npc and where they can come into play i'm excited about this prospect the last thing we need is a name you guys throw out some cool names i'll pick out things that reach me and we'll vote on which one we want the npc name to be so go ahead and throw your suggestions in the chatroom for the name of this drow baker (laugh) no nope nope i know you guys want to be funny and cute i want to try to make this also work within the story where it can be taken seriously because certain names will not be taken seriously if they're introduced in this game and troy is definitely one of them we'll start with ruberick that's interesting miklos m-i-k-l-o-s oh man there's a good one that passed by too fast zaloh man it went by too fast curse you chat for being active no you guys are doing great let's do k'ryyn k-apostrophe-r-y-y-n noxtra n-o-x-t-r-a is that four that's five all right so we'll go ahead and throw those into the straw poll and you guys go ahead and jump in there and vote on the name then from those names we'll pick those and from there we'll have an npc pretty much completed that you guys helped create that will be introduced probably in this next arc of the game so that'll be interesting i'm excited to see what comes out of this one (laugh) with that i'm going to go have another sip of my drink rip troy it's cute it was a really funny idea guys but in the interest of wanting to keep the narrative realistic and because troy's good friends with a lot of us that would have made it a little weird question from actiongordon bees yes or no if yes how many bees yes how many seven i think bees are awesome bees are great they're necessary we have a lot of bees in our backyard they're cute they land on me sometimes people get freaked out by bees that's fine i mean honey bees fuck hornets and yellow jackets i hate them but bees are cool question from leddle526 have you ever had a moment where you almost gave up being a dm entirely giving up dm entirely giving up on a campaign almost actually the start of the campaign i did before this one with my buddy zach hanks we were both co-dming this one and we had a number of friends in there louie our buddy brian who looked like a dwarf and played a dwarf and chloe dykstra some of you may know from some of her stuff she played saga the rogue and then marisha came in eventually to be an assassin but in that campaign the first couple sessions we had a guy and his wife playing with us who made twins he was a paladin and i think she was a cleric and our first two sessions he got really drunk very quickly and became unruly he became belligerent and was interrupting everybody else making sexual jokes in the middle of other people's turns and turned it into a him show and it was not very respectful he's a nice guy but once he got drunk it was a problem so after two games of that happening and the final one we were in the middle of a boss battle sequence a very serious moment and he was yelling and making stupid jokes and fart noises and talking about how he was going to attack with his dick and it wasn't even his turn we're like buddy calm down i could see his wife was embarrassed by it and i was like it's all right finally during somebody else's turn he jumped up and shouted something obscene i can't even remember knocked his beer over all over the battle map and smeared all of the crowd so i said the wall begins to collapse of the ceiling and unfortunately a portion of the cavern was in your direction as both of your characters are crushed as you escape and i killed off their characters i apologized to her after but i was like i don't think this is going to fit and she is like i understand no worries so he stopped playing in the campaign he felt bad about it but it was for the best he's a great guy now his name's andrew he's a really nice fellow but our styles of gameplay didn't quite match and that's fine that's the thing too there's so many different ways to play d&d even critical role-- actually i want to talk about this a little bit people keep saying critical role it's the best example there is for d&d it's not it's really not it's an example of d&d it's a way to play the game it's a way that we play because we're actors and as actors we're naturally more focused on narrative and characterization and the drama of the element there our version of d&d plays more to the story than it does the rules per se as you can see some of the players haven't locked in all the rules sometimes but it's because we're more focused on other aspects of the game and that's fine we still have a good time we're an example of how it can play there are elements of our game that you might like and take into your home campaign and there are a lot of people that watch it that if they were to play in it would probably not enjoy it at all and there are a lot of people--trust me i've seen comments i've been tweeted people saying like your game looks like shit i would never enjoy it and i'm like you're probably right and there are games out there that people play that i probably wouldn't enjoy either but that's what's cool about it there's so many different ways to play it there's so many different ways you can run it for the players and all the styles are enjoyable for players that are looking for that type of experience so yeah that's an example of-- andrew would be great at a table like a harmon-town type ridiculous drunkard debauchery table he'd do great there for those of who are paying a little more respect to the narrative and the intensity of a sequence didn't quite match up very well and you both respectfully talk and go guys this isn't going to work out and that's fine so keep that in mind also for all you guys who are new to d&d don't expect a critical role experience at your table partially because once again we're professional actors and we've been playing this for a long time before we started the stream when we first started playing our first few games it was nothing like this it was a lot of fumbling and what do i do they were all just learning how to play and some games are a little more rules heavy the gamers and the dm are more involved in the actual game aspect of it and that's rad i've had a lot of sessions like that before they've been a lot of fun too but you want to make sure you establish those boundaries and adjust your expectations every game table is going to be different every experience you have at the table is going to be different from what you've seen in my or the roleplay guys or acquisitions inc or high rollers or any other great show all of them are different and unique because that's how every table experience is playing d&d that's part of what makes it so special so i ask you guys don't get angry if your first or second d&d game isn't like critical role because it can't be nor could our game ever be like yours they're wholly unique in their own right so abandon expectation which by the way is a great term a great guide for life in general abandon expectation try and move forward and do your best and that goes for your d&d game as well so i recommend that anyway do we have a name answer on this one k-apostrophe-r-y-y-n so k'ryyn the drow baker k'ryyn the drow baker whose interest is involving bringing tary home and they have a secret that involves a ziggurat of some kind (evil laugh) good to know starrybright brings up a question what do i think about the mcelroy boys and the show adventure zone they're phenomenal it's a great show if you haven't had a chance to see it the podcast the adventure zone it's great they run a d&d game there i would say it's a less serious tone than critical role but they have serious moments as well they have a lot of dramatic moments it's a podcast form it's a lot less rules heavy than ours which ours is not as rules heavy as some other games so like i said it's a spectrum but the adventure zone's great the mcelroys are fantastic travis is fantastic we've talked a bit online and i'm a big fan of what they do so if you haven't had the opportunity check it out i recommend it they're fantastic and they also do a great job of representing the importance of community and support others in the community they're generally rad people so highly recommend you check it out too let's pick another question here i'd be curious to see some non-d&d related non-voice over i want to make this part of a conversation of just random shit also because i answer a lot of questions on panels and stuff so if you have any burning questions about silly things or life things we can get real i'm all for that if you want to make this almost a hearken back to the honesty hours days of the early twitch stream i'm totally fine with that so be okay with going into that regard did you talk with any of the critical role guests about how they spent the year time skip from scottyknows yes i did we actually met last night for about four or five hours going over all that so that'll be coming up soon so look forward to that oh wow it's all exploding i saw someone ask triss or yennefer i was a triss girl until witcher 3 and then i began to lean yennefer a little bit but i went back to triss i'm a triss person through and through now i think i mean i'm marrying a redhead so i feel like i'm a little biased yennefer was a love that was built by magical force that eventually blossomed into an actual attraction if you play it right triss i felt was a genuine attraction that came naturally so that to me was something very important so i think i'm a triss guy to answer that i once said yennefer but that's changed since then as some things do hughmillerc asks how do you want to do this with alcohol calranig asks can we see more dwarves love their accent i'd love that i love the brogue it's my favorite the scots style is one of my favorite ones to do i enjoy it thoroughly across the spectrum of even soft scots which is more of the casual conversational type i love that it's got a nice almost poetic lilt to it i love speaking in it i love hearing it i love it it's my favorite way of doing it usually when you think about dwarf you think more classic video game style and world of warcraft aye well bring me to the orcs but for me the softer scot is more nice too the more refined and more conversational type i love it so i would like to do that more but only if dwarves work in the story and they are a threat in many circumstances favorite animated movie i saw that go by real fast aw man does who framed roger rabbit count it's half-animated i'm going to say it works because it's one of my favorite movies of all time and not only is it a technical achievement and a narrative achievement but such an amazing cast one of the last big projects that mel blanc got to work on and actually do his warner brothers characters it's a perfect film in so many ways i love who framed roger rabbit and it should and will never get remade because it's one of those films that only worked in that era and could never be made again so that's definitely it someone asked about having another person become a permanent member of vox machina or the campaign i'm going to say no to that i mean seven players is already a lot when ashley's not here even six is a lot so i think we're good we're solid with this number six to seven players is good and that gives us enough room to occasionally have a guest but i feel like stretching the attention a bit and i do want to have guests on occasionally to add their narrative and to mix it up a little bit but i don't think we're going to bring another permanent member on in my opinion it's a lot to concentrate on and i'm already stretched thin as it is thank you for understanding have i ever been charged with a crime no i've been interrogated by police this is a funny story back in high school i was walking to my friend todd hunt's house to go play rifts i had my rifts character my binder my dice and everything in a bag he lived not that far from my girlfriend of the time mira i would on the way walking to his house i was going to stop by and say hi but she wasn't home apparently i walked up rang the doorbell nobody there i looked at the window to see if anybody was home went up and looked at her bedroom window wasn't home so i continued walking over to my friend todd's place about five ten minutes later a bunch of cop cars pulled up because apparently the cops were really bored in agoura hills they stopped me and they were like hey so what's going on what are you wandering in this neighborhood for i'm like i'm just going to visit my girlfriend but she wasn't home so i'm going to go to my friend todd oh really what's in the bag i'm like my lord magus oc why so i hand them my character binder and my dice apparently i guess they got a call that there was a prowler with a bag of tools lurking around the house one of the paranoid neighbors but i had the experience of them interrogating me over my character sheet and asking if there were any drugs on my dice and like smelling and licking them i was like come on guys really okay we're good we good he's like yeah okay go ahead thank you i grab my bag and i start walking on to my friend todd's house he's like i thought you were visiting the girlfriend it's up the road right i'm like well i mean no one was home so-- i'm a terrible i get nervous anyway so he's like huh well if that's true i'll drive you i'll drive you to go see your girlfriend i'm like uh and i got really freaked out because my girlfriend's mom hated me at the time because i wasn't a doctor or from the middle east she was lebanese so i was like oh god the last thing i want is to have the police show up at the door with me and her mom's there it would be terrible thankfully she wasn't and the cop didn't really do it and everything was fine but that was my really nervous run-in with the police with my rifts game character there you go little story for you to take home ah boy question am i going to dragoncon this year no and i don't know if i'll ever be to dragoncon again because unfortunately it happens at the same time as burning man every year i went back in 2004 and 2005 where i cosplayed as dan hibiki and mugatu from the first zoolander because that's what you do when you're at dragoncon had a great time but since burning man becomes a little more of a creative and spiritual retreat for me every year that takes precedence so i don't know if we'll ever get back unless they change the weekend but it's a lot of fun i have a lot of friends that go so have a good time what's our little question nebuchadnezzar asks what's the story behind each of your bracelets this is interesting i know people i've seen people make fun of the fact that i wear these leather bracelets and it's a fashion statement and it seems so douchey and rockstar-like to wear and fair play this was the first one i got right here this was a magnet-based bracelet and i received this actually at my first burning man this to me represents personal responsibility and knowing where i come from i come from a bloodline of alcoholics my father also dealt with drug addiction he was a musician in the 70s and 80s he went to narcotics anonymous for a while-- i'm opening up here wonderful man i love him to death he was and is such a wonderful person but he dealt with addiction issues and so knowing i was predisposed to all of this i avoided alcohol i avoided anything i didn't even have my first drink until i was 23 i was so scared that i was predisposed as i began to know myself better as a person in my life i decided i felt that i wasn't possibly held by the same demons that my family before me did so i tried alcohol and was like okay yeah this might be socially a thing but it's not for me and so i'd occasionally have a drink socially but it wasn't a big thing i felt that was a big thing for me then my first burning man being surrounded by drug culture and having a lot of my judgments on various experiences that i had friends who had and talked about and i was like eh no no no-- that was my time to actually face those demons as well and so i had a number of experiences at the burn that year with friends in a safe environment where i could try different things safe things but so i could speak with these from a basis of understanding safe hallucinogens and things like that in a very nice environment the end of that week i realized that i really firmly understood that i was not bound by the same demons of addiction that my father did and my grandfather before him i met a random person on my last day that week and we met at the edge of the trash fence far out into the desert we talked for two hours and i told him all about this history and they gave me this bracelet as a reminder that i overcame my family's demons and as a reminder of the responsibility that i have to make sure that i stay true to myself and try and help others to not befall those same traps so that was where i got my first bracelet and i wear it all the time the second one i got because marisha made it for me on our first anniversary she bought the leather she dyed it herself she punched it and if you see in there a little bit you can see coordinates that she pushed into the leather these coordinates are the coordinates on the earth where we had our first kiss this was a beach on pch under the moonlight because we've got to be cheesy and romantic and shit but she gave that to me as a reminder of that night and so this bracelet to me is a reminder of her and so i keep that with me at all times this one was given to me by my best friend brittany walloch who i've known for over ten years she's been a dear friend confidante and helped me get through a lot of hard times and been there for me i know it's fucking cheesy but you asked guys sorry so this to me represents the friends and the people that i have to support me and help me through the hard times and are understanding when i get busy or get sad and so this one represents friendship to me this one here was a gift from a critter during one of the critmases little tree of life on there if you get a chance to see this was important to me because this represents you guys this represents the community represents everyone who has come along with us on these adventures the critical role and how you changed my life in so many wonderful ways so this i wear this all the time because it reminds me of you guys and what we're doing in all this crazy silliness so now you have the story behind my wrist bands probably the deepest explanation of them i've given to date i may have said too much about myself but whatever that's what this afternoon's about there you go all right the question how did you and marisha meet i'll try to make this a lot quicker than the last story me and marisha met through a mutual friend becky young who was an actress friend of mine she played samus in my web series i did back in 2008-2009 called there will be brawl if you haven't seen it it's silly live-action film noir crime drama of the smash bros universe she was doing improv and in one of her improv classes marisha had just started doing improv so they became close friends and began doing scene work and sketches together then becky was going to create a geeky sketch group for the internet she called in a bunch of her friends to be writers and actors on it she called me in matt key and a few friends that she met through brawl then brought marisha over from her improv so we met at that first writing meeting and we both immediately crushed on each other but we were both in other relationships and like nice to meet you that was you know we became loose friends met at a couple social events over the next year or so but we you know we were this distant aw if only but alas then about a year after that we reconnected after not seeing each other for a while i'll get to the tattoo in a minute i had gone in for a mo-cap audition and they wanted to know if i knew any females who had dance experience martial arts experience i was like marisha does so i got her an audition there and she called me to say thank you can i pay you back with a drink some time i'd love to we never actually had a chance to hang out one-on-one before so we went and got a drink and talked four and a half hours and we clicked it was an electric dinner everything was perfect i was like oh my god this is amazing i had been out of my last relationship for about nine ten months at this time and spent a period of time being single tried the dating thing and it was weird didn't like it and i was spending a lot of time being solitary she was on the outskirts of a long-term relationship that had been dead in the water for about six months according to her so we went our own ways about a week later she called me and was like hey i just broke up with my boyfriend do you want to get a drink i need to talk to somebody i'm like sure so we went out and got drinks again from there we began to hang out more and it eventually turned into a romance and the rest is history now we're getting married in october which is crazy anyway tattoo so this is my first tattoo right there this represents the art car of our burning man camp the sensitron 5000 it's a triangular metallic platform built on a truck bed that has a large led umbrella that comes off the top of it it's hard to describe if you do a search for sensitron 5000 burning man you might see a picture of it there's these big colored silks that hang off of it but anyway this tattoo is a geometric drawing of the art car and it's a little reminder of that little part of burning man home and a place where me and marisha have had many great times together with a good camp family out there so that's what the tattoo means now let's start getting onto the creature let's do some fun stuff here so for the creature for the encounter who has more shoes me or marisha marisha i own like two pairs of shoes and they're both busted actually one's a little better i replaced it not too long ago but i'm not a clothing shoe person these are the fanciest socks i own okay so for the monster encounter for the first bit here i want to ask this creature what size do we want this creature to be i'll throw the ones out you guys don't have to put things in there because it's a limited course here i'll go with tiny because what would be greater than a really powerful super tiny boss fight medium large gargantuan and small so tiny small medium large and gargantuan i think that's all no huge i missed huge so we'll do tiny medium large huge and gargantuan i don't think we need to worry about small because if we're going to go tiny go tiny right so those are the five tiny medium large huge gargantuan we'll throw that in the straw poll and we'll see where that one ends up soon now getting back to the questions here martyr85 asks when you get a rare chance to play is there a personality trait you have that you purposely try to avoid while roleplaying i try to avoid the batman persona kind of like i'm dark and broody and i know everything and i'm badass and whenever anything story or emotional happens i don't care i don't want to play drizzt do'urden basically i've played with so many players over the years that all fall into that archetype don't get me wrong i love drizzt as a character but that set up a precedent in the late '90s and early 2000s that most guy gamers i gamed with tended to lean in that bruce willis action-movie-star-type persona that got a little ridiculous for a while so i try and make things a little more kooky i do try and make my characters after the rest of the party has so i can fill in the gap i'm a support player i guess in that regard so i'll wait for everyone else to choose what they want and i'll see what's missing and then i'll go ahead and create something to fill that space that's generally how i do it and i recommend you do it too it might force you into some uncomfortable territory you might end up playing a class that you normally wouldn't have chosen but realize that was actually pretty fun and a lot cooler than i thought it would be you can learn a lot that way just saying whatever happened to the aasimar kids we'll find out still in whitestone from what you guys know which by the way there's a lot of npcs lot of npcs in this world i can't show them all all the time when they become relevant they'll arrive or if the party searches for them they'll be there maybe but there's a lot of characters that i put in this world as i realized over time and it's getting a little nuts so sorry if one of your favorites hasn't showed up in a while it's a big world vox machina can only cover so much ground at any given point in time sorry actually do we have an answer on that one [offscreen] tiny almost 99 percent almost 99 percent tiny i love you guys so much i'm so excited for an extremely powerful tiny beast i'm so excited for this oh my god oh i was hoping you were going to say that okay so tiny creature now type creature type i'm going to have you guys throw some in the chat room these include undead monstrous beast aberration construct any of the classic monster manual creature types start throwing them into chat and i'll start pulling out the ones that seem to get more votes as we go yeah fiends is one pixies fey we'll throw fey on there fey seems to have gotten a few votes aberration's getting a bunch of votes as well construct's getting a lot of votes so we've got fey aberration construct oh man a lot of that celestial i'm seeing celestial a lot in there and we'll say elemental there we go those are some five interesting choices those are the ones i've seen the most at least so there we go we have fey we have construct we have elemental we have aberration and-- what was the last one celestial there we go so we'll get that straw poll going and we'll figure out what that is here in a moment i'm going to go ahead and pour a little port in here oh look at that fine fire that totally real fire it's real don't judge me i have not had a drink on a tuesday this early at least not a while that wasn't a margarita okay so iamvirus asks skyrim or witcher 3 witcher 3 i love me some elder scrolls i've played them all since arena but witcher 3 all the way i'm sayin' deslog asks question wine whiskey or vodka i would have said vodka years ago but i've come to enjoy whiskey more in recent years that happens when your girlfriend's from kentucky she brings bourbon into your life but even then i'm not a heavy drinker so it'll be like one drink it'd probably be whiskey probably mixed with something i'm a girly drinker i want sweet shit i can enjoy a nice straight harsh liquor as a sipping drink but give me a mojito give me a margarita give me something nice and fruity and sweet i'll deal with the headache it'll be fine zzz195 asks how do you deal with rejection oh man not well at first i remember when i was in seventh grade--because i got rejected a lot--i had a very interesting upbringing or at least a very interesting childhood i had a lot of asking girls out whenever i got the courage and them saying yes on the spot and the next day going actually no and that sucked i had a pe teacher named mr pickett who-- i just wouldn't get up and run the mile in seventh grade after a girl turned me down a girl named-- i think it was jamie in choir chorus and he was like is it a girl i'm like yeah he goes it's okay man women are fickle which is a douchey thing to say now in hindsight but at the time it helped pulled me out of my funk and he gave me a dude-to-dude girl talk and i was like oh i feel better rejection sucks no matter what happens but you have to remember rejection is not because you are a lesser person much like an audition you just weren't the right person don't take a rejection if it's from an individual you're asking out as an offense or that they don't want to have anything to do with you sometimes it's just you're not what i'm looking for i don't know you well enough and some great friendships i've seen come out of rejection from multiple sides but there is a habit i've seen and a lot of this nice guy syndrome happen online where it's like i will be a friend to a girl and the minute that i begin to ask her out and she says 'no' then i'm like 'fuck her' and it's an unhealthy behavior because you're missing opportunities for great friendship and two she just wasn't into that aspect at least not now give her time to get to know you better or let it blossom into a friendship and focus on somebody else who might be more your style as far as career rejection-- keep focused on the next venture the more you obsess and concentrate on any sort of rejection or falling out of a prospective path it's hard but if you focus on the next endeavor and try and be like okay that didn't work out what can i focus on now that not only takes your mind off of it but it already gets you in a better direction focusing on what's right and what could be the next venture yeah i had a lot of interesting experiences as a kid actually i want to bring this up real fast because i feel like it's important i want to apologize legitimately to anybody who felt uncomfortable in the story of the last taryon episode and the reveal there and i apologize if that hit too close to home if that was not the representation of your story that you wanted seen and i understand that it made a lot of people feel uncomfortable and i'm sorry i'm legitimately sorry i put a post about it on twitter but text is easy to be misconstrued and you only have so much brainspace to put out there and i'm sure i've been torn apart on the internet that's fine i admit that however i do want to say that i think it's an important story to tell from what we understand of it and when i say what we understand of it y'know we all come from different backgrounds and-- this is going to be a little real here for a second we have our experiences to pull from when it comes to story we as actors we write and we only create from experience and exandria is very much an open environment for the most part sexuality is an open thing in society there are couples of all walks of life asexual trans nonbinary gay bi everything and it's all open in the world is the world free of ignorance no that's part of life and part of the story because people are flawed people are stupid it's minimized in my world because i like to imagine a world where it is largely minimized but it's not something that's not going to exist and what little bit of tary's story we've touched on a lot of it improvised by sam on the spot and a lot we've talked about since then and we developed a little bit beforehand to an extent i think is an important story to tell and parts of it resonate i've had people concerned that we were making fun of his awakening or his coming to terms with his venture in the last episode and i can honestly say that if it came across that way i'm sorry that is not the case we are very very sensitive to these things and many of us have lived very close to or dealt with homophobia on our end as well i grew up a very androgynous long-haired pretty boy who was quiet and god knows i spent a number of years of my youth being called faggot and being pushed around and i have a lot of very very important people in my life who have dealt with far worse and have undergone a lot of terrible circumstances and i feel for that a lot my uncle ted for instance one of the most impactful people in my life probably at a young age he was my dad's brother he introduced me to musical theater he introduced me to andrew lloyd webber's phantom of the opera we used to play piano and sing songs around the piano and stuff and he's such a wonderful person and as a kid i loved him he was my favorite relative on that side of the family he also dealt with the difficulty of being married and having a child with his wife and then one day coming to terms with the fact that he was gay and it sundered a lot of that part of the family at the time and it was very hard to be in parts of the family that didn't understand that and even as a kid i knew what was wrong and what felt wrong and what was being said and you know and then getting-- and then i had to watch him waste away over the years because he caught hiv and then aids at a time when it was very prominent in the late '80s and early 90s and then you know through the '90s in a lot of ways was very hard for people of alternative sexualities because we didn't have communities we didn't have the internet we didn't have tumblr we didn't have facebook there weren't places you could go to feel safe if your lifestyle was expected to be not the norm or not accepted so i had a lot of friends and a lot of close people that had to just suffer inside and had nowhere to talk and occasionally meet somebody or find somebody who was comfortable enough to be out and proud and then permission was given but even that was met with a lot of difficulty i'm glad we live in a world now by comparison where things are much more respected and it's still a fight god it's still a fight there's still so much to be done and it's still so much bullshit and so much disrespect and lack of empathy for people who just want to be happy and that bothers me on a deep level and feel it really hard but i know that parts of tary's tale may not be the representation that some people hoped for in media but i've tried my best to represent other happier lives and things where that was an open and viable circumstance tary's is important for people that grew up like maybe a lot of my friends did and didn't have that open welcoming scenario and i can't believe i'm doing this on the internet anyway i'm sorry i'm doing the best i can and not all stories are going to be for everybody i can't please everybody with all the choices we make and i mess up and i fail and i stumble and even if a few people get offended i can't help but feel bad because i hate hurting people but i promise i'm doing my best that's all you know when i said tary's experience his scenario at the end of the last episode with trish reminded me of a lot of friends growing up you know every person has a point in life where they struggle with their own identity and i had that too i identify as heterosexual but i've had my years of curiosity i've had my years of trying to figure out what it was who i was and yeah i myself am primarily attracted to women but there are men that i've also found attractive in life mostly about the person the individual and sometimes it takes an experience like what tary had to finally feel confident in that and not in a judgmental way his was a little more comical because it's sam and we want to play up the discomfort of a sequence sometimes with humor to offset it but we try and treat it with respect because a lot of it plays to elements of our own lives or people that are close to us and so tary's journey is in some ways still a personal one for myself and other people in some ways so just you know we're trying anyway wow that happened let's go to the next monster thing (laughing) jesus christ (sighs) so tiny what type of monster we doing yo celestial tiny celestial encounter that's going to be-- oh i'm good no pizza thank you i got popcorn and port yo and a fireplace what more could you want ability score focus what is this tiny celestial really good at we're going to make this a six choice a six choice straw poll here so we're going to go ability scores of course strength dexterity constitution intelligence wisdom charisma the classics i want to know what this tiny celestial is really damn good at what is it really good at so we're going to put that in there have you guys vote and we'll see just how nasty this thing can be so pay attention to the chat we'll have that up there in a moment we're going to go ahead and do some more questions and i'll keep it together going forward (laughs) talisar question how excited are you for the new bill nye show i actually watched a few episodes of it i'm conflicted i love bill nye and i grew up loving bill nye and i'm a firm believer in everything he has to say i think in some ways we're entering this weird era that is undermining intellectualism and fact and it's really frustrating and i think he's been a great beacon for that in public spheres the tone of his show is a little strange because i feel like it's a little preaching to the choir so far i feel like it would be a better message to try and have the show presented in a way that is speaking to the other side and explaining why it's important to listen to what the facts or what the science is the show so far from what i've seen comes across a little preachy and a little condescending to those who many not believe and i don't think that necessarily befits his argument in the best way it's still a great show and i'm liking it so far but that would be my one critique on it is that it comes across a little self-righteous in a way that might turn off the people who really should be listening to it and learning from it otherwise it turns into an echo chamber but i'm excited to check out the rest of it and hope that that picks up a little bit and i love everything he's done in the past i think it's important that we have more figures like that that are both public figures like neil degrasse tyson and bill nye that are champions of science champions of reason champions of fact and i'm excited to see more of that type of content i'll see more of it i will say the new mystery science theater is fucking awesome as a person who grew up watching the original comedy central run when i was a kid when i first moved out to california i'm a joel guy i love mike but joel is my guy all the way and i've watched every episode i was so scared for the reboot so scared because it could have gone wrong in so many ways i legitimately teared up multiple times watching the first episode of the new netflix show because it felt like the old show to me i was so excited even the final credits sequence they even have a new version of the old sad orchestral version of the mst3k theme and i was just tears and smiling i tend to cry a lot i'm a sensitive boy if you haven't figured that out by now ability score focus do we have an answer on that yet what is it charisma this'll be interesting okay let's do three focuses here this will be combat-focus for the creature so it's a tiny celestial charisma-based entity do we want it to be melee-focused not mee-lee i'm trying to be better about that i grew up saying mee-lee and it's an old habit hard to break i know it's melee i'm trying guys i know it bothers a lot of you melee ranged-focused or spell-focused or you know what environment-focused so it might get in the fray with people it might attack them from a distance it might do a spell caster type or focused on using the environment to its advantage we'll throw those choices up in the poll and we'll see what that one comes out to in a moment an hour and a half goes fast guys thanks for chilling as long as you have and watch me be ridiculous on camera with you for a while scrubsfan06 asks a question what's your favorite band oh that's a tough one my father was a musician i was raised on the beatles moody blues steely dan al parsons project so i come from that background then i was also introduced more to modern bands i say modern i was a kid of the 90s like stone temple pilots type o negative-- love type o negative great pseudo-almost-not-serious goth rock it's beautiful but i think the musician that's affected me the most would be mike patton and his work on mr bungle many other musical projects that are fantastic fantomas tomahawk lovage some of his solo stuff but his work on mr bungle is so avant-garde and strange and changed my perspective on music and vocals gogol bordello is a great choice too gogol bordello is fantastic mike patton's work has been heavily inspiring in so many ways he's probably the closest i have as far as a vocal match when it comes to music so if there's anybody i can sing along with in the car mr bungle i'm right there i have a secret dream that ever i end up with too much time on my hands that i'll do a mr bungle tribute band and do a show once in the roxie just for my friends i want to do that one day will it ever happen i don't know mike patton's my boy straw poll's up guys you got to vote lolkeegan says matt kind of stagnant in life with no direction do you have any friends or were you yourself like that how did you find your direction and motivation or whatever yeah a number of times that's not an uncommon experience if anything take solace in the fact that all of us eventually find ourself there at some point or another before i went to burning man i was in that place out of school i was in that place right before i met marisha to a certain extent i was in that place too change of scenery helps more than anything being stuck stagnant and being in a place of comfort that is affiliated with that stagnation in my opinion can be a very stifling atmosphere without realizing it i recommend taking a drive by yourself just drive if you're near a coast up the coast and find a bit of beach to sit and think for a few hours on your own bring some snacks bring some wine or go into the desert or go into the woods and commune with your surroundings go to a place that's outside of what's normal and comfortable to you both to force yourself out of your comfort zone but to put you in a space where you can start thinking outside of the way you normally do i can't say that's a guaranteed answer but that can begin to help with forcing you to think outside of the normal woe is me i can't do anything i can't change anything you've already changed one thing you've changed your scenery you've already discovered a new place that you can go to for solace a place you can bring a friend once you have these moments to think to yourself maybe try a hobby you've always wanted to and never gave yourself the gumption to do it you were always like i've always wanted to try sculpting do it buy some clay look on youtube there's so many great tutorials for anything you could ever want to do ever period on the internet now buy some clay and start sculpting in your house or go to a class if there's one nearby that you can afford do some life drawing something artistic something creative something that spurs the brain outside of the numbers and the mathematics that may be enough of a change of your normal way of thinking that it might inspire different directions to look it might lead your right on the path or put you in that direction there's no guarantee there's no right answer to this but that's something that's worked for me and it's worked for some people i know at least it might be a start wish i had better answers for you but i hope that helps what's the answer on the straw poll environment not going to lie i was hoping you were going to say that that's going to be a fun fucked up battle okay and last but not least let's get a name whatever cool first names come out of the chat i'll start pulling them and we'll put them in with a straw poll based off that don't be offended if i don't pick yours i'm going to grab ones that seem interesting and throw them up there look here for a second you guys throw the chaos at me let's do k-a-e-o-r-a let's do b-a-l-k-a-n-u-s y-o-r-t e-x-e-l-o-n ooh i like that one symphior symphony but s-y-m-p-h-i-o-r going celestial here folks l-e-t-h apostrophe e-s-s symphior i think it was symphony s-y-m-p-h-i-o-r and we'll put that in i hope that's right if it's not that's what it is now we'll get that started and we'll start pouring through some answers on that we'll see what names comes to congratulations oh man i've already got some ideas on this one these might not appear very soon in the arc but they're going to be worked into the arc it'll be a surprise to you guys as it will be for the players when they come and we'll work this out should be fun we got about 20 minutes here i want to get some more questions what instrument would you play from kosawankenobi funny my father a musician played many instruments i got a lot of instruments for christmas over the years messed them for a day lost interest and gave them to my little brother who then became the musician he plays trumpet trombone guitar drums piano everything i'm bookended by extremely talented musicians and all i do is sing i'm a little sheepish about instruments i'm a decent drummer in rock band i hover in that hard to expert level or at least i was in my heyday i've gotten a little rusty since then i'm sure but if i could play like really play i'd probably go-- any instrument violin i love the violin it's such a beautiful instrument such a beautiful sound that can evoke so many rich emotions you can tell a story through just a note i've had my heart tugged on and smashed and uplifted by just a single solo violin piece it's a beautiful instrument and it takes a lot of practice anyone out there who plays violin all the power to you all the love i don't have the time maybe one day maybe in my retirement i'll learn to play the violin but that's definitely my favorite instrument of all kungfupanzer asks how is this date going are we going to see each other again does marisha mind i think it's a great-- probably going great until i emotionally spilled all over you that's when you retract and go okay this guy's a bit much he's got some baggage we'll be good friends and we'll probably hang out and get drinks and i'll introduce you to marisha we'll all go out and wander the cia bar of north hollywood probably and drink over a dead clown under a glass that's a real phrase about a real thing you should look it up it's terrifying buttassbooty said did you ever mow your lawn i did i said that earlier but i wanted to say your name out loud so there you go congratulations question do i like camping from asimilie i love camping i love it so much i don't get to go anywhere near as often as i'd like i think we're trying to plan a vox machina group camping trip as soon as we all get time because we all have wanted to do that for a long time trying to find a weekend that'll work i love camping i went a lot with my family we'd go up to mount whitney through all the mountain ranges up through big sur yeah camping was great my mom was hilarious she loved to camp but she also loved some amenities she was the only person i knew who would get up in the morning and heat up her curling iron in the campfire to do her hair while camping my mom i love her to death that's a memory i will always hold dear in my heart crouched down dirty heating up her curling iron that's awesome interesting other questions what music are you listening to at the moment from pwnagepanda a lot of chvrches as you've probably seen from the shirt every single tiny trickle of lorde that comes out i obsess over and latch onto right now good edm i enjoy as a good general creative space i say good edm because there's a lot of shitty edm i briefly fell in love with the chainsmokers then quickly fell out of love with them after seeing interviews with the douchebros that are them good edm i really enjoy classic radiohead never dies paranoid android era was fantastic spotify's allowed me go back and listen to a lot of old songs from my teen years that i hadn't had access to in awhile so that's pretty rad we got really heavily into chvrches right around the time me and marisha got engaged so chvrches has been our happy theme for a while the most recent album that's a recurring theme with us recently favorite sweet alcoholic beverage from aquajolt if we're going dancing and i don't want to spend a lot of time drinking or spend a lot of money on multiple drinks i'll get a long island iced tea because you just need one and it gets the job done and you're ready to go dancing if it's more of a casual conversation if we're all at a small dive bar talking for hours i'll probably get a kentucky mule some bourbon ginger beer little bit of lime and sip on that for a while those are probably my two current favorites utility purposes different definitely question worst video game i've ever played by timmy32 oh man there are some bad games but they're known to be bad i worked on some bad games i worked on a whole bunch of shrek titles my job before becoming a voice actor i worked in qa in game development side then worked into producing in game development i worked at a company tdk media active for a number of years and made shrek licensed products that were terrible shrek party mario party ripoff but it was shrek-related that was really bad oh man there were some really bad games fallout brotherhood of steel the turn-based rts tried to make as a fallout fan who loved fallout one and two broke my heart because it was not a good game for me having a broken game is terrible but having a broken game with a great license is even more painful that really kills me houndrider9000's question ever consider short hair yes i don't look good with it i don't think so not for me long hair's been my thing for most of my life long-ish i've gone through stages you've seen it shorter sometimes on the show yeah i cut it a little shorter and it eventually grows out i just don't look good with short hair i feel cold and naked and alone if it's too short i don't like it so my hair will probably be some degree of long-ish or at least ragged i guess zenez8 says favorite voice line and what one bugs marisha the most favorite voice line it is a gift it is an absolute blessing that i have been given a catchphrase in mccree i'm going to have it with me the rest of my days as much as people might be like oh my god he's so annoyed to have to say 'it's high noon' all the time it's like no that's fantastic i'm always happy to say it if someone's very respectful about it and not be like hey matt what time is it i'd be like all right dude relax that's wonderful that's a catchphrase very few people get that so i love it i'm really excited that i have that that would probably be the most iconic quote that i have character line bothers marisha the most any of the maccready post-romance wakeup lines from fallout 4 we'll wake up in the morning sun's coming through our blinds in the bedroom and she's starting to wake up and i'll lean over and be like (maccready voice) so are you ready to face the day (normal voice) and she'll punch me rightfully so i'll give her shit about that every now and then (laughs) playgratchansee question is any tips on how to deal with players who fight over items and gold talk to them and say guys seriously you need to work this out otherwise we're not going to play be respectful and figure this out if there's still a problem maybe have them encounter some sort of extremely powerful archfey entity that is true neutral and really feels everything should be fair and has found interest in them and follows them silently invisibly if at any point they start fighting over loot threatens them with complete and utter destruction so be fair and place nice otherwise the fey will destroy and consume you find story reasons to fuck with them and force them to play nice too (laughs) cursed items also a great deal that really greedy guy who keeps grabbing everything throw him a couple of cursed items and let him deal oh man you took that first put it on oh no you're withering good on you for that chat that's another great suggestion communist fey yes exactly question star wars or star trek and why interesting question i grew up loving fantasy high fantasy's my jam i should love star wars as much as the next person i enjoy star wars and i watch the trilogy a lot but i wasn't into it as a lot of kids i knew i used to have all the toys the bedsheets everything but i was a tolkien kid for me it was either high fantasy or high fantasy in space to me i leaned more high fantasy but i love the original trilogy and i watched it a bunch as a kid too when i got into star trek right around the next generation era when that first came out that was so radically different than anything i had gotten into that i immediately leaned towards that so my very realistic sci-fi star trek utopian society the future exploring the cosmos in a very colonizing harmony-type way was so radically different than any other sci-fi i had experienced outside of asimov and arthur c clarke books i had grown up with that i fell in love with that i definitely started more as a star trek person i've come to enjoy star wars more as the years go on but i think star trek had more of an impact on my youth i had lord of the rings as more of my fantasy and star trek as more of my sci-fi star wars is in the middle i adhered to the two extremes if that makes sense don't hate me on the internet too late phalanx66 question new tattoo i do have some new ideas when the campaign guide is over and out there i'm going to talk with marisha i haven't decided yet but i'm thinking about getting the outline of tal'dorei tattooed on my back just the outline of the continent and with each campaign guide if they keep happening i'll add more continents until eventually i have all of exandria on my back as just outlines it's an idea i've had an idea don't know if it's going to happen but you know that was something that came up favorite action movie character hudson hawk if you don't know who that is you should watch it it's ridiculous (laughs) nerd i know i know and i own it i should favorite doctor from doctor who from fireknight7 oh we've got ten minutes left thank you for the reminder favorite doctor i grew up on baker so he was my introduction to the world doctor who was originally that weird british show that came on at 500am when i'd couldn't sleep or woke up way too early as a kid i'd watch and be like i don't know what's happening but this is weird and awesome so that was my introduction to doctor who was through baker who was a great doctor love his personality his whimsy is great it wasn't until the reboot that it came back that i got back into it and tennant won me over then it's a close match between baker and tennant but i think tennant just wins out because he ran the gamut especially towards the end of his run the fury the warrior doctor elements coming through his sorrow his loss i can't watch his final walk to the tardis after he takes irradiation right before his regeneration without becoming a blubbering absence of non-sad emotion i am an absolute mess mark humes actually from high rollers when i was london years ago i dragged him to the doctor who museum because he hates doctor who i was like you're coming with you because you're my host he hated it the whole time it was me and him and a bunch of kids and it was amazing they had the actual tardis console of the tennant-era tardis and it was all busted up and i was like cool this is the console and i hear this music and i was like where's the music coming from it's really sad that's really familiar i look over and i'm like that's the song of the ood and they have a big screen that had tennant walking through the snow slowly making his way to the tardis and i start bawling i watched the whole sequence of them saying i don't want to go tears everywhere and i'm blubbering heaving sobbing grown man in the middle of a doctor who museum a bunch of kids who are confused and mark with his arms crossed going fucking hell mate it was amazing i've dragged that guy through some shit (laughs) i'm trying to get through some of these questions because we have to close this up soon favorite non-rpg game by acetamichelle that's hard almost all the games i like are rpgs street fighter actually not that hard at all street fighter i grew up playing street fighter hardcore for a brief time i did tournament street fighter and i can still hold my own pretty decently in street fighter there was a time i was super intense about it i got really good my prime of my life was during the alpha three era alpha three is still to this day my game i got really deeply into street fighter not just the competitive aspect but the lore there is street fighter lore it's confusing contradicts itself a lot but i got really into it i owned a lot of japanese-import art books about it that i could only get in little tokyo or order online at the time off ebay i did kuma for halloween one year i've done dan hibiki multiple times i learned a lot of the japanese phrases most japanese i learned-- which is very little-- i learned from fighting games mostly street fighter so if i ever go to japan all i can really do is get into fights not as useful but that it is what it is street fighter guy all the way let's get to some more of these questions at the bottom oh man ghostlymuse question for players who want to have more variety are there any resources you'd recommend for
