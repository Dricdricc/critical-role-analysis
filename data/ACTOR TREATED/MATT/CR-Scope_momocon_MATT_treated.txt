good morning everyone whoa there we go i think we're good morning i saw you were repping with this shirt it made me happy yeah both of our schedules on our badges said this was the main stage so if you have any friends that are there let them know that they're in the wrong place and that it's okay because we were also at the wrong place we almost fought for it too there were guild wars folks there and we were like whose panel is this are you sure it almost happened so welcome to our saturday morning-ish near noonish critical role panel (applause) fantastic so careful with spoilers (alarm beeping) we've got mood lighting now heck yeah and the ominous countdown in the corner so if we have that going like the '24' sound through the whole panel it'd be great we should start with intros mary that's actually how they came up with the idea to make their characters twins is because they share a birthday and i said well that's convenient we have built tumblr trash yes it is a weird reversal for most of my life it's been oh don't let them know you play dungeons & dragons i've been playing since my freshman of high school so 20 years this year i've been playing longer than some of you have been alive oh god that hit me harder than i expected first character i ever made i was invited to the game and i didn't know much about the logistics of it but i wanted to be a wizard because magic practitioners sound like a really cool idea and so i made a wizard this was second edition d&d so i had to learn how thac0 worked and i was like okay what kind of wizard can i make oh there are kits and your kits are ways you customize your character and so i was like oh a militant wizard i get to wield a sword and be a wizard like gandalf cool little did i know it was the most useless kit ever because wizards back then were so dead if you didn't have magic ready so if you get up with a sword and go eh you're dead so it wasn't the best idea but it was fine and we played for a bit but my dm at the time was not the best dm and after we played for a few months i got really frustrated with the style and we had one crux moment during a game that got me so frustrated i just left and decided i'm going to dm my own stuff now i know there's more to this it can be better and i really haven't played characters much since yeah i've played in games i've played a lot of other systems as well but d&d's kinda where my heart is because i'm a big rpg fantasy nerd i love it i love it i think i've really enjoyed second edition because it was all i knew although it had its quirks somehow everyone had 18-100 strength everyone was really lucky when they rolled their character but the math was ridiculous but it had such depth to it and 30 and 35 i felt were really really good ways to allow character customization it did tend to complicate aspects of combat or at least cause a lot of floating modifiers and the math kind of--while less esoteric math-- based around the ac and thac0 equation it didn't lend to a lot of everyone paying attention to okay you get the +1 from here and this gives you +1 to hit and damage from the bard thing oh but you have this bless spell on so it's another +1 to hit from there so +4 but you're also turned away so it's +3 and ugh i just start bleeding from the nose but you know you made it work and it was better than previous editions and fourth edition came out and that was a struggle to certain points i ran a long-term fourth edition game which my friend shawn actually played in here yeah we actually had a great job actually shawn here if you guys are watching the game we did the other night we had the q&a he was the rogue in my ravenloft campaign for two years that ended up taking over the castle after strahd and cut out the bard's tongue and turned him into his own private theon at end of the game a real happy ending there ravenloft fourth edition it had some cool ideas i love the skill challenge aspect of it i felt the idea of the at-will magics-- magic practitioners never actually ran out of spells there was some low-level stuff that they could just do forever it was really great and useful because as a wizard i never wanna have to go well i'm out of spells you shouldn't have that you shouldn't have to be able to only mage hand three times a day i'm like no i don't want to pick up stuff i trained for years in this shit make my book float to me so the fourth edition at-will magics carried over as the cantrips in fifth and so they kept that over which was really nice the skill system was a little more refined and the fifth edition combat and character development still allows a breadth of customization with your character but not overcomplicated and i really felt like they streamlined it in the right ways so i'm really enjoying fifth edition i think it's [audio skips] to be fair those three spells-- they pack a punch there that's one of the things i love about this game in general and any rpg system is everybody who grew up as a kid playing in their front yard kind of fighting windmills like don quixote we all had that period of time where we embraced our imagination and made up stories and went with it and as we grow up society tends to have this trend of pushing that thought away no you must be a realist you must not play you must not be able to get together with people and just be creative for the hell of being creative and rpgs are one of the mediums that continues to allow that to flourish long into adulthood and i think it's such a wonderful therapeutic and positive way of reinforcing social connection with people i've built stronger bonds with the people i've gamed with than most anybody else in my life and there's something about that shared adventure experience that's so wonderful and those memories are real we've never been so torn about promoting a friend's television series go watch blindspot hopefully it'll get a second season so if we can write a petition to blindspot to set the show in la next season that'd be great we'd appreciate that part of this-- since you know the gist of it so far let's open the floor to questions we'll turn this into a q&a we have a microphone-- go ahead and line up behind that microphone and we'll start taking your questions one at time we'll get through as many of you guys as we possibly can as you can see we have a looming 48 47 minutes left all right sir what's your name hi conner-tiffany (shudders) no it is and you definitely tugged a cord there you invoked that which should not be invoked continue no it's a necessary conversation i don't know we're still kind of holding on as to what this show is we had no idea this was going to become whatever it is we had like a six to eight week plan of well if it doesn't work out we'll just go home and keep playing on our own and people found us and resonated and started creating their own games and it just built this community that i never expected it's become so much more important to me than just a game we play now it's introducing other people to it and watching them create their own stories with their friends and send us pictures of their game nights and their families playing now to me it's-- d&d has an unfortunate stigma because of when the time it came out there was a very anti-d&d fundamentalist christian movement that didn't understand the game just saw surface elements and decided that it was evil demons being summoned oh no it's okay it's my people too (southern accent) my family's all from the south as well i fully understand don't think y'all gotta carry that burden just yourself so that put a stigma on it and the media of course ran with it as it does so yeah it got off to a bad start but i think now through geek culture becoming pop culture for better or for worse i think largely for the better you're now seeing a trend of people that grew up playing d&d who grew up writing stories and making up stories with their friends are inheriting the entertainment industry they're becoming the producers and the writers and the directors of films television so that's part of the reason we've had this big surgence in geek culture is because now the people that are creating the media are the geeks we took over and so to your question there i'm not sure where it's going to go i think it's cool that it's bringing it to an audience that didn't have the opportunity to really understand at first there are a lot of people out there that would love to play rpgs but like mary said you just didn't really know what it was and there was a weird-- between the stigma or just intimidation you didn't think it was something you could or would want to do and so through these shows a lot of people message us almost daily saying since i watched your show i went out and bought the books and started a game with my family or with my father and we reconnected through it it's become this really cool re-emergence of tabletop gaming and thanks to other shows like high rollers and the real role play guys and now the dice camera action that wizards does there's this trend now of people showing other people what d&d can be and other rpgs as well like zac who used to run our stream is now doing his hyper rpg go up in seattle and they're doing a bunch of awesome shadowrun games and all these different other types of rpgs as well so will it end up mainstream media i don't know i know there's people trying it because whenever anything seems to be doing well on the internet that means all the executives in a room somewhere with a bunch of suits have to be like how can we capture this and make money so i'm sure we'll see some attempts at that some may be genuine some may not be i think the charm of our show is the fact that we're just a bunch of doofuses that like each other a lot and play for our own amusement not necessarily to make maximum dollar for our company as soon as that gets introduced it kind of gets a little weird and i don't know the flavor gets a little tainted for me so i think as long as people are genuine in producing this content it will still resonate with people so we'll see how the entertainment industry treats it i know we're putting our feet on the ground making sure that it doesn't fall in that category because i would rather jump in front of traffic (laughs) to be fair it's okay to go back in the basement for those of us who don't like light not a fan of sunlight myself basement's cool hi what's your name hi stephanie it's okay okay favorite character in the critical role world victor that's what scares me i don't know where it came from that was a purely improvised character that has become like a staple now there's a good chance when you're the only individual that has discovered black powder in the universe and that's kind of your personality you're not going to be very careful with it we've already seen him blow up once though it was not in canon victor's an interesting one i'm sure he'll show up again same place victor came from i think yeah (chuckles) (laughter) yeah what happened to that skull i know where it went (laughter) i don't plan where they're going to go because i don't know where they're going to go i plan possible places they can go i try and prepare enough to the point where i'm not completely lost if they make random choices but it still happens occasionally for me it's about considering what their discussions have been in the game listening to what their characters have insinuated they might want to do next and then i'll flesh out those avenues they might possibly go so that when they choose that path or this path i have some things prepared for it no the acid river had nothing to do with the rug the acid river had everything to do with wil wheaton being a guest in that episode (laughter) okay so you aren't aware of this wil wheaton used to play on acquisitions inc which is the pax prime live game they did with the official d&d folks and he had a character named aeofel who died horribly in a pit of acid of course it's wil wheaton (laughter) it also just unfortunately happened that the rug got in i was like oh magical enchantments can resist certain things but that's not one of them for a tapestry (laughter) the npcs i have that are the most layered are gilmore and allura and i enjoy playing them both for different reasons because they're both very very layered characters you guys have probably only seen elements of those two and i hope more of that plays out in the future but both those characters are two that i really enjoy jumping into their shoes for a bit they're both very close and personal to me thank you good question hello what's your name yeah yeah that was intense (silence) (laughter) yeah because we could only play once every four to six weeks and so we'd play for a standard eight hours or more sometimes depending we wanted to get as much time as we could when we got the dads away from their kids we had a very short window where we're like all right maximize time then we all go home drained worth it so as far as your question is concerned i've rewatched a lot of them partially because i have to go back and-- it works as a good note-taker as a dm to have the actual episode online i'd be like what-- who did they meet again what npc did they talk to oh crap i'll look it up okay there we go what did that character sound like it's been a helpful tool for me to have that video there have been times where we'd put episodes on in the background when we had to leave our bird alone for a while just so she'd hear our voices (awwing) i don't know she's a bird we found ourselves putting this couple of episodes on and then sitting down and ended up watching a full episode and me and marisha would be like oh we're those people (laughter) the one i probably watched the most just because i love the reactions to it would have been the conclave attack yeah it was holding on to that for two years let me tell you seeming messes up everything in the best way thank you so much all right we have a few people back there we'll try and make these answers more concise my fault sorry hello i see (laughter) oh very cool there are many systems that are a lot faster at character building than d&d d&d is a fairly deep system it's not super deep it's not rifts deep there are other systems that are a lot faster some savage world stuff can be pretty fast to put together if you look online for fast character generation rpgs especially on rpgnet they'll have a lot of examples that i can't think of any off of the top of my head right now dungeon world there you go that's one those are all great systems if it's d&d in particular you can also pre-create characters like generate a character per class if it's their first game and they don't know what to do then instead of having them build it you can have them pick from the list and tweak and customize a few things if they want to and then introduce them to the game that way you have taken the weight off their shoulders i've done that for a few people where i'll create their character for them in advance and they'll show up and be like okay i'll pick this guy and i'm like cool go and the other characters just go away or i make them npcs why not that's my recommendation no worries good question and good luck with he dming dude hey harley harley quinn is more what i would think the maestro i spent a lot of time alone as a kid i don't know for me especially from a dm standpoint it's considering sometimes character regionality or some races might have kitschy themes through them like the dwarves i tend to go scottish not all of them but just because it's classic and i will always make any excuse for myself to do a scottish brogue because it's my favorite dialect ever i love it so much it's like music horrible discordant music akiba's trip yeah they had me do the foreigner voice which is a voice setting you can set for npcs in the game and in the japanese version the foreigner voice is american and they couldn't do that taliesin was like whatever accent you want to do that's not american so i'm like (scottish voice) all right this is your foreigner which is great because you could set the voices to little moe café maids little cute anime girl and you enter and it's like (scottish voice) hello would you like a tea (laughter) as such i think everyone should play that game for that reason alone for me it's just what works for the character what sounds different and unique so they stand out against each other i've made a lot of characters in this world and i don't have that many voices so it's hard to differentiate a lot of the time so i try and find ways whether it be through texture timbre vocal patterns-- accents-- attitude physicality being a dragon can be a dragon (cheering) aww (laughter) good question thank you hello there we go hi what's your name tal'dorei's the main continent that they're in right now yeah westruun is a town in central tal'dorei on tal'dorei-- tal'dorei is a northern continent it starts to crest othanzia is much colder which is the other continent that has vasselheim that's where the slayer's take is that's where the fire ashari exist that one's even further north and that one's most of the time covered in snow or at least some level of cold cloudy weather the northern parts of tal'dorei like whitestone and where kraghammer is-- those are a little more snow-covered but yeah it's a colder continent by nature it's more of the european-type climate marquet is a southern continent that's where ank'harel is and that is a mostly desert continent it is probably 70% desert-covered if ever they go there that will be a very different scenic and cultural experience than what they've encountered at all in the campaign thus far should be interesting no worries i'll do you one better (mccree voice) it's high noon (cheering) awesome that's great also a plug for a friend finding time to do more tips and tricks has been difficult i am trying to get into a new batch soon but at the same time a good friend of mine matt colville who is the writer of turtle rock has gone further than i ever could as far as outlining really detailed videos on worldbuilding and running a game and running encounters so if you're like oh i'm mad there's not more gm tips there's a guy who is doing a much better job than me who is doing a lot more than me go watch his shit his stuff sorry family panel but yeah matt colville go check out his videos they are really good anyway back to your question killing a player is always a difficult thing i have done it in a few games and it's not a fun experience but it is an interesting experience from a narrative standpoint d&d is a fantasy world and there are things that can reverse death in d&d sometimes it can be later in the game a little too easy to reverse death in my opinion that's why i introduced the skill challenge ritual for resurrection in my game take an element of the skill challenge from fourth edition that i liked and convert that to the idea that not every soul can be recovered whether they themselves accept their own death or whatever entity holds sway over their immortal soul takes them before the ritual can that's kind of the challenge in that ritual the players their actions in that ritual essentially represent them trying to facilitate or reach out to their soul to stay and to come back to the body but every single time i've had to kill a player it's hard because this person has put so much energy and time into this and you are essentially not robbing them of it but circumstantially they're losing it and you have to be the person to agree to it and tell them they're gone and it sucks and it's hard and people go home sometimes crying and you're like what have i done (laughter) and it was like what are you gonna do welcome to the shadowfell (laughter) hi jeremy with a toe in suicidal i-- unless they make real some serious mistakes here's the thing for a tpk to happen they have to not be able to acknowledge their mortality most tpks happen in games because the players are assuming they're going to win or they're just not being careful if we keep fighting and keep fighting-- oh god he's down too i know if i keep fighting-- i'm the only left if i keep fighting-- we're dead you know then yeah it's going to happen like shawn-- that could have been a total tpk if his character wasn't like okay we're not going to win this any chance we have of recovering this party some of us have to get out of here alive run as long as somebody does that there are opportunities to try and retrieve a few of those people you know because of resurrection magic and such and there's always the wish spell you can always quest down the road part of an adventure for a while could be to find a way to find a being of enough power to be able to wish a friend back to life that's a classic fantasy trope and that's a really worthwhile journey that's-- go to the underworld to seek a friend and bring them back that's as old as there's been written word that's old gilgamesh days in greek mythology yeah so (pause) i forgot the question (laughter) i think they have about a year of story left before they finish the biggest arc of the story the next step beyond the chroma conclave because that's-- thordak the cinder king i expect him to be probably around level 17 or 18 when they get to that maybe earlier depending on how brash they are how careful they are but there's other things brewing in the world of exandria i don't know what that's about put all the survivors on top of it what could possibly go wrong don't tell them about the marble just a failed ritual have you ever seen that scene in a clockwork orange with the-- (laughter) aside from that it's the way-- you've got to explain it whenever anybody says what is dungeons & dragons like when you asked me at the beginning what is dungeons & dragons i'm like uhh it's communal storytelling and improv in a fantasy setting it's like lord of the rings but you're just making it up as you go what would you as an outsider coming in originally what do you think would be the best way to describe it to you if that's not it you're welcome if that doesn't work send them to me (laughter) audience come do it audience yeah man seeming an entire party into cows to try and masquerade as-- and to a certain extent interrogate cows as cows varying sized cows seeming messes everything up i'm going to keep putting this out there i love it i love it then having to chase down a roc so cast fly on the cows so you have a party of different-sized flying cows across the moonlight it's everything you hoped amgen would have produced (laughter) i know i know he had it coming not very well for him his bard character was a vistani and was this very somewhat slimy charismatic in that i-can't-possibly-trust-you ringmaster-y kind of way eventually he just got fed up with it and the corruption had set in so strongly he just cut his tongue out jack played it as this now freaked-out and then subservient quiet and-- yes he would express his stuff through character action and describing what he was doing emotionally but couldn't actually say it so it would be like i bow my head and nod and look directly in his eyes and give him a look of intense hatred but then look away and walk and i'm like all right (laughter) yeah in a lot of games if one player had cut out another player's tongue that would have been a really tense angry-- real people being angry like he can't do that that's bullcrap you know maybe or you could take it as a really interesting character moment the way jack did and play it into the personality and now that's a reason for the mute character to be silently plotting against the person who did it or try to find a way to get their tongue back and their comeuppance against that player that in itself can be a really cool arc as well i don't promote pvp in your games unless your players are really into the idea and respectful of continuing the narrative because that can go really south very quickly if you're not being mature about it but yeah that's one of the weirder ones audience awesome that's awesome hello audience good strong name (laughter) audience awesome audience okay that's what i like about ones and 20s while in the system technically in d&d rolling a 20 on a skill check is isn't considered a critical success necessarily i consider that just lowering the dc on the skill check because i think a 20 should be magical whenever it's rolled i think that number is so intrinsically wonderful when you see it on the table that to roll that for a skill check and have it not really be just a high number i think that robs you of that moment so i do give some sort of benefit like if grog rolled a 20 on an intelligence check a few times that doesn't mean he suddenly has an encyclopedia in his head or that he knows exactly what he's trying to find out but i'll give him a little bit of information he otherwise might not have known whether it be just an instinct or something he remembered he's like oh yeah you can find ways to work it into a game but there have been a number of encounters that have been steamrolled by a series of 20s you guys watched percy's crazy 20-a-thon butt flap orc death 2015 that's going to be a bumper sticker by the way that whole phrase (laughter) scanlan and kaylie that was one of those natural ones-- when scanlan's history caught up to him and she was there to kill him or at least cut him down to the point where he would understand the pain that she went through through his speech and she rolled a straight one-- those are those perfect narrative moments they don't work out often but every now and then you get that moment where it would be perfect if i had critically succeeded or critically failed at this moment and then it happens that's the magic of the game for me those are the moments you remember forever audience yeah good job guys that's a whole questline you'll never touch again thank you hello my biggest recommendation is start small if you're doing homebrew if you're making your own world start small if you're running a pre-made adventure or module it can be a little easier especially for your first time because a lot of the information is already provided for you but if you're creating your own story start small you get stuck in this world-building aspect of trying to build a whole continent a whole culture-- multicultures and political structure between these two sides and all of a sudden your party is like we're going to spend the next six months in this city you're like but i built all this okay so start on that city build a small town or a small farm village or wherever you want them to start and just focus on fleshing out that small area consider the major npcs who they interact with positively or negatively what's the antagonistic force in that area that's going to be driving the story what type of character intrigue can you input in this small little cluster of people and then once they start playing it their decisions will begin to inform your worldbuilding how they interact with these people what kind of things that their characters are interested in finding in the story will inform you of what kind of things you can put into the world down the road that will really hook them and get them interested in the story as they progress so start small have some big ideas and take notes on things you would like to build in the long run but don't overwork yourself creating everything at once and have only this much be seen for a year that's my biggest recommendation because all of that effort you put into a smaller area will make that small area so much more fleshed out and lively and real in their minds and really give you the dm the confidence of knowing that whatever they do in this little area you have a really strong idea of where it might go and how you can react to their decisions that's my biggest recommendation no worries other than killing a player killing my city of emon man building a town over two and a half three years and having it be like a central location to the story and the characters' world and where they live and everyone they love lives for the most part and it's the political center and then having to because it was the narrative i built where the world was going and where the story needed to be come in and just smash it just kick all my legos over oh it was fun weirdly cathartic you're welcome in a stomp my own sandcastle kind of way basically hello hey sean sure i'm not going to be able to quote things exactly from memory but something along the lines of okay i'm going to focus on the poop in a jar what can i see around me that's one (laughter) yes i don't know as far as i know from the game i don't think it's multiplayer but i think they're making it a little more open world like you can wander around the map it's not like final fantasy x where you had an airship and you pick places and it drops you down there i think it's a little more open world wandering from what i've seen in the trailers but it's not multiplayer like xiv is if that's what your question means as far as i know but when i find out i'll let you know i promise thanks buddy we can do this we can do this audience awesome audience i feel your pain (laughter) audience a general sliding scale i go for because-- adding just more hit points means it can go on for a long time for scaling so i mean adding more hit points does help to have enemies have longevity especially when you have that many players because that's a lot of damage that can be dished out in a combat round my recommendation is to also increase the damage that can be done by these creatures because you'll get fewer rounds of combat with more players but to still keep it dangerous have the damage they take from certain attacks be large enough to the point where it really is dangerous or conversely consider adding abilities to certain creatures that are area of effect attacks you can customize any monster they come across the monster manual are just templates and suggestions of how to run these things you can customize however you want so if you want that beholder to be really nasty against nine players perhaps it has an eye wipe ability that chooses to do one eye ray attack on everything within a 20 foot radius how will that do against nine players audience i'm just saying there are ways you can customize creatures to be more of a threat to multiple entities and yeah because a lot of single target attacks will be less effective against larger groups think of ways that you can give them big sweeping attacks that can hit multiple guys at once or things that can lock down and grapple multiple players at a distance and make them ineffective for a round or two like those are ways you can still make it threatening for that many players without having to just give them 400 more hit points and it becomes a huge slog fest audience one more one more hi megan most influential for your character while you think about that for keyleth i know marisha for her it was partially avatar the last airbender she's a huge fan of the series so when she created a druid she wanted to go that elemental trying to learn to master different tribes of elemental types which has been kind of a cool journey for her character also because marisha as you may have noticed she's a tough chick she's like really confident and that's why i like her you know she's the fighter i'm the diplomat it works out fine she defends my honor (laughter) hey we all are in many ways i think we can all agree on that thank you so sorry if we didn't get to your question if you see us around the convention feel free to stop us and ask or come to another panel or come to our signing and ask us or shoot me a message on twitter thank you guys so much
