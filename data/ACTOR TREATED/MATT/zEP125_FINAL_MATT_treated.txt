critical role theme] for those who are unaware ashley just full-on ripcorded out of halfway-a-phrase and it was beautiful it was adorable so-- it's all good so last we left off the mighty nein have been making their rounds in the city of zadash seeking opportunities information getting their bearings amongst the various townsfolk streets and what goings-on there are getting updates from town criers wandering through the roads speaking with individuals going into bathhouses where you met up with your fantastic long-lost barbarian yasha coming in to join alongside you guys in your exploits you managed to converse with a meeting or at least beau and fjord met with a meeting of unhappy denizens of the empire discussing their frustrations beneath the leaky tap and had crossed some information with them you had gone and made some purchases you had sold off a few of the things you had acquired in your journeys northward along the amber road you had decided to looking for work go to the king's hall where they had a task board there and had taken one of the contracts that had been posted you would be paid to seek the sewers beneath the city near the outskirts of the tri-spire area of the town for something that had been lurking within those tunnels below a couple of guards had not returned one had gone there and fled you were promised a sum of money should you be able to exterminate whatever this entity is and bring back proof of its demise you jauntily accepted this before this happened as a part of a journey towards this tri-spire both caleb and jester made their way there caleb unsuccessfully entering a nicer district of the city that did not seem to believe or respect his presentation jester did so she got a room at one of the hoity-toity inns in the district and was led to some mild disappointments where we left off the two of you had reconvened and begun making your way back to meet up with the rest of your friends at the leaky tap tavern probably at a brief distance from each other as caleb has huffed off in a bit of frustration eventually caleb you make your way to the familiar outside of the leaky tap you enter the fresh mud now a little bit less fresh and dried against your face into the interior at this point it's mid-afternoon there's maybe about let's say nine patrons in there and a number of your friends who have been waiting for the two of you to return that are all sitting around a table and discussing amongst themselves the rest of you guys look across and watch caleb enter and then a few moments after jester enters as well make a perception check 11 you look around the room and nothing seems to apparate the clientele all seem disinterested with your presence there's nothing that would belie any arrival of an entity she spoke of you do from port damali to the southern gates of the empire and the wuyun gorge on foot-- which you guys were traveling on foot-- it took you about the better part of two weeks you passed through nicodranas-- or you didn't pass through nicodranas but you went through along the road and skirted along the side you took the road pretty much straight there but it was quite a bit of travel on foot to get there no i believe it was trostenwald it's a very intricate key it feels like a dense iron but it's been gold leafed or coated in some sort of reflective gold-like metal it's very well made it has little scrawlings on it almost like a spiral in the center the key itself-- --is probably worth a silver in its own right okay good to know you turn back at the three-piece half-elven band that are moseying their way through the afternoon lazily they're whispering and chatting amongst each other and ribbing each other with their elbows between things half-paying attention to the music but it's nice enough to keep atmosphere as the coin clinks and rolls about two feet off the gentleman standing with this double set of drums that lays over a leather strap on him-- you can see he's got the shaved sides of his head this young half-elven boy-- immediately sees that stops drumming grabs the coin gives you a nod and goes right back into the song you watch as the other performers all of a sudden immediately look to you and they're all like-- so he's steve martin in the jerk yeah (laughter) later afternoon which guy yeah you don't know anything you can go back and try and ask for information on that but you haven't met him or know anything from where you are now it'd take you maybe the better part of 45 minutes better part of an hour it's late afternoon you're probably about an hour and a half two hours from sundown do keep in mind and this is my fault too for not keeping track of it but even with darkvision you're still seeing pretty low light long-distance perception checks without light you're still at disadvantage on them i've been bad about keeping track of that so you can turn things into torches (laughs) everyone looks at their equipment suddenly well all righty what's the plan you do you have a handaxe are you guys making your way towards that direction okay fair enough make an investigation check for you as you guys travel and traverse the city yeah along the way and keeping an eye out asking a couple questions here and there you eventually find a very basic clothingwears company nothing fancy but just utility pants worker's shirts gloves and cloaks are available so if you want to buy a cloak you can do that not in this one no your choices are pretty much brown black and gray so you're good you're good on that one i do not recall if they had any pricing put down for cloaks 600 gold pieces please eh it falls under what would be general common clothes so i'll put the cloak cost at two silver exactly the further north you go yeah this particular area is pretty chilly especially since you're getting towards the end of fall it's almost harvest close in two weeks you guys are hitting winter in the very near future you would know this too that snowfall is fairly common throughout the winter here for both of those together one silver piece perfect following that the task board contract that you recovered and was assigned to you by the herald of the hall contains both the writ of lawmaster intent which is what will give you approval to travel into the sewer without being harried by the crownsguard and also gives you the location of the sewer that leads you there following the basic instructions and asking around you eventually find yourselves at the corner of ruen road and dewmist yeah r-u-e-n as you approach this intersection largely still cobblestone a few that are missing and the dust has sift pockets to make it soft the sky is still light but you can see the sun just beginning to crest past the near walls and familiar to the two of you you guys are maybe two blocks away from the outer wall of the tri-spires at the intersection there are two crownsguard that are stationed there that are keeping eyes and watching around off to the eastern side of that intersection behind one of the poles that contain the lanterns that are lit at night you can see the cover that leads into the sewer below it's less of a sewer or manhole cover but there's an open drain and a latch and a small metal pole that prevents anyone from going into it make a perception check you don't see anything dangerous georgie as you begin to spend time staring through the grate and start deciding how to get into there one of the crownsguard stationed walks up and approaches quickly and goes excuse me can i ask you what you're doing here i've heard a few things it's a-- apparently there's something down there that's been real scary and-- i'm not fucking going down there you kidding me i only know what i've heard no i can open the grate i wasn't meaning to put words in-- he scratches his head over his helmet and doesn't realize he's not getting to the itch all i know is that apparently they lost a couple of guys down there and-- one of them was pissing himself and ran well be my guest he pulls a key off of a ring and goes down to the latch on the metal bar that blocks off the entry and pulls it open i don't fucking know there's a lot of them around here they never recovered the body well you're welcome to go down there and continue yes to prevent folks from wandering into them well i'm stationed here for the next several hours so as long as you return-- to this one you'll be fine well start shouting keep that writ on hand and if there's any crownsguard that hear you they'll probably be able to let you out i'm going to be honest i haven't been down there it smells real bad i don't think so we haven't had any heavy rainfall i haven't been able to hear more than a trickle down there for a number of weeks nothing i've heard no i understand there's seven of you he looks genuinely overwhelmed by all the information and goes good luck and yell if you need something (throat clearing) he pulls the rest of the bar open and you guys have this space about a foot and a half yasha as you climb down immediately it drops and your foot finds a rung there's a metallic bar that acts as a ladder as you begin to lower yourself down you can look to your left and right and what little bit of daylight is coming through helps fill out some of the interior you can see what looks to be maybe 15 or so feet across from side to side 15 to 20 feet from this wall to the other slick stones a slight curvature that leads into a base where there is a small ditch or a basin where old liquid is trickling through there is a mild decline heading away from the direction you are and a mild incline heading in the direction of the tri-spires the smell is not pleasant but you're a tough chick it's never been an issue so you get yourself down and it's no more than ten feet to climb to the base of this at the moment you see from this spot where you've climbed down the ceiling drops low to about ten or so feet you're probably about 15 or 20 feet below the surface now your torch lights and the bright space begins to open up from side to side make a perception check spoke too soon yeah you don't have to you all eventually down into the sewer grate and then you hear the (metal scraping) (click) and the metal bar up top is closed make an investigation check looking at right near the base of where the rungs are it looks like there are arrows that point each direction the arrow to the right which leads upward splits into three additional arrows it's just a continuous arrow shh don't spoil it you guys begin to head southward it's a very faint decline you can only tell it's a decline in the sense that if you look right or left you can see the water is trickling in the direction you're traveling the tunnel continues for about 100 feet or so before it curves slightly to the right and then comes to another set of rungs and another sewer-top access yes that was the only notable element of what you were looking for perception check no sense of webbing no at the moment you don't see anything moving no make an investigation check if you want to you get down and look about and you don't see any tracks by any means but you notice that near where the water is-- and it's a faint trickle of water the stream is about that wide and you barely hear it moving past you see elements of sludge that has slowly congealed over time along the edges of this groove that guides the liquid and you can see bits are pushed like something had moved through in the direction of where you were but that's it angled like something slid and pushed through the water in the direction you came from about four inches yeah you see one or two that slide out make an intelligence check it's a combination of things your alchemical history and heightened goblin senses for waste product there's hints of excrement no no no no all right um-- stop it sam okay there's a hint of an iron aftertaste something oxidizing somewhere in the water or the water itself a faint hint of sulphur from the water and things breaking down in the water nothing that catches your immediate attention except for -- oh my god she's no longer roleplaying because you rolled so high that faint iron aftertaste is familiar it reminds you of when you've licked a wound or bit your lip it's very faint because you rolled that high you're like hmm so what are you guys doing correct or continues on the direction you were traveling looking at that set of rungs you can see the arrows that are still marked there there's a singular arrow that goes in the direction where you came from and the other arrow splits into two you get the sense that each of these indicates where the next if you continue that way if it's going to divide or be straight part of this network of sewers that have been built below zadash long ago you were heading down and the water's trickling in that direction you guys continue back to where you were and traverse instead upwards you guys had paid a little bit of attention when you were traveling towards the tri-spire but the entire city is not level there are grades to it it was built over hilly terrain as most of this valley itself has all sorts of varying heights of hills and clusters of hills the tri-spire is up on a raised hill within the city's construct so as you ascend in the direction of the tri-spire you get the sense that you're not ascending too terribly much but you're now just about underneath where the wall was as it curves around a bit you look ahead as yasha's holding out her torch and you can see a t-intersection of the sewer where it continues on straight or heads to the right or to the left you also see more of those clusters of built-up refuse that have created small masses in the ground where the water is pooling and making its way around yeah you can yeah and while the floor itself-- the walls gradually come in and become a bit of a level platform and then descend into the ditch where the water is traversing the ceiling is a continued curvature of it it's almost like a tube make a perception check you make an investigation check you see a very faint barely shifting piece of thin silk cheese cloth-like material that is barely visible on the cusp of the torchlight on the right-hand side of that intersection as we continue from this point guys i want to know what your marching order is as you're traversing forward right we have caleb at the back nott you're in the middle with them jester where are you there we go so you go up and inspect the web you guys head up with the torch you come into the intersection the water is coming down from the path in front of you directly across the left-hand tunnel continues for about 40 or 50 feet before it curves off and goes upward again almost a parallel path there's water trickling down there that's all meeting here to the right where this webbing is there is no water it is a dry ditch sure you bring the torch to the webbing and watch as it burns away in a few seconds and turns to ash and dust there's also a very faint scratching sound you activate one of them as it lights up you bring the torch around to look as the armor filters up onto you the weird warm humid air of the sewer interior seems to crystallize against your armor the ice that normally gives a translucent bluish-white color has a strangely yellow-green tint to it okay you take a quick swig you guys look out in the distant tunnels and you see nothing it's funny as you glance down at the ground though one of those small clusters of refuse shifts a little bit and shifts again i say little it's a few feet across they've gotten larger as you've progressed on there's a bunch up in the hall around you right now as you throw the ball bearing and it hits some of it breaks away and you see horrible matted fur there's a flash in the torchlight where you see two eyes reflect through and you hear this sound (shriek) you watch as fangs open up and a bunch of the other clusters of gathered refuse all suddenly begin to shift and skitter in your direction i need you all to roll initiative we had you guys up here all righty all of these sewer-faring giant rats begin to rush towards you their fur seems to have over time merged with other bits of discarded debris and matter causing this outer shell of broken garbage trash and excrement that protects them and gives this look of a horrible half-burned pile of compost with teeth and fur rushing in your direction on that note for initiative here guys let's start with 25 to 20 anyone oh damn you rolled a natural 20 what's your initiative oh that's right we have nott and fjord 20 to 15 15 to 10 10 to five molly what was yours all righty it's fine it doesn't matter in the order at the top all of them start rushing in their eyes glaring as they shift past the torch that yasha's holding there's probably six maybe seven in the vicinity at a quick glance around you and they're all rushing in your direction nott and fjord you guys are up first at the moment you don't see any you can that rat there gets an attack of opportunity as you swipe out of its range first that is going to be a 15 actually not bad that hits as it snaps out at you you take five points of piercing damage as it bites out you feel its teeth sink into the back of your calf muscle through the armor and into the back of the thick running muscle the pain strikes through you you yank your foot away and you feel something tear you can feel the blood running down the back of your leg and inside your boot as you feel the pounding of the very dirty bite that it's left in the back of your leg as you pull away from it the pounding pain of your leg is also accompanied by the sudden sound of a rat shattering into ice pieces against the ground and disintegrating as it bites and sinks its teeth into you the thing suddenly crusts over with a similar type of strange yellowish-green ice before it t-1000 shatters across the floor of the inside of the sewer continuing your round in one sweep an empty hand apparates and water springs out from the grasp as it slams down go ahead and roll for an attack a 14 hits you can roll damage as you sweep down you completely bisect the rat with your blade it screams out in this loud heavy horrible monstrous squeak you're not used to hearing what normally is a small rodent sound but amplified from a larger bulbous mutated form that it now has as you impact you see it cut in half it releases this putrid cloud of whatever gases its body holds in it i need you to make a constitution saving throw please you manage to hold your breath and back out of it as it dissipates around you that finishes your turn correct there's one right there each one of these is considered one spot between you right there okay go for it roll for attack that hits go ahead and roll damage it rears back and goes to leap in the air towards molly's face it gets maybe two inches off the ground before your bolt sinks right through its skull emerges on the other side and it spins in the air the momentum of its leap striking the momentum of your bolt and there's a spray of blood in the air this noxious cloud of gas emerges from the wound that's left in the side of its throat i need molly beau and yasha to make constitution saving throws please it's like popping a balloon it (explosion) they seem based on the bacteria and whatever they've been living in to be carrying a large amount of this gas in their body what'd you get molly you pull away for the moment and put your coat over the front and block it the two of you unintentionally it gets into your nose it stings your eyes you both take three points of poison damage finished your turn nott beau you're up as you're coughing it's stinging all of your senses and you right yourself and prepare for your turn that hits go ahead and roll damage eight damage angrily in response to this you sweep down with a giant golf swing of your staff and as it hits it impacts bludgeons the side of its body it gets slammed hits the wall and falls to the ground some of the gas seeps out of its body but it isn't exposed it is dead but the method of damage delivery seemingly didn't disturb whatever was contained within its body over which one jesus you rush up and critically kick this rat in the side of its body wham you feel breaks and bones or might be sticks might be whatever else has created this shell of debris about its body it gives this screeching sound as falls over onto its side and then gets back in its place it's hurting it's barely holding itself in place but it's angry and ready to snap back at you and it is yasha's turn actually no those are all rats i didn't have as many rat minis for this use your imagination you get the idea you have enough movement to get to any of those over here one two three okay go for it make an attack roll sam and yasha the rat puncher you're not raging right it's just a regular attack that hits so it takes one point of damage plus whatever your strength modifier is yep well it's one point and then she adds her strength modifier to it so four yeah so it takes four points of damage as you bludgeon it you hold the sword with one hand-- or your sword's probably still sheathed at this point you're holding the torch in one hand so you rush up and fist-punch it it's not a light weapon it's not a weapon you can off-hit with it you could've if that was your action but you've already punched it however you did straight up rush up and cold-cock deck a sewer rat in the face once again you feel the crunching right behind it as it falls over and gets back up its jaw's hanging off to one side and it has this horrible gurgling sound as it screams at you a combination of this reddish blood and whatever putrid green liquid is mixing and pouring out of its mouth okay that ends your turn then right all right it's now their turn this one is going to shift around painfully limping to get down and try to bite out towards your legs this one's going to move still in combat with you and go after-- actually no because you punched it it's going to continue after you this one is going to come after you as well since you rushed up in its way so the one coming after beau that is going to be a 15 misses you duck out of the way the two against you is a 16 that hits all right and a 17 both hit so you take from that first one six points of piercing damage as it leaps up and actually-- you're not raging yeah that's resistance from the rage that's okay you can use a bonus action on your turn to rage if you want to it's okay so you take six points of piercing damage as it bites up and you put your arm in the way and it clamps onto your forearm it begins tearing you shove it off and it lands onto the ground spins and gets back to its feet the other one you take four points of piercing damage as you shove that one off the other one leaps onto your back and begins snapping at the back of your neck and shoulders and you shove it back onto the ground and it readies itself for another strike as they're slowly swarming around you ending their turn now jester you're up go for it this is the one that's already been punched too so you rush up with your handaxe and swing go and make an attack roll yeah that hits go and roll damage seven points of damage the rat that's face is already broken even when it managed to bite towards yasha earlier it was mostly dragging its top fangs across the side of her forearm as its jaw would not actually snap shut you finish the blow by taking the axe swiping down as you do you carve into its body and a cloud of poison dissipates from its torso area i need yasha caleb and you jester to make constitution saving throws please okay you manage to hold yourself off not being taken into it a second time five points of poison damage to you as you accidentally inhale a spray of it into your face you're like (gasping) five you also take five points of poison damage that end your turn jester okay so you finish coughing okay then molly you're up go for it which one are you going up to the one that beau kicked earlier okay go for it roll a d20 and add your strength bonus 12 just hits you deal one point of damage to that one as you reach down and sock it in the head-- go for it well are you attacking with your-- you have two attacks with the light weapon on the side technically eh i'll allow it it's fine go for it okay so it takes two points of damage so now you guys are rat punching you guys are going through and punching the fuck out of rats repeatedly decking the face-- your knuckles are bleeding a little bit it's not really enough to damage you but as you're punching down you're hitting slick oiled fur and jagged points of broken wood and whatever else has jammed itself into its matted fur but you've managed to hit it a couple of times and it's taken a little bit of damage but it's still like (snarls) it looks very cornered and lashing out now that ends your turn molly caleb you're up by yasha go for it roll for the attack 13 hits go and roll damage on the fire bolt it's a d10 right five between the punches you gave it that's enough to finish it (cheering) there is one more over here that's limping next to beau go for it 18 hits roll damage yep how do you want to do this okay as you turn around the side of caleb putting your second bolt in spinning around firing it strikes the side of it and where you hit it in the side there's this large pocket of stretched rat skin where it's pulled so far that the fur itself is disparate and you can see the peach flesh beneath the fur as it hits it (explosion) it's a combination of force from both the blow of the bolt and the propulsion of the release of gas that sprays right in the direction of beau i need you to make another constitution saving throw please that's okay you only take one point of poison damage i rolled really low for that one you take one point of poison damage i'll leave this here as a visual aid sure this is the direction you guys had come in from so the liquid is traveling down this way and then down this way and there is no liquid from the side and the web that you had destroyed is up in this corner you're going to go in this direction in comparison to some of the scents you've encountered in this conflict suddenly the rest of the sewer doesn't smell as bad yeah okay as you push through one of the open wounds from one of the ones that was cut through by either jester or fjord i'd say about a third of the body mass is an assembled shell of refuse the interior of it appears to be rat or animal-like general array of organs though a lot of them have a colorless gray or beige appearance to them and a lot of them look to be in various stages of necrosis and there's a lot of infection inside travis and yeah it's pretty nasty you can go ahead and make an intelligence check with advantage nine taliesin travis laura and you would know enough from the knowledge that you have that while there is necrosis in there it doesn't look like its fully in there these things are-- or at least they were alive up until a moment ago these infections when they continued for a period of time probably not for long to the right okay you do get a glance with your torchlight yasha as you glance up the path across the way and the path that curves around the side and you do see a few other similar collections though not moving or not reacting to the vicinity of where you are even glancing at the ones who were fighting you you can see upon closer look that their eyes are snowblind or infected to the point where they were very nearsighted or close to blind the patches in the distance you can see aren't reacting you your presence no you're going that way (laughs) i'd like you to all roll stealth checks please i'll let it happen usually you have to give that before they roll so you don't know it's fine 15 is better okay as you guys continue down the right pathway you continue further and find the clusters of makeshift bits of discarded material begin to give way as about 20 feet ahead of you the torchlight begins to refract and reflect against some sort of soft material that is drifting and enclosing a portion of the walkway you see ahead of you a majority of the tunnel is currently blocked other than a small path on the right side of it by a dense webbing of some kind you see a large knot or a-- not a nott a knot of webbing as well that is held aloft a foot off the ground make a perception check 15 it does not appear to be moving possibly insectoids this would not be technically an insect i mean it's webbing there are many creatures in nature that use webbing in different forms and types yes there's that too glancing at this the mass that is encased in the webbing is about this big it's about dog-sized it's about 20 feet ahead of you make a perception check with disadvantage because it does go beyond the torch threshold that one does not no looking past you can see layers of webbing continue for about what you can see 20 feet beyond that it looks to be an even heavier wall of it behind that completely blocks continued access into that chamber you can see two other much larger clusters of webbing that are wrapped around something you can get to it yeah there's bits of it that are drifting below you see that it does shift every now and then it looks like there's some sort of a breeze coming through faint as it is that's why from the webbing that is currently held aloft between the ceiling and the floor and the left wall from your perspective the first one you see every now and then you see it faintly shift as if a breeze or water moves through to get to this one no you can okay is this the one with your activated rite and the rite you activated was the rite of the dawn as his scimitar which is now glowing with this faint radiant light energy it almost burns through as you carve through slowly it's not an easy cut but you do carve through as you do the webbing begins to curl back and blacken at the edges as it pulls away you see something furry and fleshy as you pull it back a few more inches you watch as a rat head lolls out a tongue falling out the side it looks to be dry it looks to be bereft of any sort of internal liquid or life well it does not appear it's unseen but you sense its presence arrive on the dry dust-covered floor of this interior part of the sewer where the temperature has dropped and is a little less humid in this area there are two small plumes of dust on the ground and you sense the servant has arrived okay you put your hand forward and it's like hitting the back of someone's back but there's nothing there and it catches you off guard you're like what the heck it feels somewhat amorphous like a heavy wind pushback for a second but there's no wind and there's no whipping of force around your arm it's very strange all right schmidt goes past-- (laughter) right so the two of you approach the first barrier to see the second as schmidt approaches the second barrier one of the masses which does appear to be humanoid in size shakes slightly doesn't react the other one shakes slightly and you watch as an arm limply falls from the side of it some webbing tearing as it does you hear a metal sword clang to the ground you see a bracer that once belonged to a crownsguard the bracer (whoosh) and drifts on its own in your direction you're about ten feet from it they look pretty dead they're ten to 15 feet from you yeah do you have any specific order you want to maintain here all right all right caleb yasha and beau-- is it molly and fjord at the front of the other group okay so nott goes behind caleb and then we have fjord and molly on the other side with jester behind them okay you move around that barrier and get to the next ten to 15 feet up where there is the next larger barrier of webbing and the two unmoving humanoid forms wrapped up there okay they both impact and the bodies shift there's a burst of flame some of the webbing ignites and burns and curls away but it looks like the flame is so instantaneous it's not enough to immediately ignite the webbing there is a burnt mark on them and neither of the forms move or react to the impact and the web shifts and shakes for a moment before it eventually comes to rest again okay you do it a second time it burns a little more as the webbing burns away in that section you can see the crownsguard armor chestplate that is now a little bit charred beneath the impact they're all still in the back but you can move forward if you want to move forward okay okay you shift yourself 15 feet behind make a perception check so you can watch with disadvantage because unfortunately you're away from the torch light to do so so you're keeping watch (laughter) make an investigation check prodding around yeah there is from just a glance they both have coin purses on their belts folded into their belt as a protective measure they both look like they were caught in a state where they'd be willing to travel anywhere and spend money okay you being to pull from their bodies what are the rest of you guys doing glancing about as you inspect the bodies there's no identifying tag to them there isn't an elaborate system of maintaining crownsguard members or identifying that you've noticed at least make a medicine check sure easy enough to do they do they both are carrying a longsword they're well kept not used you look along the blade and there are barely any signs of indentation no but they are uniform design they're not elaborate or ornamental the crownsguard weaponry are all pretty much designed or provided by a similar blacksmithy technique so they all feel like they're uniform to a certain degree that's enough it's not too hard to see as you look over each of the two bodies both of them have heavy puncture marks either right in the back of the neck on one of them or the other one has it right under the front of the chin the puncture marks are about that wide about two inches across on each side where the skin and flesh has bubbled and pushed away from the side and they go very deep in make a perception check there would have been some general webbing towards the base of this but you've burned away that central area as you step forward you look beyond where that burning mark is and there is a stark left turn it curves to the left and looking around the side it curves again to the right maybe 20 feet beyond that and you see another webbing barrier where there looks to be three different figures you see now there is another figure that is not part of the webbing barrier but is just webbed to the wall right next to it unimpeded to the point it would be an issue no you feel a little bit of stickiness when you step around from general fallen bits of stray webbing strands and such but nothing that would impede your movement you can go try to either the one behind you or the one ahead to the one ahead okay you come forth to the web there in front of you to where the two other figures that are massed there they are both humanoid and you now look over at a close glance as a third one small looks to be another one of the rat creatures that is caught in there you carve through go ahead and make an attack roll roll damage for the handaxe seven okay you carve through and a large part tears through before your handaxe stops and you're like (grunts) can't push any more you try and pull back and as you do you pull your arm back and it gets ripped from your grasp and it's now stuck and folded and your handaxe is now wobbling in the web okay you begin to carve around it and pull it out and you eventually get it free but now there's a cluster of webbing around it almost like the world's worst cotton candy it's wrapped around the center of it but it's sticky (metal plinks) the metal hits the ground and makes a bit of a sound no but the metal still hits the ground you watch as the flames burn around it and free it it lights up the vicinity a little bit there's that wedge opening where you've cut in that webbing barrier and behind it you can see the entire floor of the next portion appears to have some sort of webbing layer around it and all the walls are covered in it across the way you can see rungs and the end of this portion of the drainage that leads up into where you can see the wind would be coming through and that faint bit of wind that's pushing through that's causing all the webs to shift is coming from what you can barely make out to be the faint bits of sunset light peeking through another exit a sewage exit just like the one that you came in you also see a number of other figures that are all webbed to the walls and encased within there make a perception check you can yeah you glance past in the distance it's too hard to see unfortunately because the torchlight is too far away well you're at the second web wall that's about 25 30 feet from you so it's beyond the torchlight of where you're standing it looks like it it goes to a dead end but it's all covered in webbing because of your rite you manage to carve through and you watch as the second web wall comes and folds to the end the bodies that are encased in it hitting the ground with heavy thuds you can see the other bodies that are webbed to the walls around on the inside you can see the end of this it is a giant web nest as you walk past the ground itself is sticky you can still move but you're hindered somewhat having to like pull through and it tugs at your feet you guys watch as webbing tears and builds on the bottom of her boots as she walks in okay you stop and look and you can see the faint outline of bodies that are webbed to the wall parts of the faces that are revealed that are gray and lifeless drained on the far wall you see a large cluster of webbing it looks like a mass of three or four bodies jammed together and you see one body that's right next to where the rungs are that is not as webbed as the others and there is color to the skin you see elements of a humanoid face a halfling it looks to be about halfling sized it is about a foot up off the ground webbed to the wall one arm is drifting out and part of the face and unconscious but is not gray and dead like the others and that's where we're going to take a break i know we'll come back on that it's because i want to make sure we all get to the bathroom including myself i have to pee like a fucking racehorse so yeah we'll pick up on the reveal of this non-dead

you from you guys all together it's about 25 feet 30 feet jester is a little bit closer make a perception check okay fjord you shift around to join nott in the back and you guys look off in that distance you see nothing in the darkness behind you who else is doing what you move forward next to caleb as well you guys are finding your feet sticking to the material of the floor webbing you approach you watch as the head of this halfling is pulled away from some of the webbing and lifted up it is male actually because you're still with yasha in the back make a perception check both of you it's low light beyond that so make a perception check with disadvantage you can make a straight perception check if you'd like you can if yasha comes closer but yasha has the only source of light the dancing lights appear in the air and begin to drift in help fill out the area your torch light still being this larger beacon of flame light in the space beau you glance ahead and can see as the chin is lifted a thick band of tattoos-- a thick band of tattoos that completely encompasses the neck to the point where what's exposed from beneath it's like black shapes and designs completely around of the halfling yeah did you roll a natural 20 your amazing monk-like sight they're not fresh they're not fresh you do not also there's this weird sense that creeps on nott and fjord as you're glancing forward and you both turn over your shoulder to see a massive pale white and blue arachnid creature legs spindling outward at a width of ten feet or more giant dripping fangs and beady red eyes a row of them glaring right at you as this (hiss) pincers open up it's right behind fjord and nott and it is striking you fjord as its first strike it's literally here that is going to be a 23 to hit you suffer seven points of piercing damage as its fangs snap right into your chest area do you still have ice armor on i also need you to make a constitution saving throw you feel venom pulse into your body your physicality however being somewhat sturdy manages to resist a large element of the poison that is suddenly thrust into your torso you take-- that's a terrible roll you take five points of poison damage nott you look up and see this thing as it digs its giant pincers and fangs into fjord's body and it pulls back and you watch it vanish and disappear i need you all to roll initiative the last place you saw this-- the last place you saw it was there before it disappeared right there these are all the bodies that have been webbed up initiative order for you guys please 25 to 20 nice all right jester's up front at 22 20 to 15 guys all righty that was ten to 15 ten to five beau and molly all righty and ten to five that's true the top of this round jester you're up first no well you hear like the reaction of pain and you glance over just in time to see this large monstrous spider body vanish in place nott is just-- oh do you have one there yes but it appears to have been moved since they used the table last time oh well it might have happened yeah where shall we place this okay we'll put it there it worries me that i get to unveil that and it's not around it's fine jester you use that as your bonus action to cast what are you using your action for sacred flame is a cantrip you can sure okay you watch as the large lollipop apparates in that space and you cast sacred flame it has no target to effect no there's no burst of flame the spell has no target the space all this area here where the webbing starts is considered rough terrain to move through so your speed is halved moving through that area okay so you back up onto the rocks and start pulling your feet out of the webbing as you do that ends your turn ending jester's turn caleb and fjord you guys are up i can say you can start to get into it it doesn't offer you any cover at the moment but you're in it right now he doesn't seem to be okay ending caleb's turn you are currently blurring and shifting nope currently no you can make a main attack roll (poof) it hits the stone wall behind it it's not there you get the sense that it's not apparently there that ends your turn that brings us to-- all right so-- there is a moment fjord as you back up after releasing your eldritch blast where it impacts the wall and you're like shit you hear this (whoosh) sound and look your right and it appears right next to you it lunges out towards you again that is eight points of piercing damage and i need you to make a constitution saving throw all right you take 15 points of poison damage as the fangs dig into the side of your torso you pull back and try and defend yourself and it pierces your leather armor in your torso it releases a huge burst of venom into your chest you feel your lungs and heart seize for a moment and you almost fall back that burning orcish rage from underneath gives you that last bit of inspiration to shrug off the poison and look back angrily and realize you are in deep shit all righty that ends its turn that brings us to beau and molly is it bothering you it's been bothering you this whole time laura bailey the kind of friend that tells you when you have a booger in your nose i really appreciate it you can certainly try go ahead and make an athletics check you are standing in webbing so it's being able to-- i will say yes i will give you the ability to leap through and land off to this side using your movement and avoid that ten feet and still manage to free yourself from the webbing so that was 15 feet of your movement used to leap yep let's give it a shot 25 you're not quite close enough no you have whatever monk abilities that you have you have eyes on it at the moment yes you start defending yourself preparing for its onslaught that brings me to molly's turn you're right there it rolls a natural 19 on its saving throw that's like three 19s in a row that it has rolled by the way well the last two i was using the golden snitch this one i used the black d20 it was gifted to me at the end of the last campaign you must invite the vampire in for it to cross the threshold (laughter) so molly you moved up there and you're still ten feet away from this creature all right so you're holding-- okay so you're holding your action in case it shows up within range to strike it okay good to know that finishes their turn yasha you're up what's your speed 30 feet (counting) just in range it spins around after molly screamed at it and it goes (snarling) you can see in your torch light as you're clutching it in your hand as you rush towards it you're going to have to drop that torch to grab your two-handed weapon you drop it on the ground and as it hits the ground the light flickers off of its eight red beady eyes it turns its fangs open towards you and you see the venom and bits of fjord blood dripping off of the end of it as you rush towards it all right you rage what are you doing go for it roll for attack 23 hits roll damage it's d12 for your greatsword plus whatever your strength-- oh the greatsword yeah d12 is greataxe 2d6 plus three plus whatever your rage damage bonus is which i think is two right yeah it's plus two it's plus five damage to whatever you roll yep 14 points of slashing damage it shrieks back it's hurt but it's still doing fine is that the end of your turn yeah got it nott you're up that hits roll damage you get sneak attack as it opens its mouth the firelight from the torch flickering in its horrible weirdly shaped spider-like mutated mouth open up where the pincers and the giant fangs are a bolt sinks into its throat and it starts shrieking backing up defensively the pain causing it to pull away from you that's a serious amount of damage okay make a stealth check good to know that finishes nott's turn jester you're up it really did stick to it five ten 15 there yes you see right where everyone is and where this creature is 5 10 15 20 it cannot quite get into range because yours can only move 20 feet i believe that's the case cure wounds is touch i believe there it is okay what's the-- well it needs to make a saving throw right that is an 11 i think your dc is 13 right yeah roll damage two points radiant damage hey it all helps a burst of radiant flame suddenly encompasses the front part of its body between the impact of the bolt the slashing from yasha and the blast it looks like it's starting to feel a moment of fight or flight that end your turn caleb fjord you're up it does have partial cover though because of the angle you're at (counting) that'll improve your sight there that unfortunately does not hit as it's reacting from the impacts it begins to rear back and as it does there's this one flash of light it seems like it notices its presence and gets really low and flat suddenly its whole body which is massive shrinks low to the sewer as it passes overhead it pops back up ready that ends your turn all righty it's now the spider's turn that's right i forgot yes you may you may make your three attacks with disadvantage because it's a ranged attack in immediate face-to-face range 11 misses the first one goes wide second strike goes wide again 16 does hit your first time using the glove you're not too sure how the aiming works and the first two go off to the side you're like shit shit (boom) the third one finally impacts roll damage for that eight points of fire damage plus does your hexblade's curse do anything on that don't you add your-- it's ten right (explosion) the second the scorching ray blast hits it as it's rearing upright now and as it lights up you can see the streaks of blue designs across its pale white body the flames impact and burn around the side it pulls back ready angrily back towards you that ends your turn it didn't happen it's trying to decide what is the biggest threat right now i'm going to roll for it between yasha and fjord it's going to go for yasha you watch as a vein pours out the side and the currently six intact red eyes of the spider all cloud over black with bits of trickling dark purplish blood pouring from the edges of them that gives it disadvantage which you are very lucky it is because that was a natural 20 that still comes to 16 does that hit you take from the fangs as it lurches towards you oof that's going to be 11 points of piercing damage yes because you're raging (cheering) as it lurches forward and slams its fangs in the collar bone area you having no real armor to protect it you take it head on the fangs sink and you feel the venom pulse through your torso through your arms the burning pains goes through and you flex it off as you do so thankfully reducing what would have been-- you only take 11 points of poison damage it now sees you all moving around it and it looks like it's been hurting you watch as its form vanishes yeah you watch as it vanishes from the space that's where you last saw it ending its turn beau and molly you're up you cannot make a bonus action attack on a held action so you cannot unfortunately make a flurry of blows i don't believe as a held action no unfortunately okay so you're holding your action until it appears into range good to know molly okay you step back and stumble over one of the crownsguard bodies that you left on the ground but you hold yourself there using it as one foot slightly elevated platform being at the ready you're holding your attack action that ends molly's go yasha you're up it appears to have vanished to there you can yeah as yasha backs up against the wall greatsword in one hand you watch as she puts her arm to her chest there's a faint glow of very faint whitish energy and her wounds heal up slightly that finishes your turn yasha well mage hand is an action to cast so you can't hold-- oh no with your legerdemain right oh it means once it's already out you can do that to use a bonus action but you have to get it out so you're holding your action there good to know top of the round jester you're up (counting) you can get up to him anything else you want to do move your spiritual weapon or anything okay so there no that ends your go jester caleb and fjord you're up 20 25 30 yes you can okay good to know that ends your turn caleb fjord what are you doing okay in case he comes into range good to know okay end of your turn last you saw it there you watch as there's a faint ripple in the air you just finishing healing fjord as he runs past you turn and smile and turn back just in time to see it not far from where it vanished appear right there it does get a surprise strike on you which has advantage disadvantage thanks to your last ability so it's just a straight attack roll that is a natural one that's okay it will use its movement to move down and go up the wall here if we went by those rules you guys would've been dead a long time ago all right so you do get an attack of opportunity on it as you swing past go ahead and make your strike with your somewhat web-covered-- right 17 hits by the way those of you that were in range to attack with that held action would've been just caleb and nott both of you guys get attack-- you were holding your attack you said you have to say what spell you're holding it's either i'm holding an attack or i'm holding a spell now you know seven damage nice a total of nein so (fwoosh) and as you throw your orb it skitters up the wall you almost hit it but it pulls out of the way before it shatters the orb splattering acid across the stonework burning through whatever outer layer of thick liquid has congealed there from where it appeared that would've been 40 feet from you yes you do goes wide no impact unfortunately that ends the spider's turn beau molly you're up it's above you on the wall i'll tell you what i'll give you the attack you'll have disadvantage and if you miss you're prone but i'll give you the attack if you want to there is a path that helps with that but not this thing all right you leap up to get your single attack on it with your bo go for it roll at a disadvantage that's pretty slick that hits roll damage 11 points of damage as you leap and smack it in the face it pulls up a little bit further away screeching at the impact it's looking pretty rough it's still around but that was not a positive hit for it i gave you the one you're technically just out of range that was part of the risk that end your turn molly yeah your spell dc would be eight plus your proficiency which is ten plus your wisdom modifier which is what three yeah that hits roll damage how do you want to do this (cheering) as you screech out this phrase in infernal-- as its legs begin to skitter upward and as it tries to escape up the top of the ceiling it loses its grip upon the top of the sewer ceiling it falls slamming on the ground next to beau and its legs begin to curl in as it's shaking you see blood pouring from wounds that weren't there before it seems the infernal itself has affected him physically from the inside it begins to curl its legs in deeper and deeper the sound of its guttural shrieking getting softer and softer-- there you go okay that's true so it is a large body the actual thorax of it okay easy enough to do it's legs are intact and they're sturdy enough you bring out whatever robe you have available and you start binding it and getting it in a position where it could probably be either on her staff or whatever else you have and carry over shoulders you guys approach the halfling still unconscious the arm draped out from the webbing it is very dark and there's still this torch left in the center there where yasha dropped it sure you grab the torch and you bring it over you get a close look there's the web mass in the corner there's the other bodies on the side the halfling looks to be injured in the sense that it looks like they took a blow to the head there's a slight bit of blood trickle along the hairline okay go ahead and roll for the hit points regained there there's a moment after you finish casting it where the halfling shakes the head what's going on you see one eye is almost still glued shut from webbing that's across the front of it but he's trying to open it i don't understand what's going on oh god (panicked breathing) he starts looking around looking up at the faint bit of light now which it's now just passing sunset you see a little bit of purple light coming through and through the little bits of webbing you can see the grate that leads outside he goes i don't know how i got here well i-- yeah i guess well i was just trying to get somewhere quickly make an insight check you see flames bursting at the side every time he flinches 18 i'm sorry i'm just-- oh god and he looks over and sees the other bodies on the wall and the webbing he's just (panicked screams) help me please help me okay he nods thank you back to you in halfling he's beginning to cut him free what did you say yeah well it's important when you're an ale hand you got to move product through the sewers quickly ale not a key but i-- i have a key you have to cut me free first thed thed sam marisha and i'll be happy to show you once you cut me free make an investigation check at a closer look too you can see he's got short spiky dark hair and a little bit of a goatee that's trimmed to a point at the end of the chin the tattoos all across the neck look like they're swirled serpentine shapes that all fold and knot together all across the throat from front to back like a giant dark band it's a tattoo yeah make an intelligence check yeah you don't okay you cut him free he's like (heavy breathing) you do find he's wearing some nice black/gray leather armor he has a pretty nasty-looking shortsword it's been altered to be jagged at the edge of the blade he has a small leather case that's tucked in the armor don't find a key he's free now as you cut him free and he's like (labored breaths) he stands up and he rights himself and checks everything and he looks to the left and goes um he points to the mass in the corner and you see the mass that's there it's not a series of bodies it looks like it's a slowly pulsing sac of some kind one of them (bursting) (skittering) with a torch throwing and landing and the sacred flame igniting it you watch as this cluster begins to burn as these tiny white and blue spiders begin to expand out the side some of them make it up the sides of the wall you rush up and like crush a couple of them even baby-sized they're about that big they're all coming up and they begin to burn you go and start burning it appears you've got them all some of them seem to have burned some of them seem to have vanished it's hard to tell if you go to the other bodies you get two sets of crownsguard armor and two longswords of the crownsguard right the total between those two was 15 gold 60 silver and 20 copper you do and you go through it'll take you a little while to go through all the bodies here so we'll get to see how many you get through here hmm well i believe it would because it is a volume/space thing it'll take up a lot of space within the-- and you have two two-foot by two-foot spaces on the two sides and then you have the main eight-foot cube section there so you do find another pair of studded leather armor that has like a sea motif to it there's shells pressed into it and a wave pattern on the edges the person it's attached to has a bunch of tattoos across their body as well that insinuate a lot of time at sea different names of different ships that are different points of faded on the body they may have been a sailor at some point in their life and has expired under here okay well the armor's a full set so it'll-- yeah i mean it's a leather chest plate leather arm bands and bracers and then leg plates as well so it's a full set you could probably fit all that into your bag if it's the only thing that's in your bag you stuff it all in there beyond that going through them for the sake of brevity here you find an additional 85 gold pieces 210 silver and 45 copper 210 silver and 45 copper yeah while you guys are all talking to this guy caleb is going from body to body putting everything in his pockets he's not being sneaky gold pieces 210 silver and 45 copper i know it's carried over well he's checked all his things and he goes okay i thank you all so much for your help i really appreciate it you've saved my life okay as he's doing this he smiles you can see he's missing two teeth to the side and he has a septum piercing up in his nose that he rights and pulls back down again so it's visible and he's like (sniff) all right yeah i'd happily pay you but your friend already took all my money that's what he's saying what-- if i can be of service i'd be happy to i don't know what you're talking about i apologize i don't-- i apologize i don't know what you're talking about make a persuasion check oh fuck he glances down at you looks taken aback and returns to you in thieves' cant and says and the rest of your compatriots switching back to common he goes look i cannot tell you anything except for if you want to find him there is a place you can inquire if i give you any more information and that gets around i am deader than that spider would have left me he sighs for a second there's a dive naught but five blocks from here called the evening nip don't say his name just walk up to the old man behind the counter and mention you'd like a drink and while you have no coin you'd be willing to offer many gifts 'many gifts' is the important part now i hope that's been of service and i-- as you seem to be the types who see it fit to save a person that you haven't met in the bottom of a terrible sewer i would hope that you would be kind enough to know that that information did not come from me and that you've never seen me before in your entire life as i haven't seen you either it's not very well done yeah no okay i mean--  he looks up behind him and says i've got mine but i need it for my work he glances over towards nott and says unless i'm mistaken it appears you have a female friend here who could probably help you get around that anyway anyway i bid you all adieu he pulls his hood up over his head and his little halfling feet quickly carry him back in the direction where you guys travel the sewer (distant yell) i'm aware no children one of them appears to be a woman in her 40s or so a lot of them appear to be dressed in heavy leathers they may have been either coming through to try to clear up parts of the sewer some of them look very poor and may have come down here in hopes of scavenging whatever had fallen down into the sewer and collected over time some of them appear to be similarly dressed as thed or at least have a somewhat skulking-type demeanor about their wares no there are a handful that look like they probably have traveled this route before and got caught up in it outside of the bodies it looks like there is broken bits of what would have been furniture or a cart at some time that got discarded or shoved down here from above other than that just the general refuse you've come across down here in the sewer yeah you see him make an investigation check on that okay looking about them and what you can rummage through he's pretty much naked other than his underoos looking through there's like the midnight lorry you don't recognize that name at all there's one of them that's the shell carrier don't recognize that one there's one name that catches your attention it was called the pink giver and it came through your ports at one point you remember it coming into port you were paid to take care of it offload things back on-- the name itself was derived by a wooden carving at the front bow of the ship that was of a mermaid with her arms extended that was gifting a human heart that was painted with this vibrant pink color that was its signifying visual yeah other than that nothing particular about it just that you were like oh yes i know that ship it's on the back it's almost universally spoken and as a language it's used for extended ciphers make an investigation check you can if you want to assist him you have advantage on it because she's helping you okay glancing about you can see behind the rungs there's about a two-inch gap across the wall there is a very very faint scratch into it that says although not referring directly to yours it says money pot yes which catches you off-guard because you're like that's one of our-- while this is happening what are you guys doing easy enough to do you have quite a collection going you guys have reconvened you've gathered your things the spider has been-- all the legs have been pulled up and wrapped and you have either beau's staff or something else to lift it with on both sides because it's pretty heavy it's going to take two of you to carry it would have to be you two it's pretty strong the two of you lift it so where are you guys going okay so who's going first as you climb up nott and look through the sun has set and the night has gone purple to dark navy blue as night has taken it you glance up through and you're looking out into a dark alleyway you see two sides of an alley shaded and dark about maybe 25 feet ahead it opens up into a fine cobblestone road you can see fine buildings across the way you see the lanterns are light in the center of the town you have not been to this part of the town but it's pretty well kept and no one seems to be immediately around to hear you it is locked go ahead and make a lock picking check no it's your thieves' tools so your proficiency bonus plus your dex bonus well two isn't it it'd be six 18 it takes a moment and you have to reach around the other side and it opens up and the bars push open the gap here into the back of this alleyway is about two feet tall each of you can get out comfortably that spider is going to need some squeezing you guys one by one get up back topside you manage to push it through it damages the body parts of it break and slide off it's not designed to fill through that space but it's still mostly intact not quite that bad but it definitely doesn't look as pretty on the other side so you all eventually gather up at the top street side it's completely dark the night sky is above you you can see the warm lantern light across the various street intersections and along the path in front of the various buildings you definitely recognize this jester this is indeed the tri-spires district it is night it is freshly night yeah it's sundown i'd say with the time it took you to scavenge the bodies about 30 or 40 minutes after the sun's set completely yeah probably i mean in this district shops are still open past sundown for a little bit but the later in the evening it gets many of them close down some shops stay open later you don't know so you remark it you close it you guys step out into the main street and you've traveled through here before you immediately think oh that's where the nearest exit gate in the direction of the hall would be you guys get about a block before two of the patrolling crownsguard stop and look at this troupe of people walking with a giant brutalized spider bright white and blue immediately jogs up both of them excuse me what are you doing here takes the writ and they both look at it the other one has his hand on the side of his blade each looking very closely at each of you and you are a motley lot going through all of you sneering a bit in the direction of caleb yeah a bit frightened at the vision of yasha and confused at the sight of mollymauk he finishes reading the writ okay very well but we will escort you to the gates and you can continue this on to the hall how did you get this in here looks back at the other guard and they share a brief glance right very well let us leave then they escort you towards the entrance the opening gate where you guys had passed through you move through and out into the interstead sprawl at the exact gates where you guys had entered or you had entered and you had attempted the night before i didn't well the nestled nook did you say he points over that way he goes to the south side of the silken terrace look for the small greenish hut-looking building they escort you out (laughs) get you quickly out of the district carrying a giant bloodied awful-looking spider as you're making your way some of the folks that are walking through start gasping at the sight and whispering to each other pointing some begin to approach and somebody else grabs their shoulder and pulls them back you become this slow-moving sight through this district all right you guys eventually make your way back to the hall so you're outside the king's hall as you approach some of the guards rush up to you and hail what do you carry and bring here to the-- what is this thing you bring him in some more of the guards begin to gather around and then voloshin is pulled from his interior office somewhere as he steps forward he says all right they tell me--oh goodness me that's a beastie he tugs on the end of his chin beard for a second so this is it this is the one (shouting) someone wake up cloen cloen and he was the one survived-- cloen clo-en he goes to the other guards go down there double check make sure everything is good go eventually you watch as another guard is brought in he has a night shirt on and he looks like he was woken up he's a little drowsy what's going on i-- oh that thing that's the thing he looks immediately scared he goes great send him back to bed well that's what we needed you look like just the person i would take advice from when it comes to administrating my people i'm impressed i will go ahead and retrieve your payments to the mighty seven laura and i'm sorry to hear that that's terrible make a deception check (laughter) he goes that's really too bad anyway i'll be right back that is property of the crown thank you very much if you would be as kind to remember these fallen soldiers who protect you and the people of this city by delivering unto us the armor and weaponry that they had been lost with i would be happy to go forward with delivering your reward two of the guards collect them he comes back they bring a small chest 700 gold pieces hand me the writ please thank you very much and i appreciate that and he sets it out and hands it to you so you seem able-bodied you've pulled through on something where few have been able to if you're looking for more work i'm sure we'll have things bit light at the moment but where can we find you if we're looking for you (laughing) of course you do leaky tap good to know all right now shove off well of course you do of course she does ah fair play now shove off as the herald turns and voloshin's there the guards gather the armor and the weapons and stuff okay good to know a voice comes through the hall and goes wait i'd like to meet them voloshin stops and goes of course lawmaster he steps back and from around the side of the hall from one of the doors on the left side of the building a human woman comes through in her early 60s once-brown hair has turned mostly gray and shoulder-length it's curled up a bit into a soft bob on the sides she's older her face is weathered and has seen some time she's wearing robes of gold and white but they seem to be not ceremonial or at least worn enough to the point where they look like they're worn for comfort she steps forward and she has these warm brown eyes that peek through this face sorry to bother all of you word just came to me that you were successful in taking care of this beast in the sewers i am lawmaster orentha and i just wanted to extend my thanks it's not often that folks are willing to go to lengths and put their lives on the line for the honor of those fallen of the crownsguard and those within the hall of the king so i just wanted to say i appreciate that the crown appreciates it the people of the city appreciate it and i appreciate it thank you she turns around and shuffles back into the hallway everyone goes about their business again and begins shoving you off towards the door what's the casting time on identify again you guys would be exiting the building just as you've finished that process you complete it take a moment to think it over and you hear them all exiting and talking to themselves as they're ribbing beau on the way out you quickly gather your things yup that was it thank you for watching you guys are back at the king's hall back in the interstead sprawl i thought i was pretty clear everyone else got it that's okay i know right now it's close to 830 900 it's still early evening-ish you guys easy enough find your way back to the leaky tap where you can utilize the washroom to get yourselves back to a personable state it's a darker gray but elements of where it's been pressed in with leather scrolling designed to look almost like waves curling on the outer parts of the different leather plates have a very faint turquoise inlay color on the inside that you can only see when it's directly lit it looks like a very beautiful set of leather armor there's no arms to it other than the bracer plates right there there's no sleeve there you go it's got an arm guard and a bracer there shoulder piece the torso portion a couple of plates that go over that and some leg guards what are you guys doing we'll say you got clean for the expediency of the story we don't have to roleplay through your bathing individually unless you really want to always stop me if you want to have a moment no you went back to the leaky tap this isn't medieval times in the fantasy world it's a weird mixture of different time periods and when i say they have a washroom i mean it's a basin with water that is replaced every couple hours that people communally come up and wash in it's not the cleanest water and it's probably been used by other people as well and if you bathe fully in it it might be changed before the next two or three people use it in your house they have one washroom for the multitude of rooms the entire tavern has and the water is changed every few hours maybe that's what i'm saying but it's functional okay go ahead and make a stealth check 15 would you have taken your stuff in with you molly would probably still be in the room you do make a perception check molly you watch as nott slowly creeps into the room heading over towards fjord's pack i mean all right you finish your baths you all convene down in the tavern yeah when you guys come down there and begin to reconvene about two tables away you see sitting alone with a tankard a familiar dwarven figure to both beau and fjord ulog who you had met before ulog with a g yeah you watch as you guys approach and as soon as you all gather at the table he gets up and walks over he seemed to be yeah he walks behind where fjord and beau are and goes don't mean to bother you but if i could have a moment of your time i'd like to talk excuse us he leads you guys back to where the cellar is you guys head back he nods over towards your dragonborn bartender gives him a nod walks past leads you down to the same cellar it's dark in there there's no light but he lights a hooded lantern as you enter and it gives this low mysterious atmosphere in the shadows as he spins around and goes i've been watching you a bit you're a curious lot more of you than came to the meeting five more did you-- and please be honest i'm good at telling otherwise-- did you reveal any of our sentiments to your-- of our moot to your companions went and saw you come back to town with this spider-beast you had on your shoulders now that's-- take it you're pretty good with a sword maybe with a bow experienced what's your skill sets if i might ask beyond just being curious that's a little strange not going to lie yeah understood curse upon ye who made that decision for you so you can move quickly without a ruckus you say and your friends do they share our sentiments (sighing) listen if you indeed have a heart for goodness in this world and you want to make a difference we're moving on to something soon that i think we could use your aid on you and your companions blast if you need payments i've got coin i can muster and i see you do work for coin i have few others of us who can chip in as well other than myself most of the knights of zadash are unskilled in the ways of the arm we're willing to raise a voice but not much of a fist or backing up a word with strength i'm willing to make it worth your time you don't have to answer now tomorrow at midnight me and a few others from the group the decision makers we're meeting back down here if you're in bring your friends we can all talk give you more information about what's going on and you can say yes or no at your leisure but i think we have a chance to really do something good in this city to change part of the status quo to root out some of the unworthy at the top think on it we're not against the empire it protects us there are good things about it what we're against are the people that abuse the system there are a handful in this town and their time is up your curiosity is piqued come by we'll talk well we've been talking for a very long time and there is a shift coming that we want to ride the wave of i'll let dolan tell you the details tomorrow anyway he snuffs the lantern good night all right you guys reconvene with the rest of the group you guys are in the tavern at the table but you're keeping your voices somewhat discreet no one seems to be paying immediate attention for the sake of brevity since it's getting late and i want us to get to a good ending point tonight they will let you in but nobody else it's not the same guards you met before and they take your key but they look towards the rather rough-looking large scary barbarian woman they look towards the very shifty-looking multicolored tiefling they look past the while he is wearing a cloak still rough grimy-looking wizard and they begin to fixate directly on the tiny green but white mask-skinned halfling creature thing in earmuffs that's squinting very hard and they begin to really pry in that direction before you start thinking this is not going to go well if i keep going-- you know one dive all righty let me pull this up real fast easy enough to find you head to another section of the interstead sprawl-- no you have not been you come to what is a small dark-wood rough and tumble dive bar with two very dangerous-looking guards at the outside you see these thicker human guys one who is completely bald pale skin big square chin that looks like it's been broken in multiple places who has his arms crossed the other one looks to be a spindly guy who's sitting there daggers sheathed on both sides and they both watch you as you enter and they both just stare yeah which is interesting because you expect for them to go through that it would be a really rowdy place but it's very quiet you walk inside and aside from the central candle-lit chandelier that is almost obtrusively laid from a low ceiling with a number of small booths that are built out of wood as well it has a classic old-england pub feel but everything smells of dried beers and ale and rotted wood you only see two other patrons in there that are at separate booths drinking alone and across the way you see this very very old dwarf with half of his beard burned away and this perpetual grimace he's sitting there looking out as you enter he perks up aye can i help you yeah if i can ask what you're celebrating that's a pretty good reason to celebrate drinks coming right up he goes and gets you guys a number of drinks the basest most bitter ale you've had but it's functional they call me clive clive bens and this is my bar pleasure as well never be too careful dangerous times riots breaking out in the cities in the empire folks coming through you got to be prepared don't want to be taken advantage of no but that's why i keep my front his eyes are locked in on you no it's just kind of creepy sorry just don't get a lot of your types in here pretty then don't start any finish your drinks enjoy he slips them out there's no conversation two people at separate booths that are drinking by themselves and they're all looking at you there's two other guys one of them is a younger plump human male has a tuft of a red and grey goatee at the end of his chin no hair on top of his head the other guy looks to be human as well he's older in his forties he glances over at you he's clutching a tankard and you can see he has a very familiar tattoo around his neck the tattoo it's not him but it's the tattoo yeah you don't know if it's directly the same but it's a similar tattoo to thed who you met earlier this place is maybe 20 feet by 30 feet it's very small the floor appears to be wood boards there are a couple doors that leave into a kitchen or storage area it's a tiny fucking dive you guys finish your terrible ale and you leave thanks for coming by have a good night you guys leave and the two guards watch you leave i'm thirsty and have been out of water and i keep going to drink nothing that's there i do it so much and i hate it it's fine because as you-- do you guys leave okay you gather your things up you leave out into the street to go onto the next leg of your evening adventure and that's where we'll close tonight's episode (groaning) i feel like it would be wonderful and i feel like there would be a lot of very angry disappointed people i know he's old and stinky
