was pretty creative well done hmm that's a 6th-level spell anyway welcome back to catch up on what previously occurred the mighty nein had decided to leave zadash in the wake of the now declared war between the dwendalian empire and the xhorhasian hordes to the east you decided to side with the gentleman a purveyor of various darker and underhanded deeds throughout this side of the empire who offered you two possible contracted options you chose both and proceeded onto your first leg of this journey to the northeast to the labenda swamp and to the city of berleben where you were tasked to discover what had happened to a safe house of which various smuggled goods would be stored and then transported through that had gone dark for a number of weeks you packed up made your way in that direction traversed through the outskirts of the swamp managed to save a tiny bird friend from being consumed by a few large crocodiles and scoured the swamp city of berleben in search of some means of information to find the individual that the gentleman says would be able to help you in this journey febron febron was found drunk and disorderly in the keystone pub oh so sexy he's a right nice one but no you managed to interrogate him made him an offer he couldn't refuse and he agreed to lead you onto where the safe house exists within the swamp you rented out the rooms in the subterranean chambers of the old and almost collapsed pub you separated yourselves for the evening completed your rest and we pick up as morning comes to greet you lightless as there are no windows and you just eventually come to on what you assume is an evening's full rest you all independently come to shake your heads and get yourselves prepared for what the next day's journey arises you gather your things and you glare at the rather awkward febron across the way who as you wake up is just sitting there watching you sleep marisha and well i mean i'm ready to do whatever you want lead the way you guys begin to-- (chirping) (like jester) it's sharp (chirping) you guys all begin to gather and make your way up the ladder through the hatch in the floor of the keystone pub which is not bustling by any means there are maybe three patrons in the process of having their morning ale you glance over the side and you can see dent bonswallow who's in the process of cleaning off a number of the glasses from the night before he looks over in your direction and goes oh right bright morning to you all rise up would you like breakfast of some kind hey right coming right up go an find a place to sit be with you in about an hour well i've got to make your food (grumbling) he's counting about an hour yeah that's all situated there there is in the far corner of the chamber the back wall opposite to the right of where the stage is being constructed-- though right now it looks like there's no current construction going on at the moment-- a hooded figure is slowly walking towards the table where you guys are deciding or not whether to sit okay you manage to sit on one of the small benches on the side scrapes the ground as you push into the side and the-- the cloaked figure stops and takes in this physical display and then continues to approach mark if you want to step in (laughter) mark hulmes long-time friend dungeon master of high rollers the first thing you see the individuals you have been waiting throughout the evening to show up begin to step through groggily complain about the space and then claim a table as you begin to approach which you are greeted with stares and a cat butthole (chirping) (like jester) a bird (like jester) she walks around (like cali) hello (whistles) she pulls a dagger out (like jester) your underwear make a perception check all right glancing about-- make an insight check welcome to playing with caleb 15 okay it seems to be rather forthright yeah seems to be on the level yeah she seems nervous you know based on what you're asking as far as the features if i recall they're was it half-elven everybody who is legal within the empire i think it's pretty sexy to be honest you see febron there is this creepier old man balding little liver spotted missing most of his teeth one eye wandering a bit (like nott) welcome to the mighty nein the little bird creature begins to chirp in your direction (like cali) hello kiri i'm cali (like cali) you're kiri (chirping) for the sake of expediency you share what information you choose to in that space of time but food does come to you piecemeal as your fine dent bonswallow friend decides to deliver it plate by plate as it arrives it's passable most of it's a little overcooked breakfast meats bit of rubbery egg and that's about it a good swamp breakfast (growling) you hear this deep horrible growling sound that echoes around you you see kiri's feathers fluffing up as she does it (growling) (growling) it's the sound of the crocodiles from the battle before kiri starts fluffing and loosely purring back nothing that was howling-esque necessarily but you didn't travel too far into the swamp (like jester) this is kiri there's at this point two other patrons but they're not really paying attention jesus christ that's your arm yeah that's febron don't get me wrong i still think it's pretty foxy been around as long as i have you live a life of beggars can't be choosers (like jester) welcome to the mighty nein you gather your things finish off the remainder of your lackluster breakfast at this point now the morning air is chilled though there is still humidity that permeates the swamp vicinity you hear the bugs beginning to grow louder with the distant cicada/cricket sounds in the distance echoing through the swamp there is a low fog that is fairly prominent this early in the morning you can see about 15 or 20 feet beyond the barrier of the outer swamp before the moisture begins to pick up you see just the shaded trunks of trees beyond that for another 60 or so feet before it becomes completely obscured by fog this time of year it does it's just getting close to winter not zero visibility you have traveling about 30 feet of general visibility and then it begins to get a little bit beyond that at this point febron chimes in don't worry it burns off a bit as the day goes on i mean we're going to go through all of it really but we're going to head for the outside of the ounterloch the ounterloch we're heading towards the lake we're going to try and make our way around the outskirts of it but we're going to have to coast through the swamp to get there that way we're not trudging through the main central area too much oh i wouldn't recommend taking that with us no as you guys are plotting a means out there kiri has the dagger out and is practicing little swings excitedly then she goes charging towards the fog it's the mist kiri has run past the barrier of the puddles on the north side of the city and is now swinging wildly into the fog runs back feet leaving a trail behind as she's stepping through two to three inches of swamp water across this district (chirping) there's lots of creatures around that could hurt you she gets right behind yasha and sticks right to her back with the dagger out on the opposite side going-- make a perception check you take a moment to scout the vicinity at this point in the morning it's maybe about nine o'clock or so judging by where you can see the source of sunlight in the somewhat clouded sky glancing around the city not a lot of folks are moving it seems like the nature of the swamp town is a little bit of a slower pace of living by the nature of the location the few folks that are wandering around the streets are slowly getting to their daily chores and business no one seems to be particularly interested a few folks look over because you are a gathered motley crew on the edge of town but there's no one who seems to be very focused in what's going on fire fire fire fire (chirping) wrapped around his weenie so we good to go ready to move the longer we take the more risk we run of getting there about nighttime and i would feel a bit nervous about that to be honest okay so who's leading laura and i'm pointing the direction no but i'm not standing at the front 100 gold i'm pointing the direction but look at me i'm not going to defend you well yeah but if i die first you're going to be lost in this swamp nott where are you kiri on your shoulders there's kiri she's up there with the two feathered arms flopped over and (chirping) looking around (like cali) mee-ster ford at this point febron's like all right so looking out this direction this time of day-- that way lead on big boy as you guys begin to step past the outskirts of the puddles your feet begin to sink thicker and thicker into the swamp floor as you further and further step away from this little bastion of civilization with each progressive footstep you can see the waves ripple past and then hit patches of thick elevated vegetation that's growing and rotting in small clusters simultaneously the tree trunks that are faded shadows begin to come into view and you begin to see these twisted gnarled trees covered in vines that dangle down from these high boughs that barely cluster out sections of sunlight and you pass out underneath those areas where bits of cloud begin to break through ah gotcha ah boughs yeah it's fine in pushing this forward and guiding the path i'm going to have febron and whoever is keeping watch on the exterior to both make survival checks right well this isn't a perception check this is to make their way through the swamp to keep track of what's ahead so i'm having febron and one of you take point on that this is a survival check actually you both rolled pretty high over the next two hours or so you guys manage to keep for the most part above any of the deeper recesses of marsh water leaping from cluster of tree base and sections of ground that are mostly above the water line it manages to go through without much of an issue the fog does slowly begin to burn off as the hours progress but it's still present you gather probably about the time you arrived at the end of day yesterday to the exterior of the labenda swamp there was just a faint bit of fog at the ground it will be a number of hours before you even reach that point but it is progressing towards a more visible space these two hours you guys continue forward being mindful and watching around those who are keeping watch i need both of you to make perception checks or one of you make it with advantage your choice whoever else is keeping a watch you want to make it nott go for it febron at this point's still looking he says wait hold on a second he starts doing a little circle in the area checking out some of the recent trees looking at the sun in the sky and he's like yeah i feel like we're going the right way yeah we don't usually leave this early in the morning (noncommittal grunt) yeah liam and he pulls out a half-filled wineskin opens it up pours the water out he looks curiously at the flask and the amount of liquid you poured in there cheers indeed tiny girl he watches as you drink the alcohol and is confused gets a closer look at you at this point and he goes-- right aye it's this way make another survival check well it was febron and beau well this one they're doing it individually because you have somebody outside of-- along the path as you guys are progressing for the next hour or so febron and beau are keeping pace on this keeping watch moving forward you step through some of the soggier areas of the swamp and your foot gets stuck a bit and it's starting to get a little more difficult to traverse febron's like it's just a few more hours and we'll make our way to the outskirts of the lake it'll be a lot easier then trust me it'll be fine at this point fjord as you are stepping near the front you come around the corner and without notice there's this strange sound this (airy puff) and there's a cloud of pollen-like spores in the air right where you are i need you to make a wisdom saving throw please laura and you manage to pull back coughing a bit and your head goes dazed for a moment but you manage to shrug it off you guys look ahead and beyond the area where fjord was pushing around one of the trees you can see this large 30-foot wide cloud of yellowish pollen that went (airy puff) and slowly settles into the swamp area there's a whole mess of twisted vines and plant matter in the center of the space where it seemed to emit from the center though you do see one large fern-type plant that's left open and three or four large leaves that are spread outward i haven't actually seen this close to one of them i usually avoid them so let's avoid it eh first off i resent that no i'll take that i mean i figure it's probably in the way burn it if you can i don't trust it this vicinity is about 30 feet around this particular plant in the center that's lying open face to the sky it would encompass the plant definitely it emits this large blast of orangish-red fire that burns in the area go ahead and roll damage she's filled with a baby 28 points of fire damage this explosion immediately evaporates the fog in the area and a large part of the ground now is dried off you see this mist or steam (hiss) out of where the detonation happened the plant in the center which is now more visible you can see snap shut this giant three four part maw closes in the space with these plant-like teeth it's still there writhing in pain from the explosion it laxes open a bit and begins to shift in your direction it looks hurt but still alive all right fire bolt sacred flame that's cocked that's a 15 15 yeah so no sacred flame but-- 17 hits roll damage yes or no-- yeah for sacred flame yeah 12 12 points of damage as you slam it with the fire bolt it (shrieks) and keeps moving forward but it's hurt rolled another 15 16 sorry you guys are all preparing your various cantrips and spells against it it begins lurching forward you can see the charred edges of this large vegetable plant then fjord steps forward sending this arc of darker gray-green energy that strikes into it roll damage-- roll to hit first 16 hits as it strikes this large trap-like plant it hits the center of it it bubbles up for a second the green and red matter of the interior swells and then pops like a horrible flesh-filled water balloon spatters across various areas you guys have to take a step back and it glides against your knees and thighs a bit it just manages to avoid you but it lies now decimated and sinking slowly into the swamp water make a perception check who else wants to make a perception check 13 okay a brief breeze blows through the swamp as you guys move on from this positioning you hear a very faint hiss through the distant branches of the trees singing in unison as bits of leaves and vines clatter against themselves from the shift but you manage to catch a sound upon the wind that is unfamiliar to the rest of the natural breeze it's like a chime like a wooden chime (dull thunks) you can listen up and can hear it for a moment too as the breeze blows through a second time kiri makes the same sound (dull thunks) looks like it's a little bit northward of where you're headed a little north-- i mean it could be it's loosely on the way if you trust it we could avoid it though i don't know what the hell that is i haven't heard that out here before are you sure about that i'm helping you thank you sure you cause some of the swamp mass to pull back a bit frumpkin takes a little bit because this terrain is not very conducive to prowling cats of frumpkin's size but frumpkin heads on for a bit coming across the source of this sound you see about 100 or so feet ahead in the direction where you heard the sound hanging from one of the branches there is indeed a cluster of carved chimes that are dangling from a piece of twine there they're banging into each other every now and then when the breeze slowly comes through on a branch yeah you can give a perception check for frumpkin 16 okay from frumpkin's view underneath you can get a close look at it and the material of the chimes isn't wood it appears to be yellowed old dried hollowed bone the twine itself is not twine it appears to have been tanned or dried sinew sinew currently it's just the one chime it doesn't catch your mind as anything that is a defensive mechanism to undead that you would recognize it is about seven feet above frumpkin okay frumpkin manages to climb the tree using the outside of the somewhat twisted bark getting to the top from that viewing point as frumpkin gets out there you can-- (laughs) you do see from the top of the branch beyond the edge of the fog there looks to be a thick tree that has broken and fallen over about ten feet from the base the heavy roots rise up into this trunk that still stands about nine or ten feet from the base of the swamp floor it appears like there is a hollow carved into it circular and a curtain that is currently pressed bolted or nailed into it that is partially blocking an opening into the tree it's hanging down and every now and then a faint breeze comes through and you see it shift ever so slightly but it's a heavy material okay as frumpkin-- make a stealth check okay good to know it is better than 12 frumpkin stalks up through avoiding the sleight depressed elements of the floor that fill with the thicker bog water coming upon the outskirts you can see the curtain that hangs is not cloth it appears to be a scaled leather-like material actually pretty similar to what you had carved from the crocodile the day before but long weathered and it's dry towards the top but the base of it seems to have been progressively moistened by the swamp around it as such it's slightly decomposing and it has a bit of moss and algae that's grown on it giving it a lighter green at the tip looking inside there is a layer of bones that are all broken and chipped to the point where it's given a textured base to the floor from this view you're not able to make out what the bone source is or what they're from but there is a gentle layer of bones of varying degrees of age to them within there you also see-- there is natural rot on the inside of this trunk that's let it easily be carved away there appears to be a matted pile of something in the corner other than that in the brief instant that frumpkin's paying attention it appears to be empty frumpkin returns to his realm you didn't get a good long look at them you literally got in quickly and went (poof) in the brief instant you looked in there you got a few details in the interior before pulling way that's not true at all it's right here it's that way that's what i said yeah you continue moving on febron goes all right that way and he points in the direction and ushers you forward what pace are you moving at normal pace slow pace fast pace okay medium pace it is you could you have to move at a slow pace to move stealthily though for the most of it yeah as you continue on febron and-- beau are you the other one with febron doing the survival checks make one more as you guys begin to watch the treeline slowly thin febron's like oh it's a good sign we're getting very close to getting out of this fucking swamp and getting next to the ounterloch that'll lead us there no issue no more of this right as he's saying that you watch him about to step into another one of those open plants that begins to quake and you watch as it's about to release this burst of pollen beau you don't stop him you just point it out it goes (puffing) he goes what (coughing) and starts walking straight towards it make an athletics check for you to try and grapple him acrobatics sorry athletics for you to grapple him you reach and grab him but he shrugs off your arm and starts walking he continues to walk towards it and then glides up in the air and is floating he's reaching towards it and the plant (slurping) and is trying to reach for him he's now floating and slowly rotating in the air like (grunting) it takes you the better part of a minute to finally shake him out of it before he goes oh is it-- what shit (yelling) shit what's going on the plant's still below him going like (slurping) you poke him and he begins to glide over-- the plant is now turning towards him slowly shifting in his direction and he's like backing away there's a fucking-- yeah you move around the side and you pull him away you guys begin to pick up your pace this plant is not very fast-moving and you even moving at your slower pace it can't keep up with you and it eventually gives up and disappears into the fog behind you i love that you roll a 20 to see it before him and and went sure i love it it's great yeah all righty i've been through it a few times but usually it's with a group of other smugglers and they take care of me and protect me like you are thank you make an insight check it's hard to read okay you know i appreciate that i don't appreciate you casting spells to fuck with all my mind and shit but i've been honest i'm going to make some honest coin and i'm doing my fucking best all right now come on it's this way (stuttering) not north where we're going at this point you guys can see the very edge of the water is now starting to show through the fog and you can see where bits of the lake are hitting the shoreline and you have reached the ounterloch in the middle of the labenda swamp yeah i don't know i don't go into it i recommend not getting too close just in case we usually stay right on the coastal side of it you know perfect no what're you doing no shit the whole time you're doing that kiri's like (chirping) who's keeping watch on this yes i need you and probably beau since you were with febron before make a perception check please okay as you guys are trudging along on the bank of this lake heading northward fjord out of the corner of your eye you see a shadow shift in the trees to the left of you you glance back and you see something disappear behind a tree about 40 50 feet off to the left side so you guys are heading towards the shadow you saw fjord molly and yasha like that and beau you begin to turn and approach and you guys form your line moving forward you watch as something lumbering moves it's still on the edge of the fog and it shifts from the tree where it was to a tree further back and then ducks behind another tree it's not very stealthy though it thinks it might be it seems to be moving fairly easily in the terrain okay make a stealth check okay as you tiptoe through the edges leaping from cluster of root to cluster of root being as quiet as you can you come around the first tree where this figure had vanished look around to where it's currently waiting and you see two trees that grew together and a large rock that's wedged at the base of it crouched below behind the rock you see this bulbous humanoid creature with a deep green-blue skin tone with little pustules and boils on it at the edges of the shoulder and arm you see long stringy black hair that goes past the front of the chest the torso appears to be swollen this belly protruding beyond it you can see hanging around the neck other pieces of hollowed bone very similar to that chime that you saw being described by caleb it appears to be trollish in nature the pustules and part of its body there's this thick green liquid that's oozing out in places it's sitting there clinging to the rock with its long fingers clutching it looking over in the direction of where you were breathing heavy it seems to be looking in the direction where you were he doesn't see you at the moment no you're about 35 feet from it you could certainly try make a sleight of hand check to do so without making a very visible toss you take the handful and lob them quietly as far as you can you hear very faint impacts of them about 25 30 feet off the trollish creature goes (snarling) and pushes off the rock a bit looking that direction looks over the rock looks back in that direction it's now looking like he's paranoid and keeping tabs on both sides make another stealth check you manage pull back to the rest of the group as you guys are holding your line waiting for beau to return (like fjord) you're a fan of pie (chirping) do you guys continue onward you are out in the open at the edge of where the lake is beyond the treeline being stealthy here means being quiet but you're still very much out in the open i'm saying if an entity knows you're there if you're not trying to obscure your visual you're going to have a hard time avoiding it as you guys push on febron's looking extremely nervous now that you've mentioned this creature wait are you saying you saw this troll thing over there only heard rumors and we talk about various things that live out there trolls is definitely one of them through the ages there have been all sorts of stories there's uglier trolls here swamp trolls mountain trolls all types and this one it wouldn't surprise me i haven't seen one but i stay perfectly quiet quieter than you usually do as a group i'm just going to stay here and clings behind you fjord like as a shield you guys move on taking care to be quiet but not out of sight if you want to be stealthy in that regard make a stealth check so then no stealth so you guys continue pushing forward at your regular pace (like nott) you're a cultist you're a cultist yasha and fjord as they're having this conversation you're watching at the flanks and you can see the shape of that troll creature is still moving from tree to tree keeping pace with your movement it's not approaching you but it's keeping pace you're not in the center of the swamp where it's a lot of shifting topography and roots and vines and patches of deep water you have to come across you're along the coast of this lake so it's mainly soggy dirt and sand so it's not rough terrain where you are yes but you also have no protection you're literally out in the open make a perception check you do not no because you don't know if this creature's undead or not (chirping) (like nott) it's me bren (chirping) pulls the dagger out if you're doing this stealthily then i need anyone who's trying to not be seen to make a stealth check beau's stealthing to the north which will be here fjord you guys are heading inward jester where are you standing you guys are heading northward this way you guys have to go this way because the lake's all this direction nott and kiri are back here and that would be-- go off to that side febron is like i'm going to stay back here with the people in the back-back because i want to stay in the back you guys begin to trudge in deeper into the swamp yeah they're pretty stale you're fine as you begin to move into the swamp you do see the shape and it's about maybe 60 or so feet from where you are you watch it shift and then shift to another tree a little further away he's moving away from you make a perception check you see one shape move it's similar to the one you saw before you can ascertain that it probably is the same creature yeah make a deception check no you don't need to after that we'll see if he can see through the illusion it skips ahead just keeps walking in that direction 50 feet 60 feet gets relatively close to where you saw the shape vanish from behind the tree one of the claws-- the long stringy hair dangling somewhat stuck to its neck shifting with the light breeze that blows through as it looks back and watches the illusion turn and shift is it relatively close to the tree the illusion it sits there and waits shifts it shifts back in its space a little bit as soon as it gets within about five or so feet the illusion the troll creature reaches out and swings out to grab the illusion passes through and the claws (slash) into the tree it goes (frantic grunting) and then vanishes behind the tree you watch it dart the shadow of it vanish behind another tree and it's moving further away from where you are how long does that last lasts for a minute you guys cluster together outside of the swamp alongside the curvature of the lake keeping an eye on the side you continue to travel forward the lake slowly begins to as you guys are heading northward along its side it begins to curve to a northeastern direction and febron's like all right so this is good we're getting closer to the northern side of the lake which means we're getting close to where we follow the pearl blades to the safe house good okay at this point you look over to the side who's keeping a watch on this okay both of you guys roll a perception check please 15 you said you do see the shape now keeping pace with you again same distance out there it's stalking you but it's definitely-- you get the sense based on the interaction you had earlier and the distance it's keeping-- it's not interested in fighting nine of you it's waiting to pick one of you off and take it wherever it's going to take it it's smart enough to know that it's not going to jump into a fray in the open space but it's definitely waiting to see what weaker one stays to the back you guys continue heading in a northeastern direction until eventually you watch the lake come to a northern peak and begin to curve back into a southern area it looks like the top of the lake bends to a point northward and then begins to head southward and level out at this point febron goes all right good from here we head northward into the swamp we're looking for daggers with pearl hilts in the trees those are the markers there's six of them that lead us there he's going to make a perception check he looks a bit lost someone want to help him out with this make a perception check as well it takes you a moment but you manage to catch-- the third or fourth tree into the treeline and you see a gleaming pearl-hilted dagger that is jammed about five feet off the ground into one of the thicker pieces of tree bark on the exterior of one of these trees it's this little mark that looks like someone jammed a whittling knife into it and left it there and he goes that's one good okay that means we're going the right way moving up looking for the next one go ahead and roll both of you go there at the same time matt and all right second one moving on looking for the third this one takes a little longer to find all right yeah you find the third febron finds the fourth fifth one because he did not find it but you locate it yeah with that point he goes okay i'm pretty sure we're almost there he points ahead and you can see where there's a cluster of trees a new sight catches your attention the first thing that hits you is this faint scent of rotting flesh it hits your nose a bit and your eyes sting water for the moment as your vision focuses on the first corpse a human man propped up on a spear going up through the side of his torso and out his left pectoral his stomach is bloated and his skin is dull gray and glistening his jaw hangs open his expression this horrible ghastly grimace a few feet from him stuck to one of the trees you see a halfling woman with two blades jammed through her shoulders pinning her up legs dangling but one leg is partially torn off her head is mounted down hair in her face so you can't make out any features and they're both placed up there right against this opening to a small clearing ahead and this is where febron goes and that's what i'm talking about that's the warning whoever did this is trying to keep us out fuck no from what you're looking at they're both about as fresh as the other they both have their jaws intact from what you can tell the female halfling you can't make out the features of the face because the hair is in the way and dangling the other one's is open they both look pretty dead make an investigation check no traps nothing like that you do notice there are wounds across the body beyond the leg missing there are a number of wounds you can make a medicine check to try and ascertain what they are okay they seem to be a combination of bite and claw marks not super deep slashing but definitely a gash across the shoulder the neck there is one large puncture wound about that wide that's right around where the sternum is but whatever punctured it one of the edges is torn out like something hooked was placed in and then pulled through dragging the flesh with it intact no you do not recognize this person lifeless you do see some rough elements of tattoos along the neck similar to the banded neck tattoos of members of the gentleman's crew that you had seen before not as thick and dense but you can see that there is a pattern to the acquisition of some of these tattoos for the ones who run the smuggling line you're starting to ascertain and put that together but intact kiri pulls a blade and gets behind cali and is like (like jester) i've never done this before (like jester) be careful you watch as a tiny dagger goes into the tree next to it and kiri's around cali's going-- (cawing whimpering) as the chest breathes in some of the air escapes some of the wounds and there's bits of matter- the head settles down and looks right-- febron leaps back he's like shit and backs up a little bit he looks really uncomfortable with this whole thing you don't think he was prepared for any sort of dead-raising circumstance is this fucking necromancy he keeps backing away now the corpse's face of this halfling woman turns towards you (inhaling) (whispered voice) swamp fishmen from under the ground many weeks two maybe three we cut when we could they bleed but too many kiri comes up and grabs the dagger wedges it out of the tree and turns to cali and goes (like cali) if it bleeds we can kill it points it back to the corpse febron he's 20 feet behind you he's keeping a little back from the whole undead thing at which point from behind one of the trees (growling) the troll reaches out and grabs him by the torso pulls him back and you hear him scream as the troll grabs him tucks him under his arm (snarling) and begins leaping away from you okay go for it make an attack you go running (splashes) all righty let me get the-- that is the troll this is the opening of the clearing here where you guys were talking to the halfling that was stapled to the tree right there essentially yeah you guys all spin and watch this happening kiri's over by the edge of the tree with you and caleb where were you you would have probably been over here near nott technically this would be north yes that area's north yes what did you roll that did miss nice the troll spins and goes running with febron going (screaming) in its grasp it starts lumbering leaping from tree to tree its legs while it has this bulbous swollen midsection these thin frog-like legs are giving these fairly decent leaps from section to section its other arm grasping onto the trees as it runs you can see this is definitely its home terrain as these magic missiles swarm out and slam into its body with each impact that green ichor sprays across febron and it starts to burn into his skin he's (screaming) febron goes limp-- (cheering and groaning) correct that's a four seven points of acid got it as it slams it begins to burn the back of the skin you watch a bit of steam rise off of its shoulder it definitely is wounding the creature this large swollen troll is still making a break i need everyone to roll initiative now 25 to 20 20 to 15 nott and molly 15 to ten ten to five eight ashley it's incredible is that everybody i think so yeah top of the round as it's bounding behind with an unconscious guide under its arm jester you're up first all righty what type of damage is it which he does not make he rolled a 12 six points of damage as the energy coalesces and the bell (impact) in the range of this creature it impacts it and it staggers for a second and the pustules on its body emit more of that poison that finishes your go cali you're up cool this strange barrier of arcane energy forms around cali's body giving this little essence of vigor and the body swells a bit that finishes your turn nott you're up within 30 feet you can stop about there go for it yeah that hits technically no because he's aware that you were there and is not currently flanked by any allies five points of piercing damage it strikes and sticks into the back and more of that green stuff begins to spray out of the wound where it hit in the vicinity it's creating bursts of this toxic sludge that's oozing from its body around it each time you're hitting it 13 that does not hit it manages to hit the tree that's near it and sticking into that one there there's quite a bit of it on febron actually yes you are i'd say in this clearing you're not in terribly difficult terrain you're moving around okay it's not too bad the further you get into it this way it starts getting a little more-- like in the cluster of trees in here it starts getting a harder to move in that ends nott's turn molly you're up okay that is a 14 what is it wisdom 13 your dc on that is it's charisma-based right this is your racial it succeeds it's a ten unfortunately that would have stopped it in its tracks is that your turn do you want to move closer okay so you move up to there okay that finishes molly's go beau and fjord you guys are up (counting) you do you get right up into its body they both hit great what else are you doing oh nice all right 21 that is a plus five on its constitution saving throw trolls man it resists the stunning strike you still have your bonus though ten damage third strike okay cool you rush forward slamming into it with your staff and your fists striking into its body with each impact it takes you a moment to realize what's happening but that spray is covering your face and as it does the venom is pushing into your flesh and burning upon contact you take nine points of poison damage you take another nine points of poison damage you take 15 points of poison damage a total of-- sorry 15 nine and nine so that's 34 34 points of poison damage 33 sorry febron by the way fucking dead you see now he's coated in this toxin the eyes are open and now pouring out of his mouth is foam at the edge with his tongue lolling out yeah as it was fleeing all the impacts covered him with the same toxic stuff and sent him straight to his grave that ends beau's turn fjord what are you doing all right two attacks on it that hits both hit woo nice both parts of its back where they impact the flesh tears open revealing the muscle beneath and as it does more of it sprays beau-- you take five points of poison damage correct it was 15 plus 18 so it's 33 you just took another 20 points of poison damage beau falls onto the ground arms limp covered in this toxic substance that ends your turn fjord okay so it is now the troll's turn the troll does not regenerate because you did acid damage to it with your last attack which prevents it from regaining any hit points however it's still currently clutching the body of febron under its arm it's going for a straight bolt it looks down and sees beau unconscious uses its action to pick beau up under the other arm-- nope now it's going to use its full movement that's 30 it is right where the marker is right there yeah this is a pickle guys that ends the troll's turn caleb you're up right there is when you start getting to rough terrain so that's as far as you get-- which the troll is not affected by you've noticed that it's in its home turf what are you doing caleb magic missile on its head okay go ahead and roll for the damage on that okay you are now holding concentration on haste nott you feel suddenly the world slows ever so slightly and you feel this burst of adrenaline in your body that's your turn yasha you're up don't forget if you rage and don't attack or are attacked by the end of your next turn you lose your rage so if you're not planning to attack it or if there's not going to be something attacking you you're losing a rage for the day so keep that in mind it's either attack or be attacked you don't have to take damage necessarily so it's taking damage so it's you attacking or taking damage yeah unfortunately you're starting to get through some sludge you can yeah all right that's as close as you can get right there you are you don't have an action to use it anymore unfortunately yeah what do you yell i give you two bonus actions make an intimidation check well it's charisma-based but depending on the intimidation you can use your strength modifier instead okay with your strength modifier it makes sense and it's how we did it in the last campaign too it's one of the rules that they say you can use for your campaign charisma or strength for your intimidation because it makes sense for you my favorite pike line by the way in pillars of eternity 22 all right okay it turns around and glances at you and it looks shaken i'll say for the purposes of this it's frightened of you until the end of your next turn yeah does that finish your turn yasha unfortunately-- it's now kiri's turn kiri holding a dagger-- she just holds the dagger that's kiri's turn and shouts (like jester) fuck jester it's your turn yeah you're within 60 feet oh shit okay so you are conscious okay so when we come to your turn you can do that you come to consciousness and you're like (panting) and your body hurts there's all this stinging from the toxin burning your skin and flesh you're chucked under and you can feel the claws digging into part of your thigh and side as you're being run along by this giant troll creature it smells awful this heavy scent of rotting citrus and fungus that's permeating from its body that finishes your turn jester that was your bonus you still have your action sacred flame you got it holding there cali you're up you can get that close right now with the speed of 30 feet yeah interesting for the purposes of this make an arcana check and this is going to be your attempt to break the grapple of the troll ten not very good at arcana two fucking you're a lucky son of a bitch it has a plus four on its strength roll ripping from the grip of the troll beau gets lifted into the air and is now hovering there yeah you can do that beau is now lifted up into the tree you're just within reach of branches when it comes to your turn i'm going to be honest you almost killed her man scorching ray if those all had hit beau's dead i was like oh fuck i got real nervous magic missile would have done the same too because it's a splash per missile go for it dex save for you natural 20 and then for you dex save as well that is an eight yes splashes out no one is close enough to be impacted by the effect febron's dead febron's like-- kind of his arms and legs are dangling behind as it's dragging him through it's pretty rough not beyond anything else ending cali's turn nott you're up currently no that's as close as you can get right there that's not quite within 30 feet for water walking right i'll say for that purpose it does give you the extra movement there so now you're just within 30 feet wisdom save is a 13 what's your dc 14 it fails it immediately falls prone laughing with the corpse of febron being flailed about in the air as it's spinning the legs and arms-- well technically you can only do the bonus action to attack if you use the attack action oh because you're hasted that's right sorry i was thinking of the bonus action you're correct that hits no because you do not have advantage on the attack unfortunately nice it sinks into it you do because it's an attack action okay that hits to two oh man that sucks seven points of damage that finishes your turn nott well done on the ground you're firing both of those they're sticking inside these sprays of poison toxin out of his body as it's laughing on the ground for tasha's hideous laughter does it get a chance to break nope that was a two the second roll was a 16 so it succeeds it fell prone gave you disadvantage on the attacks and then got out of your spell lesson learned but it is prone that finishes your turn nott molly right here it rolled a three minus one so it succeeds it takes what type of psychic damage interesting okay so psychic damage strikes it and it does not spray the venomous toxin upon receiving the psychic damage but it is grabbing its head now the laughter has subsided it's trying to get back to its feet that finishes your turn molly beau you're up in the trees fjord you're on the ground you're levitating sure you still have the levitation spell on you so if you were to leap you'd just glide okay so you're on the branch there 15 just hits when it is prone you have disadvantage so roll again to attack it's a ranged attack 14 just misses it sinks into the swamp mud next to it one more time because this has disadvantage okay so that does hit roll damage on the second one that is correct ten four plus-- damage bonus eight that's what i thought eight points of damage the shuriken sinks into its chest another spray of toxin nothing in the vicinity to take the damage that finish your turn you do no it's only unarmed i think that's your turn fjord you're up go for it disadvantage on each strike they both go passing right over its body as it's trying to get up it slips for a second and what would've hit it ducks out of the way just in time and both of them arc off hitting nothing that finishes your turn it's now the troll's turn it gets up half its movement and it's going to run 15 feet this way and then a full action run for another 30 feet and it's darting off with the corpse of febron under its arm it has its prize and it's running off into the swamp it's hurting but you're watching its flesh stitch together a little more and starting to heal up from some of the wounds is anybody pursuing all right go ahead and roll for that nope the fire bolt vanishes beyond its space there anybody else with a ranged attack that wants to try and make it go for it at this range it is 12 misses it's starting to hit the mist and its form is starting to become a little harder to see and it's running with such an intense speed you do and a bonus action attack if you want to 14 no just misses roll damage it does strike eight points of damage it manages to catch it it's still running fjord you're the only one with a proper ranged attack here if you want to try go ahead and roll damage it gets blasted still going well now it takes its next turn to do a full 60-foot run at this point the fact that you guys are having a hard time hitting it and the rate that it's healing you're starting to think-- yeah i'm just saying you can continue to pursue if you want to you guys are right at the edge of where these bodies have been propped up as a warning which from what febron told you was placed up to prevent people from coming towards the safe house you're starting to get close to it as far as you know as you approach the head is tracking you the whole time the head curves off to the right between the tree that it's stapled to and the other body that's propped up 100 feet that way you don't see any safe house you don't see anything like that at that point the head (sighs) continues back looks to be two shortswords have been jammed into it shortswords make an investigation check okay rummaging through the pockets and the various baubles you can find you find four pieces of gold a handful of about 12 silver-- this is on the halfling-- a charm looks like it's made from a dried animal foot of some kind like a dog or a coyote (imitates a hiccup) and a note that's keeping track of locations but it's mostly soaked now and the ink has all run and you make out bits of words here and there but it makes no sense to you yeah the paper is now dry and a full piece of paper but the ink is still as smeared and lost as it was before the few words you make out involve a time one of them says two hours past the noon sun that's the most you make out of one sentence part of it's smeared it's like steve martin in the jerk trying to read the love letter (gibberish) the other things you can make out are four men required and then another one saying something about shady-- and that's all you make out okay we'll take a short rest here and while we're

you asap the_bowmeister ja possibly would be back into the game we go ugh (blood spraying) indeed bringing us back into the game you guys have taken your short rest healed up a bit and recovered from the chaos of the swamp you managed to trudge through you've lost your guide but you've survived thus far the rest of you at least what would you like to do oh you were casting-- yes utilizing detect magic you were saying-- on nothing magical within what was found on the bodies no correct no at this point it's later afternoon maybe it's like two or three o'clock maybe you left early enough in the day where you aren't threatened for dusk for another few hours you guys continue on past the tree make an investigation check that's true outside of the space around you or the trinkets found within the corpses nothing but you do see the mild glow from the bracelet on cali's arm make a religion check you can make a religion check if you want to try and recall information 13 you've heard of the scaled tyrant you don't know a whole lot of information but you know through your research that one of the entities that partook in elements of the calamity no not at all is definitely considered one of the betrayer gods in the calamity though very selfish and is considered by many to be the patron-- whether it be the mother of or the patron of chromatic dragons at this point nott has completed quite a thorough sweep of the vicinity as you move forward no traps you do notice as you head into this next open clearing there's thick patches of vines and roots that descend into a circular space that is awash with swamp water and general bog rot that is floating over the surface like a moat has formed naturally around this giant banyan tree about 30 or 40 feet across from side to side it is gargantuan the roots rise up and merge at different places where the tree itself begins to expand about ten feet up before it reaches out and curves and carves into the earth before disappearing beneath the water the still awful swamp water that surrounds it you also see across the front of its trunk in the vicinity at least the bits where the sunlight comes through from the rather choked boughs above that are shading the area quite heavily six more bodies tied to branches and roots with rope and vine their bodies covered with similar wounds as the ones you inspected before some are slumped against the base of the roots some are held up and vines wrapped around them and they are stapled at an angle onto the sides of the tree they're all currently placed as a warning to either notify or fend off anyone who would wander too close nope you can part areas of it but it's about 15 feet across as far as the width of it and it changes in width depending on which place on the tree you head it is essentially a waist-deep area of water so you could move with it and-- you can bring it to just past knee height within a very localized area to you kind of there's a big clearing around this tree it's natural for the most part but it looks like this area is centered around the tree make a perception check well no you haven't submerged in the water yet but it looks about waist high as you lower the water level you do glance up and see a band of teal fabric tied around one of the branches or the edges of the roots at the top part about ten feet up that has been weathered and dirtied from just being there for a long time a lot of the color has faded but you just barely pick out its location it looks like it might have been a bandana that was wrapped and tied around a root above okay so you wade through the water beau make an athletics check to try and climb the tree athletics to climb the tree it takes a while to even get close but the general moisture in the air makes it slick and you keep slipping down the side you can try roll-- a tiny piece of teal fabric tied-- eight to ten feet up (popping noise) do you untie it okay you pull it and you bring it down it's an old starched weathered bandana about three feet oh yeah so now the water's clear and you can see below there's thick sediment muck a few bones of some wayward creature that long has been left to rot beneath the water but there's nothing living in there aside from toads tadpoles other small slithering natural creatures that call the swamp home okay so you make your way through catching up to beau and fjord who are at the base of the tree you get up to the base of the tree now the rest of you guys follow suit you all cross past the water path you're now at the base of the tree you nott have the strange teal faded scarf now in your grasp yeah the gif machine the gif machine sam riegel oh god the branch itself is pretty sturdy the portions of the tree here do not bend very much and it doesn't seem to react the strength of the mage hand isn't very strong make an investigation check 12 yeah you glance around and as you were placing your hands against part of it some of it shifts it wobbles now getting a glance there's a piece of weathered driftwood or separate wood that has been pressed up and tucked behind some of the roots to look like it's part of the tree but it's a little bit of a different texture a different type of wood and as you press on it it wiggles you shift it-- make an investigation check 16 it does not appear to be trapped you wiggle it out pull it free and now you can see about a four-foot carved hollow in the tree that leads to a dark lightless interior all right it glows like a torchlight in the vicinity as you step inside fjord you notice a fairly well-cleared interior that smells of marsh water and lamp oil glancing about there are two hooks on the wall that have been jammed in that carry the top part of some sort of oil lantern that has been shattered against the wall the glass itself is broken the metal is bent and you now can see there's some soaked lamp oil that has fallen from those impacts that has hit the ground on the wall nearby and is offering that additional smell to the room the floor is somewhat soggy with moss and bits of sand and gravel as well as the occasional heavy root that breaks through the surface of that soft floor there are some pieces of broken wood slats but besides that the chamber appears to be empty okay you're now stepping into the chamber the chamber's about 30 feet wide it's just round you look up the ceiling's about 12 feet tall and there's some hanging roots that are dangling from the top it looks like it's been carved away maybe no it matches the size it's probably about two feet to three feet of thickness of the actual tree trunk and the interior's hollow no make an investigation check if you want to okay a couple things though you don't have a sense of color-- are you the only one in the chamber right now you went in there as well right the rest of you guys step into the chamber and the light comes in what you failed to see because it was a change of color becomes immediately apparent there are scattered splashes of blood across areas of the walls inside they're dried but dried enough to the point where they haven't gone completely black and then disintegrated so this is relatively recent weeks maybe as you guys are inspecting the space there are certain gashes against-- it looks like there was definitely a fight and scuffle the soft ground here has signs of turbulent movement as well as a number of smeared grooves in the ground that snake and spiral about fjord as you're glancing about answering this question you look down on the far north corner of it and where some of the roots have gathered and come down there's one space where you don't see the wall of the tree behind it as you move the root out of the way there is an actual hole about two and a half feet wide that descends below the tree there are some spatters of blood and there are some things that give the sign of being pulled on as well as pieces and shards of wood including bits of porcelain some object that had shattered and broken looks like whatever may have been within this chamber at some point a lot of it's been brought down there make an investigation check you do manage to pull through you do see a small piece of thick scaled hide that was carved off probably as part of a scuffle it's pretty tough it's salty recognize any of the bodies okay glancing past and taking a look there's nobody that you've seen before that is amongst this crew they all appear to be darkly dressed generally to keep out of sight you do see two of the members there that have an accumulation of neck tattoos you've seen the ones back in zadash that were almost full bands of designs these individuals have only sections of it you start getting the idea that the more they've worked with whatever organization that work this is the more completion they've had of certain jobs depending on what the job is a certain type of individual acquires tattoos as a sign of how long they've been there and how successful they've been at one point possibly investigation check with disadvantage because it's quick what's that okay 13 you manage to scrape away about 17 gold pieces and five silver pieces before as you pull off of it you watch as the lower half of the body sloughs off the torso and you back away the smell is awful as a lot of the interior gas of the bloated corpse escapes into this terrible sulfurous stench okay you take a moment to focus and place your hand on this lightly thrumming device your vision is pulled into this universal space of stars and gas and distant existences you've never contemplated and there you see before you the pulsing light of possibility you reach out a hand and grasp it and feel it enter your body and you've acquired your fragment of possibility the hole has chunks of rock and dirt as well as a very interwoven network of roots coming down from the tree so it's fairly easy to climb down there is a little bit of that damp water and moisture that seeped into the chamber previously from just being near the swamp it wasn't a thick layer of water maybe half an inch or so in the actual portions of the chamber and some of it is now heading down as you're climbing down carefully through this hole you can feel it running down your back and it's this cold swamp water i need you to make an athletics check as you make your way down this chamber yep just add your athletics seven okay you begin to-- (grunts) and you lose your grip and begin slide down like a slide (impact) you get about maybe 15 or so feet before the back of the slide leaves you you have darkvision so you see the interior of some sort of chamber in the ground rocketing towards you-- okay and you gingerly land on your feet no damage taken and no noise made either looking around you you see the inside of a natural rock chamber you can hear in the distance a rummaging sound some shifting over from around the corner it seems like from where you're landing the back is around you and then it curves to the left you see a faint puddle before you lose vision and beyond that you don't see anything but you hear (shifting) just echoing around the side you hear a (monster hissing) something clatter to the ground what are the rest of you guys doing i don't think you heard anything no make a stealth check for me please you slowly make your way around the side this chamber appears to be kidney shaped it curves around the bend and as you make your way around the chamber at the outskirts of your darkvision you begin to make out three shapes humanoid torsos with long fins that extend from where the elbows are patchwork leather and bronze armor pieces as well as hints of shell jewelry and bone you can see one face as you peek around the edge and you can see this large toothy underbite with this square jaw where these four tendrils kind of dangle from the tip of its chin a single fin curves over the top of its head no nose but two gleaming eyes that refract what little bit of light coming into the chamber from something out of the visual range is giving off a faint glow the lower half of its body is a long fish tail it looks like that a nightmare-ish merman would look like it sits there clutching some sort of long harpoon-like pike with a hook on the end of it they're talking amongst themselves and you hear some sort of tearing sound you peek around a little further and you can see a creature has been dragged down here a familiar one a thick leathery-scaled body of a crocodile of some kind not a large one but a regular sized crocodile has been dragged down here and all three of them are in the process of feasting on its body they're tearing into its flesh and talking amongst themselves in a language you don't understand around the base of them you see broken crates and a few odds and ends are resting on the ground loosely discarded from what you can see you're kind of peeking around the corner you cannot see the opposite end of where this curvature is without possibly revealing yourself around that way not terribly there are a few outcropping walls and at this point i would say i could probably give you a visual nott you're right there curving around the side you landed right here and then made your way around this is where it drops you into the middle of the chamber okay so who's going down yeah they can most of them make an acrobatics check for me sure the cat's acrobatics frumpkin lands okay double knot all right all right you make your way down the rope eventually you get to the bottom it does dangle and the edge of the rope does basically end about a foot or two above where the ground is so you just manage to catch the bottom so put how many ropes together two 50 feet ropes oh so no it's actually coiled at the bottom total it's about a 60-foot way down you manage to make you way down without an issue okay so with the rope and everything aiding you down here it's easy enough for you all to make your way into this area kiri's coming down with you are you guys having this conversation (chirping) (like cali) i killed people (chirping) (like jester) don't move unless something chases you (like jester) right holds the dagger in front of her yeah so kiri is going to go ahead and duck into this corner here all right what are you guys doing nott you're watching you hear the splashing of water and out from the side another one emerges from this side pool it (speaking in aquan) the other one (speaking in aquan) it turns around and splashes back into this little pool and vanishes below the surface briefly chatting but in the process of eating more than anything it's about ten square feet everyone make a stealth check what was the number you rolled okay so that's six as they're all eating and nott you're paying attention one goes (inquisitive growl garbled speech) all right so you throw the ball bearings and then everyone rolls initiative you lost the surprise round unfortunately you were spending too much time talking 25 to 20 anybody 20 to 15 okay so we have beau fjord-- what did you get 18 and then molly at 16 15 to ten and then what was it caleb and nott all right ten to five jester and cali no kiri's staying in the back all right that's everybody top of the round as all three of them have spun around apparently aware that something is lurking in this area of it no but it's not an ambush round so top of the round is beau you're up you can't hold your turn you can hold an action all the bad stealth checks were-- ten right okay got it depending on what your action trigger is yeah over here next to nott yeah you can do that okay and you're holding your action in case fjord attacks something okay so as you're pulling back with that fjord all right well you're going to be out in the open just so you're aware all right so you move over here you can now see all three right there yeah that's as far as you can move there they all turn (growls) you see some of them holding what looks to be these large harpoon-trident things that are hooked on the end and they have some sort of thick cabling of some kind attached to the end of it 20-foot radius where do you want to place it you got it so you watch suddenly as the back end of that chamber-- well for those who can see which caleb currently-- it's mostly dark except for that faint faint glow around the corner that you don't see the source there's no light in here that light goes out you are blind at the moment because what little bit of light there is has been consumed by this sphere of darkness that fjord has summoned on the opposite side of the chamber you watch as reality tears open in that space and you see these strange black-purple otherworldly tentacles whip out from the outside of it and you hear this horrible slithering sound within the center of that chamber with this faint underlying of whispers and chanting does that do immediate damage or only on their turn cool all right so that ends your turn there molly you're up let me see here real fast about the hunger of hadar spell all right so you cannot see anything you have your goggles on-- correct but you have darkvision correct so i'll say you can see where they are but it's a little obscured so you are well no i'm sorry you cannot move you did your move so you have to have an action so you can only attack that one that you can see there okay they're at disadvantage because it's beyond your 20-foot initial range that does hit yeah nope disappears into the darkness you had to do that on your turn you've only got an action you were holding sorry it's about ten 11 feet it's not very high all right that ends fjord and beau's turn molly this one over here oh i see there we go you still have a bonus if you want to all right did you activate one of your scimitars got it cool that ends your turn it is now their turn so top of the round they're both in the space so they take how much damage 2d6 cold damage you do so roll all at once (laughs) you hear this strange slamming and slithering sound and hissing noises on the inside all righty so this one's going to go ahead and move just to the edge there this guy gets to about there actually before he can move into the water right now because they don't have a huge movement on land exactly so those guys are clustered there that guy does manage to move-- he's going to continue slithering the rest of the way (counting) i'll say it gets him to about there well it's not the end of their turn yet the two while still blinded saw you emerge the one over on this end is going to go ahead and attempt to throw one of its harpoons in your direction it's blinded so it has disadvantage on the attack with disadvantage that's a 16 what's your armor class aw slick it shoots through and you deflect it with the shield and watch it spark off the one behind it is going to throw as well natural one yeah it chucks the harpoon both of them land on the ground and you hear them scrape as they're pulled back to where they are the one that is right there in front of you is going to throw another harpoon it's going to throw a harpoon at you still at disadvantage that is a 20 to hit you suffer as it jams and pierces into your abdomen right past the armor sticking a couple inches into your chest you take 11 points of piercing damage and i need you to make a strength check natural 20 you get dragged right up into its space right there make a constitution saving throw to see if you can maintain concentration on your spell make a constitution saving throw so you succeed that one now it's pulled you in it's going to go ahead and make a bite attack against you as it pulls you in its jaw opens up to strike you that is an 18 to hit because you have 17 armor you take seven points of piercing damage as it digs its jaws right into the front of your chest and shoulder area biting down make another constitution saving throw you maintain concentration of the spell now all three of them have to make a dexterity saving throw or receive the damage again that is a fail a fail and a fail two ten and a three nice that ends their turn that brings us to yasha 40 you can't quite get up into his space you're ten feet away you can use an action to dash if you want to make the rest of the movement but you won't have an action on your turn if you don't take damage by the end of your next turn then yeah unless you move into the tentacle range you can you're going to hold for what okay holding your attack just in case it comes in range that ends your turn yasha nott and caleb you're up with jester and cali on deck okay does your cat have darkvision no it does not the first area but nothing beyond that space you got it beau has swollen to an enlarged state beau takes up this entire space now at a ten-foot ceiling beau you suddenly crouch you're now hunched forward with the top of it grinding against the top of your head and shoulders if he hits it's sneak attack he doesn't get advantage so it misses unfortunately 14 does hit it does yes 18 points of damage all righty that ends your turn yeah you can right over there jester and cali there there you go there you go all righty that's your turn jester about 30 about there all righty 15 hits six great it's poisoned until the end of your next turn as the bolt hits it the veins all of a sudden go dark on its torso where it impacts ending cali's turn beau you're up jester went she invoked duplicity enlarged beau is crouching down you can this giant foot right next to you nott as beau's large form almost stomps on you 16 that hits that misses ten damage with your staff as you rush up crouching low you take the staff and jam it down into it it looks back at you it sees you looming by as it pulls up its harpoon to try and defend you jam the staff into its chest shove it to the ground under the water and hear a crunch as you collapse its ribcage with the impact it's taken the brunt of your damage the harpoon fell out of the wound it's loose on the ground there's a pretty nice puncture wound through your armor and your body right there you sure can so you take it and you fling it into the darkness and it (flopping) you've already used your action to do your attack bonus action's an unarmed strike so this is a flavor as you throw it into the darkness that they can't see you hear its body-- you were but there was nothing to hit that's unarmed in your face you do fling it in there and you hear this horrible slurping sound as whatever-- and you were and whatever tear in reality that was opened by fjord's patron devours the corpse it's plucked out of the air and sucked through whatever small rip in reality had opened sure all right that ends your turn fjord you're up okay that ends your turn you did have a little bit more yeah you could have yeah you can scoot all the way up to here if you want you're squat-moving your way through the cavern molly what do you got you got it it's now their turn top of the turn they take 2d6 damage so go ahead and roll that got it you hear (snarling) and (slurping) sound on the inside of this darkened sphere this guy manages to get into the water and poke his way through but just barely get his vision out this guy's going to come out as well and encounter beau on that element they're both still inside they're still inside and another one arrives here and can only move there he will yes this one here is technically right in range of fjord and is going to unleash two strikes on you its claws and its melee bite actually i could melee with a harpoon so it's going to attempt to harpoon you and bite you natural 20 on the harpoon and then for the bite attack that's going to be a 23 the harpoon is going to be 24 points of piercing damage as it jams right into your chest pushing you against the wall go ahead and make a concentration check if you don't mind you have to beat 12 it's going to attempt to bite you in the face-- the bite it actually hit that's going to be a d8 that's eight points of piercing damage where did my dice go there it is no the snitch fell away i need to keep it it did all righty so make a second concentration check 13's fine you maintain concentration the other one that's right next to beau is going to attempt to also throw its harpoon at you since it saw that you were the source of this they're trying to break the spell you were holding an attack you'll have to say that— you're amplifying it okay go for it so roll the damage that's disadvantage on that that's a 17 to hit what's your armor class 17 it still hits the first strike the harpoon (crashing) into you that's going to be 12 points of piercing damage you can while this is happening roll a concentration check and make a strength check for me please 19 on its side you get dragged 20 feet through the water into range with it beau you make your sentinel strike on it natural 20 nice go ahead and-- the dice of the enlarged is also doubled too 16 points of damage crack as it gets cracked you watch as one of the teeth goes flying from the impact of your giant elbow hammer into its jaw using that momentum it looks back its eyes clenched down on fjord now almost prostrate before it holding onto the harpoon and goes for the face this is with disadvantage though that'll save you it was a 17 and a two it goes to bite you and you manage to pull up your sword in the way and block it its jaws open and this terrible fishing breath smell cascades over your face the one on the other end is blind it hears all this noise happening it's going to make a wide shot with its harpoon in the direction of where it's hearing all this conflict disadvantage 16 and 18 that still hits sorry fjord you take-- no those are the dice rolls that i was making it was a 16 and a 19 so that's nine points of piercing damage yeah you guys have done it before and with that fjord goes down and the spell fades it closes off they now have visual this guy's going to move no that was his movement that's right so he wouldn't move he went top of the round thank you for the reminder of that but he used his action to throw that so that's all he has that ends their go yasha you're up this one here all right in the water or on the side you got it going the full yasha angry nott and caleb you're up next 19 hits so the first strike with the divine 3d6 plus seven 20 points of damage on the first strike as you carve across its torso it hisses back still standing though that's 2d6 plus five five 11 points of damage as the first blade strike carves down its body it pulls back hissing fjord's unconscious sinking underwater with the harpoon still sticking out of his chest as it's leaning back at an angle as he vanishes into the dark liquid as it pulls back it yanks the harpoon from his body and you see his body slightly lurch up out of the water before sinking again it pulls it back to strike at you with it and when you pull the blade back you thrust it right into its chest and the light goes out of its eyes that's true you have the armor on he starts to sink and the body buoys itself back to the top it's the mariner's armor that he had the enchantment put over all righty that ends yasha's turn nott and caleb you guys are up against which one it is still up as it bursts into it the flames burn across its system but its body is damp and slick anyway so you see the dark black scorch marks but nothing more than that ten misses unfortunately hits the ground behind it or hits the wall burns across and vanishes across the rock that finishes your go nott you're up beau is that hits all righty as you fire this one it manages to pierce right under its throat and it turns back towards you and it grabs the harpoon off the ground as it pulls it back the blood's gouting out of a major vein or artery in its throat it tries to get the strength and as it does it pulls back and gets woozy throws it and it lands maybe two feet from where it grabs it and with a horrible gurgle falls to the ground it begins to slip and sink into the water disadvantage on this one though 15 hits nice that ends nott's turn are you going to move all right cali and jester you are conscious (gasping) you look up and see the faintly illusory image of jester holding you pop (singing) roll that attack roll that hits its armor class is 13 all righty that ends jester's go cali you are yeah 15-foot cone as the acid sprays out towards it it covers the area dex saving throw for the merrow as it tries to avoid it that is a natural three plus zero that's a failure nice as you finish spraying it down and all the flesh on the outside of its body is beginning to melt away and burn and bubble it (growls) it's pretty scarred from that immediate spray across the front part of its torso you see the eye gleaming still with the light spell all right that finishes your turn beau top of the round you okay all right as you go for the big sweep your staff goes (scraping) (thud) bits of rock and shale is being ground and falling all around you exactly a little snap at the end roll for the attack that hits roll damage 13 points of damage that's the first strike okay as you spin it this way it wedges itself from the floor to the ceiling and you have to like-- boom 15 hits ten points of damage whack you crack into it and it hits into its torso it looks like it's bleeding out of its mouth onto its stomach it looks really painfully hurt and its eyes are dashing around each way it looks like it's starting to turn its head towards the area where it emerged okay using a ki point 12 misses this time as you try to punch it manages to dodge the first one and the second time you go to swing one of the pieces of stone that had dislodged slightly from when you had impacted it falls and catches your fist in the middle of the air it shatters and causes this cloud of dust to cross the creature but your hand fucking hurts that's it end of beau's turn fjord you're up back to there yeah go for it that hits yeah roll damage how do you want to do this it's turning around and slithering away it's about to dive back into the water and probably disappear into a subterranean tunnel that's filled as you release your hand both bolts arc outward and slam into it from the back from the front perspective it would look like guyver how he tears the chest and the beams come out but instead it's its internal organs being shoved out into the wall and there's two open holes tombstone-style before it hits the water and slithers and sinks down into the small tunnel the impact hit it and began (sucking) we're out of initiative at this point sure make a dexterity saving throw to see if you can react quick enough sure it's less of a skill check it's more of a reactionary thing so you wouldn't be able to help with it five okay you're trying to reach it but it sunk too low you're hitting stone and then nothing just water below do you clear the water you do and you see that the tunnel curves below and evens out it sunk hit the bottom sediment and dragged a little bit and came to rest about maybe 15 feet below the surface you take a moment to dive under grab it and whether through a chain of hands or whatever because it's pretty heavy it's a large body probably weighs close to 800 pounds so you guys have to all together pull it up and it takes a few moments to do so but jester's pretty beefy between the two of you you eventually get it up back into the chamber at which point the friends spell ends and you can feel an influence that was previously there over your personality kiri comes around the corner with the dagger sees you all standing there (chirping) runs up to the body there and goes (dagger slice) (like cali) i killed people stabs the body a few more times okay who's helming the investigation okay an individual has to helm it all right caleb you're being aided so make it with advantage that wasn't cocked technically oh did it okay metal dice okay as you guys are rummaging through with caleb helming this section you're going through a bunch of empty crates partially destroyed crates pushing aside the mostly torn apart corpse of this crocodile and ignoring that you manage to find a number of gold and silver pieces that have been scattered and lost and fallen into the sand digging through the natural gravel and sand floor of this chamber you find that a lot of it has just been buried they weren't interested in gold pieces they weren't interested in money a lot of that was left behind and scattered and has been covered you take a moment to pull through and you manage to acquire 185 gold 210 silver pieces and 65 copper pieces correct you find a bunch of jewelry necklaces and rings that are thrown about and lost okay all the jewelry together would come to about just for purposes of resale 250 gold worth of jewelry there are no diamonds in there worth 300 gold sorry there are four sets of manacles the manacles are empty though they are bloody yes four sets of bloody manacles no these do not these are plain manacles roughly yeah there are a number of broken vials of some thick purple liquid but two of them are not broken you rolled really high on your investigation so two vials of a thick purple liquid roughly about that big it's a thick oily substance nott you see one thing helping caleb out and you pull it out it looks to be a well-crafted marble bowl of gold inlay of a curious design the edges of the bowl shift into five multiple dragon heads equally separated and in each dragon the eyes are tiny gemstones one set's rubies one set's emeralds one set's sapphires one set's diamond all righty make a sleight of hand check cali make a perception check looking through frantically you don't see anything there it gets about five or six feet deep make an investigation check with disadvantage there's one of them that was a three-pronged trident and two that were just long harpoons they're all hooked at the tips and they had this thick rope cable on the edge that they were using to pull them back in just a trident yeah no one noticed nobody noticed sure usually you got to tell me before you roll that's fine it's brackish and thick and you don't find much of interest you do find some bones looking through you find a number of discarded humanoid skeletons four of them to be exact fjord as they're having this conversation you feel this strange crawling sensation in the back of your head as you're looking past this pool down into the darkness below even though it's clear you can see the ripples and there's something gently tugging you in that direction and a familiar voice creeps in sourceless within your brain that says learn what the-- no short rest you can do as many times as you want yeah make a perception check you went all the way around the other side no there's no way the bowl is magical it is used as a communion device when granted with enough blood and given the proper ritual it's used to acquire auguries various bits of divination and communication across the divine gate with whatever this scaled tyrant may be it needs enough to fill the bowl some sort of communion that's all you can make out from it the vials are not magically enchanted hold on identify should-- okay what are you guys doing you're underwater fjord you're swimming down going through the darkness keeping your way there it goes under for about 30 feet 40 feet you're pulling your way across the ceiling as it levels out curves a bit straightens lungs start to hurt a little bit but you're still holding your breath okay pulling your way through this darkness you pull under and you're uncertain as to where it'll end and that brief little peaking fear in the back of your mind flashes and memories of being under the ocean of the shipwreck of looking up and not knowing which direction was up that gives you this brief surge of vertigo you stop for a second and a couple bubbles escape go ahead and make a constitution saving throw 21 you push through continue swim across swim learn you come up and all of a sudden you can see now it begins to rise up once more and you begin to swim up pull across the front and then suddenly your fingers break water but you do so carefully take a breath slowly as your head emerges from the dark water in what is a large darkened chamber make a perception check with disadvantage you see where this 15 20-foot pool that you've emerged from opens up into this chamber that is filled with low water and a number of divots and pools within the bars of land are limited and thin you see from the peripheral of your vision before it ends at that point roughly five or six more of these creatures you see a very faint glow in the distance a number of objects that are piled and shoved into a central place you see elements old pieces of stone structures that have fallen in this chamber inside here had a built or constructed purpose long ago and since has crumbled as the earth has shifted that's as much as you can make out okay cool making your way through now you know the path is there the confidence because you know there is air eventually helps you push through you make it halfway through-- it's about 15 20 feet you can see the bottom yeah you do manage to come out the other side emerge and take your breath now that you've been through it once and managed to go through it a little more confidently you didn't have to worry about holding your breath (jester voice) i'm so proud of you mm-hmm go ahead make a dexterity check opposed disadvantage for you because you weren't expecting it the bowl leaves your hand now beau's holding it no it's faded she's not being subtle you throw it on the ground it rolls off untouched all the acid runs off of it unscathed okay you're going to strike it as you're dispelling it is that what you're doing okay you hold your magician's judge up you lift it over your head and swing it down with all your might go ahead and make the check for the dispel magic on the sword it's under the description of the sword on your app it's a d20 plus-- not the attack roll it's under the ability yeah so roll and add three 13 as you strike downward there's a brief moment where you see a flash of energy as if the field is temporarily dissipating whatever magical connection this object holds in that brief ever-so-subtle instance of time in which this marble bowl is left in a brief blip in history it is exposed to the elements the blade carves through and shatters the glow (explosion) for that instance there is a brief burst of bright green blue red white black energy that emanates and this low growling rumble and with that the bowl and whatever enchantment it held is gone it's interesting as it shattered and while you're having this conversation there's this static electricity around yasha occasionally as she brings her hand closer you watch as these little bolts of energy are arcing through here as it slowly fades you can see there's a slight faint glow of the symbol she holds at her belt that eventually goes mundane as well make an investigation check to search for where the shards all landed okay cali climbs the rope with a brief glimmer of her feet vanishing into the tunnel above you all settle in to rest and decide what you're going to do with the rest of this chamber if anything and that's where we'll end tonight's game good drama it's fun oh man good game mark thank you for coming on yeah high rollers is great thank you for coming
