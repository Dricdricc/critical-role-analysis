oh hai adjusting our chairs the whole-- orderly calmly respectfully oh can we get some audio on that mic if you don't mind could you count down for us ten to one okay count down in the microphone for us we got it all right thank you i mean when the characters create their backstories and such i let themâ€“ they'll ask me some semblance of the world and you know locations and stuff and i'll give them some places they can pull from and they create from there background elements that's mainly their creation and then i incorporate and tweak things as it goes but as far as things that are coming up in the story no i want to surprise them as the character would know i mean if it's something that i feel needs to be a discussion i don't want to-- if i feel that it'll deter or alter heavily a direction they want to go with the character then maybe i'll be like hey how do you feel about me tweaking with something that you had already established but generally i want the character to experience it with the player and vice-versa so that really came to fruition with the briarwood arc yeah the whole orthax the whole smoke demon that was not converted it was just a dream of some dark entity that inspired him and everything else extrapolated from there good question which by the way just out of curiosity raise your hand if you've not seen any critical role or have any idea what it is i am so excited for you you're going to be so confused this entire panel it's going to be great but so you're aware critical role is a twitch stream where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors present company included play dungeons and dragons once a week so this is our d&d game where we roll dice and get really geeky (cheering) part of your role as a dm or gm is you're trying to ascertain the probable direction they'll take and prepare for that and then try and prepare for a couple of alternate scenarios sometimes they'll shoot close to one of those and you can tailor some ideas to make it work sometimes they end up going directly where you thought they were going and you're like yes then sometimes they'll go a complete 180 and you're having to fly by the seat of your pants there are a number of times that happened let's see well i wasn't irritated i was like all right this is where we're-- i'm never irritated by it yeah you were like well we're not going there we're not going there we're going there i'm like oh okay guess we're going there the whole intro sequence of them arriving at the city of brass the meeting of senokir as an npc that was all improvised that whole sequence i had nothing prepared because i didn't think they were going to go there i had a semblance of some things they might encounter in that area but i hadn't fleshed it out fully yet so yeah it happens often more often than you'd think huh that's an interesting thought i'd say probably kiritsugu emiya from fate/zero because he's a combination of a really awesome and powerful rifleman and assassin-type character but has some powerful self-altering magics and just has an interesting disposition and moral quandary about his character so he'd be a fun one to roleplay definitely good to see you man okay and let's preface this because some people may not have seen the battle royale on thursday let's try not to spoil things necessarily we'll try okay then do what you will i'll come dressed as paul bearer and be like one of you's going to die grog versus keyleth one night only the thing is with you as well you and grog both have the highest probability of taking down a single person in one round of combat you from anywhere on the map and between bad news and a well-rolled violent shot you could probably kill any member of the party except for grog in one hit that's fine you don't have to have it on you to invoke the pact (laughter) i appreciate the offer however i have played frozen throne and i know better i've seen what that sword-- no man i spent way too long getting shadowmourne okay i'm having flashbacks terrible flashbacks brian rewards sass hey what's your name spice spice oh man i have a few answers here because it's hard to put one in there allura is the most self-insertion character i have in the campaign that to me is the most true to myself gilmore is such a delightful character i love playing as him interacting as him raishan is such a delicious villain to play as yeah i'm not going to say much more than that raishan was an amazing villain to play so those are my answers (as sun tree) thanks kiki your head hurt (as victor) learn from my mistakes doing well justin how about yourself oh man that's a great question i'd have to say i was playing a dwarven fighter my first time playing a combat class because i was always casters named kradin grimthorne who i named the brawlers' league dwarf who ended up representing you guys after i kind of used that character in this one but it was just playing a really angry tough little son of a bitch at one point we were climbing down this big ravine where this magical tower was at the bottom that was in the recess to stay hidden there was somebody in there we had to talk to so we were climbing down this hundreds and hundreds of feet with our climbing gear and at that moment we started being assaulted by wyverns that had nested into the side of this hill as they start running out and swiping down and attacking the rest of the party is like oh my god we got to go and they're all climbing down quickly and trying to get down as fast as they can i was like no i think one of these can hold my weight i'm going to wait until one of them comes for me the dm was like okay you realize you're still 600 feet up from the bottom of the ravine and i'm like oh i know so i'm just holding my action and holding my action with my hand on the rope and one wyvern swipes in to strike i take the hits and i'm like i grapple him all right roll for it i grab on and i manage to get up onto the wyvern and onto its back and clutch it by the back of the neck and start trying to coast it into the side of the ravine to try and control it and knock it a little dizzy i proceed to roll really well then really poorly then really well and in the process both of us get bludgeoned by the side of the ravine within an inch of our life eventually getting it down to the bottom before the rest of the party i actually swoop past them and they're all screaming what are you doing i'm like doing what a dwarf does win i slam it into the bottom of the ravine and we both go tumbling over i have three hit points left it's on the ground going (snarling) it's trying to get itself back up and i walk up pull out my ax and i'm like i win shwoop and i took its head off as a trophy wore it on my belt for a while it got really stinky i didn't care i wanted people to see what i did that was grimthorne part of what helps with the training of an actor is really what we do as actors is the study of human beings and the study of the human condition the complexities of a person so coming to it from that standpoint when you create an npc you think okay what abilities they have what classes they are what their background is what faction they work for are they good are they bad what loot do they have that's the core skeleton but then you consider what are their passions what are their goals what is it they're ultimately trying to achieve and how far are they willing to go to achieve that then you consider what are their deepest fears what are the things that drive them to desperation what are the things that drive them to flee what are the things that drive them to discard allies then you begin to break down subtleties of their history and their personality really one of the keys you come to is even villains have a reason to how they got there really good villains are those that you can understand why they became villains it doesn't mean you have to necessarily feel bad for them but there is a throughline of going okay i understand why this individual became who they are many villains don't see themselves as villains they see themselves as doing what's necessary for the greater good and not realize the ramifications of their actions so honestly studying characters studying people and a lot of the basics of creating a character from a performer's standpoint can work really well with the creation of characters for your game that will feel more breathing and living and intricate in my opinion you need to talk a little closer to the mic sir there we go yeah you now all have the image of taliesin singing kesha to himself in his car (cheering) in the same way that you're saying i wish i could let go like we do other people will see you and go i wish i could let go like you do it's a good feedback loop and that just gets you a little more comfortable with the idea that sometimes that fear you have of people judging you one doesn't matter two isn't what you think it is and three it's a very freeing experience to just express yourself for the pure joy of what you want to express and at the game table remind yourself that the players that are there for you are there for you they're supportive of you and they're engaging in the same way you are if you're afraid about getting that intense about it just remind yourself that they-- one they will be blown away when you do manage to cross that threshold and two they're there to support you and want to see you get into it as much as you want to as well so you have to remind yourself as best you can that they're not going to judge you for it by any means they're there cheering you on as long as you put it back (mccree voice) oh you know what time it is (cheering) (mccree voice) it's high noon (cheering) (mccree voice) it's 126 well i mean things that you can consider for balance are if you're gaining attributes of whatever you've eaten does it replace the attributes that you've previously devoured so the adaptation could be you only consume and take on the attributes of what you've currently taken in that's a balance so it's more of an adaptation that switches as opposed to just a constant building effect or they could be temporary whatever you consume it affects your attributes for a short period of time and then eventually fades away so you could bulk up and get pretty powerful for a short time but you can say that if you consume more than three or four entities within a short period of time it could be damaging or dangerous to your health so considering those are possibilities as opposed to just being a character that oh hope you guys enjoy your longswords i'm just going to eat the world and become a god (laughter) i mean it's up to you working with the gm on what is fair and what isn't just because you devour the heart of a dragon god doesn't mean you now have the powers of a dragon god it means you have the potential to eventually unlock the powers of a dragon god so your journey could be learning slowly over time how to unlock those abilities so you grow with the rest of the party so yeah there are ways to balance it but the gm has to work with you on that and make sure that it's in line so that it doesn't feel unfair for the rest of the players but you still get to play through those narrative elements in a way that's fun for you and your character to progress thank you buddy yeah well sam and i had discussed taryon for about three weeks-- about two or three weeks in advance since the end of the conclave arc-- and the scenarios that his character had gone through that had led him to feel it might be necessary depending on how the conversation goes with the rest of the party of him to either stay or leave we had made this character as a backup just in case he decided to leave so we had met and we had designed-- he told me the theory behind the character of taryon and what he wanted to him to be and i told him well that kind of fits in with these classes and the one he liked best was the artificer he was like oh that sounds exactly what we're trying to do and so he's like i want to be a character that has very little real-life experience but has enough money to make himself powerful so he became the trust fund baby of d&d characters from a mechanical standpoint taryon without any of his equipment is like level two but put all of his equipment on and he's level 14 15 was our thought process behind it he made the character and had him in the wings and then based on whatever happened that episode it seemed that sam decided to leave and as such that very same episode we brought taryon in which i think was a little sooner than sam was anticipating you guys went there immediately and it was a good button for the episode good question thank you thank you for coming along with us to answer your question what happens if there is no right way what happens if every path is the really wrong horrible torturing way exactly and let that be a lesson to him it's a delicate balance being a gm or a dm it's creating challenge without feeling like it's unfair and not challenging them all the time because you want the players to also have time where they feel like they're having a good time or they're kicking ass and enjoying the battle as opposed to always being under the threat of constant bludgeoning death you have to find that balance i was about to say what if they get to the guilty person and the guilty person kills themself and they're found with the dead body of the guilty party with no way of proving innocence and they have another body on their hands to now have to flee the town and remember if they're always rolling well and they're always just blowing through every encounter throw a couple tarrasques at them (laughter) it's called teaching humility you look awesome by the way hello what's your name sir rob hello that's a cool question by the time we'd gotten over the edition transition you knew the characters so well and what those were you didn't need to-- happy percy is a bad idea that's usually how it works though in real life hello again lee hello my name's lee the briarwoods i've been sitting on since percy gave me his character backstory the minute he turned that page in and i read it i was like oh this is going to be so sweet when we get to it it's going to be so good the conclave i've been sitting on for about two years before i dropped on that because when i began to develop them-- my main reason for doing the conclave was i'd been dming for so many years and i just didn't use dragons this game is called dungeons & dragons and i never got around to really using big ancient dragons i've always wanted to do that because some campaigns ended before i could get to that power level i didn't want it being like oh you're fighting a baby dragon ooh i wanted big scary classic dragons but the campaigns didn't go on long enough or thematically the dragons didn't fit for it the villains and the world where they were it would have felt shoehorned if i put them in there so i was like i'm not just going to bring a dragon i'm going to bring all of them in bring one of each chromatic dragon i decided that would be a conclave but they would never work together what would bring them together it would be the one the dominant the alpha essentially which is the thordak character and raishan being the sly manipulator and the combination of those two would make it a tenuous agreement between this conclave i developed this and realized in order for this to be impactful it has to be at a time when they're at the height of their success when it feels like everything is fine and good so i sat on it and i set the scene i began to plant the seeds of its eventual release and then waited for them to complete a series of arcs that was amazing i'm sitting here like they're back in emon they had their celebration they were all lauded before the people of emon they were having a crisis an existential crisis of what do we do now what holds us together what are we what purpose do we have are we still adventurers have we done any good in the world i don't know what's going on to be fair so is most any adventuring party and i think you can all attest to that so yeah it takes a lot of patience to sit on a story that long i remember that episode when liam said that when he's like what are we going to do what's next i feel like there's no purpose i'm like ooh man give me like 40 minutes (laughter) the sphere thing is coming to fruition slowly now and i've been sitting on that since i was designing the briarwood arc that one i've probably been sitting on the longest yeah we'll see where it comes up hi christen you look awesome by the way player that's my class (laughter) thank you only for brian when i rolled the decks i was like i'm never putting any of this in a campaign it ruins the narrative then i rolled it on a random treasure table when they defeated thordak i was like (sighs) well it's the smaller version of the deck so it doesn't have the super world-ending cards still pretty awful usually it's laura or percy that investigates the treasure hoard first so at least i know a player with some intelligence is going to find it so that went well he rushed there first and rolled so high i was like well okay here we go well it's fine because his use of the deck in the battle royale was a safe place to use it and to learn that there are a lot of consequences or not he pulled the cards with no consequences exandria goes (poof) gone awesome well it's funny that you mention that not in a stream per se but years ago -- there's a long-running show in los angeles called dungeon master that was just that still going a lot of our friends ran it and so a few of us would be guests on it occasionally called adventure the three of us were all cast members we'd all-- every week was a different storyline a continuation of last week's storyline we all the cast played different npcs with costumes and set pieces and then five people from the audience would be pulled up as player characters the characters not the people none of this is legally binding you heard nothing erase the tape it was a lot of fun stuff yeah dungeon master is still running what's your question i was actually going to say that because he was planning to go paladin of sarenrae through a chance resurrection ritual the death of his sister and a spontaneous pledge he made as that process led his path entirely different to instead pursue the path of the raven queen this is the reason i love d&d you can't plan for that a couple of die rolls and a spontaneous character choices and an entire character's planned destiny that you thought they had goes in another direction and now you're following that element i thought was a really cool switch yeah that was fun that was definitely one of the big off-throws like okay well this is an npc that they probably weren't going to meet or if they were going to meet it was going to be much later and it was probably just going to be a battle but they convinced to join them they now have an actual arcane magic-using mindflayer in their party sure actually i've thought about this recently i forgot about it but when they were in the moonbrush in the feywild i was not expecting you guys to side with the werewolves you guys came in and fought and slaughtered the pixies that was fully improvised that was fully like okay let's do this you guys are going to kill a bunch of pixies against the trees oh yeah well pixies are generally not-- you hear pixies like aww that's so cute they're beautiful they're also kind of dicks most things that are fey are they are selfish little entities that expect things to work however they want when an unstoppable force meets an immovable wall those are a few examples there definitely good question audience it wasn't his drawing arm this is your other legacy firearms and prosthetics that's what percy has done in exandria well they're starting to it's going to take a while thank you guys so much for coming we are signing tomorrow at 1230 to 215
