ado let's jump in to tonight's episode of critical role [click tv static] [groovy critical role theme] yeah that's fine you'll be fine you gathered your things and went back to the open road where you headed to the crossroads did some trading through the evening jumped into a few old friends who were looking to rob you sent them on their way then continued northward until eventually you came upon the outskirts of the-- what was it-- silberquel ridge-- there we go brain not working-- to the gnomish city of hupperdook upon arriving in the city you took in the industrial sites the elements of it that are heavy machinery and the creation of new types of clockwork-based technologies the stacks of soot and steam sent outward the war machines being developed for use to the eastern lines where the conflict with xhorhas is now brewing you made a friend by the name of rissa who said in exchange for a round drinks in the evening would show you around the town for a bit upon making your way to the upper level you were given a brief tour of the vicinity which seemed strangely empty the streets very well decorated for some seeming celebration but nobody present as the sun slowly went down the town came to life as all the work whistles blew the sounds of merriment began and suddenly as the sun goes vanishing behind the distant mountains the golds and oranges and subtle purples of the sunset begin to take over the sound of music and laughter begins to take the streets so mighty nein what would you like to do right yeah like i said welcome to hupperdook well i mean what else is there to do for the night here but that there's nothing else to do you've arrived go and get your stuff somewhere and let's have a drink you owe me a round anyway yeah it's part of our culture our gnomish heritage why because it keeps us working hard every day sure maybe our general longevity for gnomes is a little shorter than most but what a life we lead she reaches out and she's leaning out the cart as you guys are heading through the street these kids run by with sparklers in their hands and she reaches out and plucks them from their hand and picks it up it's all (popping) around and she passes it over i can already see i'm going to like you folks that's the way we do here you can well in the tavern oh you can lock the doors because you put your lips to it make a perception check candy necklaces big giant pacifiers what you see is waves of fast moving families and people gnomish some dwarves a few human-sized folks rushing by it looks like some of them are rushing from work to get home to disrobe from all their dirty clothes and jump back out with their party attire or they're already on their way to wherever their destination is you hear fireworks going off in the distance and the occasional flashes in the sky but you don't see any vendors at this juncture at this point who's helming the cart and the horses okay rissa saddles up sits right in the little bench next to you at the front of the cart and takes part of the reins helping to guide you to where you're trying to get to go follow me tug to the right and it's got about two blocks down that way it's going to be hard to miss look for the large arch with the various spiraling ivy vines against it yeah make a perception check during this travel as you're keeping an eye out she seems to be just focused on the task at hand that's what it could mean or she could just not be trying to steal from you but it could be either you don't know after pulling around the side you come to this large celebration square where there are three stages set up there is a large maypole in the center and they're currently lifting up and tethering these large colorful streamers of multiple colors people are gathering baskets of flowers a few get tossed and you catch it and they're made of cloth you get the sense here that they don't have access to a lot of fresh flowers here in hupperdook based on the rocky terrain and the perpetual tossing of soot and ash into the atmosphere also if the celebration is that often they probably continue to reuse the same elements over and over again as you come over into this corner there are bands starting to play music being set up on the outside people are starting to sit down with blankets and families are starting to gather in this area to your left you see the large ivory archway with the ivy that's twisting across the top of it rissa reaches and tugs your hands to the left to gear the cart in that direction and goes all right blushing tankard right up this way there's more laughter and there are two vendors now on the outside one of which is currently selling flower necklaces or bands the other has clusters of sparklers and firecrackers you walk up and there's a young gnomish man in what would be the equivalent of his late teens or early twenties got a very prominent adam's apple and very thin for some of the gnomes you've seen around there he glances up to you holding a small barrel filled with various small-scale explosives hi can i help you three all right i'll just get this together well do you want three of everything or do you want a pack packs of ten packs for both of ten all right pack of each that will be five silver oh that's-- on the other side the next person over there a portly-looking fellow in his middle ages or so resting inside of his neck rescinded inside hi yeah the flowers are going to run about five copper per string so do you want just one he's got a bunch of them tied up in his hair and hanging off his neck braids are across the way over there cindy does the braids all right that's five copper thank you you're going to keep collecting pathetic characters to fight with you it's the best front line you can hope for (bouncing) you go back and look at it and you realize there is actually a tiny little fuse on it roll for an attack you don't even have to roll damage she tosses it in the air and it arcs this tiny little firecracker this little gray rod and then this little streak of flame fires up and hits it it detonates with this loud pop sound and you see sparks around it it dissipates a moment after and in the vicinity about seven or eight nearby gnomes two of which children all go (gasp) yeah start clapping and cheering ten so you have nine now well communally not much at all you make an intelligence check and have advantage because of your alchemical history yes you know it's had minor applications for a while but it's only really been applied in very condensed and common use for like the explosives you found in the mine clearing out spaces in underground caverns or for the detonation of localized rocks that are in the way of paths trying to be put in mountain ranges small scale black powder like this you haven't encountered really so this seems to be a relatively new use of this particular compound you've barely come across it at all you've read about it actually the dynamite sticks you found in the mine were probably the first ones you encountered in your experience not a lot of use for it in the small farming town of felderwin you have before but they're saved for very rare occasions like the coming of a ship that's been long gone from shore or particular times of the year for celebrations they would go off and for that in particular they would put ship barges out on the water and they would fire them up from the waterfront having it this close is intense and even that small burst right there there was a flash of heat that you haven't really had before and it's really exciting most everyone you see here is gnomish you've seen a handful of dwarves that's the next prominent people that live here and then a smattering of human and half-elf right now you guys have just come to the outside of the blushing tankard there is okay you guys leaving caleb and-- you're staying with caleb while he sets up the perimeter as you guys enter the blushing tankard tavern it is one of the larger taverns you've been in the floor space has 20 or so round tables scattered amongst the floor there is a stage in the far back where the music hasn't quite started yet but there are musicians setting up you can see a violinist who's currently tuning there is a piano in the back and outside a couple of taverns you saw in zadash and your experiences from when you were on the coast pianos aren't as common in tavern spaces usually reserved for the upper class for private performances or higher-end social events however the tables are filling up already people are rushing in there food is passed around left and right in the back there's a group of gnomes that are currently clapping the ground on their table singing some sort of tune a shanty one of them is up on the table clapping his legs there one of the barmaids comes by and slaps him get off the table what would you guys like to do all right okay go ahead and make a performance check there's a few moments of this going on before you suddenly hear this (throat clearing) you turn over your left shoulder and there is a half-elven gentlemen in a very nice doublet who is currently holding a handful of sheet music um you're at my piano he twitches at the off-tune hammering of the keys i'll be right back he turns around and wanders off for the moment clearing his ear with his pinky you guys go to get rooms you head to the front it's a very long bar that wraps around the right side of the entire chamber it has two hatches that can open up from the inside you see two individuals you see a male gnome with a massive mane of red hair clean shaven middle age and he's smiling and running around getting drinks sliding them down the bar filling things he's the gnomish redhead equivalent of tom cruise spinning the bottles and pouring them out on the other side you see a female dwarf with this awesome well-kept chinstrap beard who has beautiful eye makeup on and this very colorful silk billowing blouse that tapers at the wrist with a flourish she's currently filling out drink and snack orders and they're both workhorses they both have smiles on their faces and they're chatting with regulars you haven't quite caught their eye yet they're in the midst of other business a dwarf yeah for the hell of it both of you guys roll charisma checks please just roll a d20 and add your charisma modifier so the better part of 15 minutes pass of you guys waiting there and being overlooked until eventually the dwarf woman stops and goes all right sorry about that didn't see you there you're a bit higher than the usual folk what can i do for you both of those can be done lassie four rooms all right let's see then that's one gold piece per room per night this is the mini bar my dear but don't worry we can bring drinks up we can bring companions up we can bring what you need up just let us know all right but really fast sam and it's impressive a little off-key but overall impressive the speed of the composition right as she starts crescendoing about to get to the quiet part (speedily playing the entertainer) a hand slams down on the keys and that same half-elven gentlemen leans in once more and goes if i might please request my instrument returned to me my dear thank you i am i have a tipping hat he pulls off from the side this wide-brimmed hat that comes to a point in the front and floppy in the back and he sets it up on top of the piano well then i certainly hope the first few tips come while you're at the bench and he sits down at the bench and pushes you off of it i saw cracks his knuckles sets his music down in front starts getting ready the other performers to the side are watching this out of the corner of their eye and laughing they're enjoying the tension that's brewing you guys get your rooms situated as the keys are being passed out to the different rooms drinks are being handled so are you looking for something strong or something strong she leans into you and goes i like you you're colorful thank you first one's on me how about that hold that till later on that event's not till later tonight is this your first time here a bit well we have some performances going on and then we have our contest our weekly hour of honor so just don't drink too much if you're looking to compete she pops the top button off the top of her blouse and gives a better look at her dwarven cleavage i realized that i could do it as i was doing it as she does that she reaches down and pulls out a dark red glass bottle with a large cap which she pulls off this tiny glass passes it over to you and you look at it you're used to seeing liquid splash quite often this sloshes at a slower pace it's a thicker liquor it's surprisingly sweet strong the burn kicks in afterward you like it that's up to you would you like one of the same all right that'll be five silver pieces oh my goodness thank you she puts it in her cleavage pours you another shot of it as well hands it over all right it burns but it's good it's like a sweet thick honey liquor that coats the throat and the coating at first feels nice until the burn hits it's good yasha is with you but the player's in japan filming as you glance around yasha's sitting towards the back and towering over most of the clientele here and not necessarily uncomfortable but unsure what to make of the jovial atmosphere there is the faint corner of a smile but the awkward anxious smile of not knowing what to do and afraid to step any direction and crush somebody at this point rissa's like well if you've got your rooms taken care of we're looking for a place to sit then she glances past and you can see patrons are starting to get really rowdy they have these rope-hung chandeliers in three different spots and you can see one person is jumped up onto one and is hanging back and forth off of it some people are like yeah all of a sudden the dwarf woman at the bar goes oh for the love of-- clambers over with a speed you didn't expect from her rushes over and grabs the ankle and tears him down off onto the ground not in my bar are you talking to rissa i imagine if they're not paying attention my gnomish eyes spot what looks to be one open table across the way right there rissa points and you can see past the way there's one table that two people are just getting up from and leaving you and rissa go into a full run you beating her easily you get to the table and scoot into the side as she approaches you watch as two male gnomes intercept her and block her path one of them goes uh-uh sorry tinkertop table's not for you she goes fuck off fitz i've worked hard enough i saw this table fair and square the other one goes you don't work tabletop just like your brain-sick dad this table's for working folk fitz glances over and says go ask your pops to make you a table to drink at alone might buy you an hour before it breaks they both look wildly confused no no make an intimidation check as you lean forward in that tense glare a little bit of a liquor-based burp comes up abruptly and breaks the intensity of the moment oh someone's starting early not too bad no from what i've heard about these folks their blood's fire but on the inside they're nothing but cold and clammy he goes and flicks the edge of your nose these two little gnomish punks all right which one the one that just flicked you in the nose his eyes go black and you can see the bit of crimson pooling at the corner of the eyes he goes (stuttering) stumbles back and hits the stool and falls onto his ass what's going on go ahead and make a sleight of hand check you manage to pull six silver pieces and three gold pieces out of his pocket right now no strangely enough it's only money and only that amount the one that gets slapped in the ass by jester is like (stuttering) i apologize rissa we didn't know reaches over and goes and grabs the friend as soon as nott jumps on and starts thrashing around on him get that thing-- goes and pushes you off of its body picks up the other gnome at this point his eyes come back and the little strings of blood are curling down the side of his cheek he goes what happened they both just get lost into the crowd rissa looks over her shoulder at them leave and (laughing) me too indeed fitz and ashton they're both a couple of punks i've known them since i was a kid well tinkertop eh-- she curls into the bench around the table and leans one shoulder onto it my father's an inventor a tinkerer of some renown at one time he's had a rough few years that's just him being an arsehole all sorts of things toys contraptions occasionally whatever he's told to make by the starosta but he's just a bumbling twat really he's probably in nap time right now tomorrow maybe another round of just traditional ale drinks for everybody would probably run you we'll say three silver pieces as you guys gather around for a second rissa livens up a bit after that conversation but anyway you've asked me a bit about myself what about you what are you here for what brings you to this godforsaken place looking for work that's not the first time we've heard that i'm just going to call that unintentional ignorance but no gnomes don't live in mushrooms don't be saying that around here very loudly not all folks will be taking kindly to that she grabs one of the tankards and starts drinking heavily from it anyway the music begins to kick in even louder the celebration has kicked into a second gear here once i can find the music transition marisha and the crowd begins to hush for a moment from one of the back rooms a door opens and a range of brightly-colored gnome dancers come rushing into the room to a swell of cheers and applause you see four dancers emerge across the spectrum of gender and take to tabletops and begin to stomp and click their feet to the rhythm of the music the musicians begin to finally pick up and build the pianist you met earlier is starting to make his music happen it's beautiful and echoes through the room the placement of it you get the sense now whether it be some enchantment or some intentional acoustic presence in the room but the music carries well and seems to bleed from everywhere as the dancers are up on the tables these silk scarves rainbow-colored from their arms twirl into large circles and shapes and they have this worked out fantastic choreography in unison they begin to leap from tabletop to tabletop in a circular fashion making these large arching foot leaps and landing again folks cheer with each land the music whirring itself into a frenzy folks are starting to toss coins towards them on the table they in the middle of it will spin catch one and pocket it and move back into the dance you get the sense this a very practiced and fairly often performed as to how well-oiled this machine of a performance is snatched out of the air make a dexterity check this is going to be a contested dexterity check between you and a dancer as you reach for the coin your fingers almost touch it before everything goes dark as a wooden shoe-covered foot (slamming) across your face from the dancer who catches it between two fingers looks down retracts the foot and as you get your vision back and look up the dancer gives you a wink and goes back into a spin as the dancers begin to gather leaping from table to table they start getting closer to the center of the room they begin to spin together until eventually they clasp hands some of the bar hands grab the tables and start pushing them together in the center telling the patrons to step back a bit as they do the circle continues to get tighter as they leap from table to table holding each other wrist to wrist arm to arm as they do the silks are billowing out and you can see them extending the silks they've been holding seem to have been a bunch hidden within their sleeves as they billow out they widen until it's like a parachute of rainbow colors that just spin in this circle it completely engulfs them all you see is the tip of their heads within this swirl of color until eventually the music comes to a climax and with a heavy stomp all the colors fade and the dancers bow everyone in the room starts cheering and clapping (applause) the dancers smile and step off walking around with hats in the front taking tips from people at tables as they adjust the tables back to their original point everyone else goes back to their meals and you see them tossing the odd copper or silver piece into their hats kiri is off to the side (chirping) for the most part yeah as the evening goes on it tends to gather around the places where drink is running freely until everyone passes out then wakes up hair of the dog usually takes himself a bit of fuse and then gets back to work a fuse is the hair of the dog drink that we brew here to get everyone waking up and back to work i don't know how it's going to mingle well with non-gnomish tracts but i'm willing to watch and try me too (laughs) hour of honor look over there she points to the far wall and they're starting to set up lights on it these glowing lanterns they have on pikes it's a collection of wooden name plates she goes once a week there's a contest where the previous holders of the hour of honor can take challenges whoever provides the most monetary amount to the challenge gets to go one-on-one with their team drink to drink until only one's left un-puking or un-passed out the remainder gets the coin i think a percentage goes to the house and gets to take the title and a token that token is worth a free drink to each member of that team in this bar every night from what i've seen it can depend on if people are that interested or that competitive some folks put up the few gold they've earned for a few days if they're feeling lucky i've seen people put upwards of 20 25 gold sometimes which is quite a sizable sum i can hold my weight but i'm not much of a competitor if that's what you're asking you've probably been here for the better part of an hour or two just getting your paces having drinks and taking in the performances and the music i'd say you probably have another hour before it begins (like jester) i am kiri (like jester) yes i am very sweet (like caleb) doesn't matter though (like jester) okay (like jester) i know her rissa at this point goes well first off you're assuming they're all women i can honestly say i do not sorry as you approach the bar the dwarven woman who's in the process of cleaning a spill on the side looks over and sees you and does a triple-take like-- well would you look at this strapping mass of green and tooth (laughter) what can i do for you mighty forward but i can't say i'm not interested i've got a few more hours on my shift but if you hang around-- well it's been a while since i've-- she goes and starts pouring herself a drink how many three companions all right i have to go and connect with a friend here and see what's available but that's certainly doable well that depends on what you're asking for is it only for the hour is it for the evening what the requests are-- for an hour three that'd put you about say 20 gold i can do that yeah she's small i can hold her down it's awkward for me too good then you go out and have a good time i'll hold the bird down (like jester) i can send a message (like jester) okay i don't know if it's smart (chirping) she holds her little dagger in front of her (like jester) okay he's not going to leave his friends behind as you're making your way out the dwarven lass reaches out in your direction fjord to flag you down so just asking how soon are you wanting this companionship sent to your rooms and-- and her finger's playing with the front of your armor on the edge of the bar and goes i could give you a discount would you like me to cancel your request then all right i'll hold on to this until then well hopefully see you around gives a hint of grinning stink-eye in your direction jester and back to fjord take care of yourself lad at this point kiri who's not that far from you because you're still in the bar says (like jester) don't eat humans okay yasha goes i'm going to take her upstairs and heads off to the chamber there's a big bassy (impact) that you can feel in your chest there's a flash of color outside and there out maybe 20 feet looking up molly there's a flash of the firework in the sky going across his horns and form you walk out in this fair most people who have gathered here they're sitting there they're eating food and they're watching the fireworks as they go off there's a few folks out there candle dancers they have these light candles and it's this very slow meticulous dance they're moving in the darkest places of the corner and give this almost will-o'-wisp-type performance it's really enchanting and borderline creepy at times when you can't actually make out the forms of the dancer in the shadow people are watching and keeping an intent look on it otherwise the rest of this thoroughfare is apparently here though you're not sure how much businesses are open since most people are in the process of recovering from a day of business what do you want to do what else are you guys going to do oh yeah there aren't a lot of them meaning there's not an endless supply but you go back to the same people that are just up the road to the right from the outside of the tavern you can find the same two vendors you spoke with earlier make an investigation check and you make a perception check caleb was it a natural one oh so not quite a natural one you come upon a number of vendors that have already given out all their flowers so you're having a hard time finding anybody that still have any for sale in this main central area we'll come to that in a little bit okay good to keep that in mind as we move on you go back to those two vendors they're both set up on the side the one guy with the sparklers is still set up there and the guy with the fireworks is still resting there on the edge and the other guy with the flowers is set up on the side there's one guy with the sparklers and the fireworks who's there the thin somewhat dopey-looking young gnomish guy and you have the flower vendor who's slowly settled into himself like a barrel of a gnome hey welcome back i don't really have anything more powerful than these he's at this point locking eyes with you nott and there's like a look of recognition in his face i don't have anything of that variety i'm sorry sorry we're closing shop up for the night then he goes and closes up his little satchel and walks away at this point you guys are caught up with the rest of the crowd as you guys have meandered your way and look up and you can see the rest of your party has been wandering the street it's pretty damn good wine at this moment caleb in listening to this conversation your eyes focus on a sign post behind her on a building that reads bent binders no the windows are closed make a perception check as you look through the combination of the two of you eventually the glass fogs up and you can't see anything but from the brief moment you had on the inside it looks like there are a few shelves that contains some books it looks like there is actually a binding press and tools for bookbinding in there it looks like they have books for sale but it's too dark for you to see if they are blank or if they are actual books at the moment you cannot tell yet no just like christmas you must wait 'til the morning (laughter) make an investigation check taliesin and actually as you guys are fogging up the window you pull back and look to the left and you can see this adorable little gnome girl with deep tan skin her hair pulled in these cute little puffy buns in the side of her head and she has this little basket that is just filled with these different-colored silk-material flowers she's standing there smiling and you can see an older gnome sitting in a rocking chair behind her with a big old pipe coming out of his mouth as the hat is half-covering his face and he's just sitting there rocking next to her really hi oh my goodness thank you so much okay dad how much is a flower the guy sitting there rocking goes take them a silver apiece sorry copper yeah copper you will get ten flowers from me lickety-split she goes and takes out a handful counts them in your hand one two-- --three-- i am five yes he's a good dad what number is that what oh i'm very special too yeah the house is two buildings down that way and back one street you could see it has the red brick on the base by the door okay what's your name tara nice to meet you too there's this pause and she goes okay bye then runs back and goes dad dad dad and starts taking the copper and puts it in his hand and he's like oh that's a fine job he pulls his hat up a bit and takes the coin he looks over to you as you walk away and-- make an insight check seems like a nice enough dad yeah anything else you guys wish to do it's starting to get relatively close to that hour window there are crownsguard it's interesting because there are half and half for the large gnomish population here you see half of the crownsguard are gnomish and many of them have some form of firearm slung over their back and shoulders the other half appear to be human or half-elf the human/half-elf crownsguard appear to be less jovial and really paying attention to the chaos and generally trying to keep an eye out for anything untoward in comparison to the rest of the people that are currently celebrating yes but even the gnomish crownsguard seem to be taking their job seriously but they're still part of the event you get the sense here that everyone else gets to celebrate and party at this hour and they don't get to so they cheat a little bit honestly there's more crownsguard at night than you expected when you came into the city it didn't seem that heavily guarded but now they're out in a pretty serious force you gather probably a combination of there being wartime or because the nature of what this city builds as you're glancing out on the outside of the ledge of this upper area looking down there are a number of torches out by where the construction yards are down below either people are working through the night down there or there's a fairly heavy presence of crownsguard present around these partially-constructed devices and machines of war that you saw being worked on earlier in the day the gentleman who's selling the flower bands is sitting already smiling and goes-- yeah it has a few uses on it per day you guys return to the blushing tankard tavern the music's still blaring drinks are being thrown around a bunch of people are singing big old songs and clanking their tankards together and spilling onto the tabletops the floor is already slick with spilled liquor here and there it is a party that hasn't stopped since you left as you guys begin to enter the dwarven woman who you had spoken with earlier gets onto one of the central tables and slams her foot on the table everyone starts looking over and she goes attention arseholes might i have your leering eyes upon this supple and available specimen of a woman you hear some whistles oh thank you she bends forward with a wink to the crowd it's as you've all been waiting for the hour of honor yeah cheers clapping the tokens and titles are at stake ol' blemmy and his crew hold this winner's tokens for the last three weeks and she gestures over and you can see a team there mostly of gnomes ol' blemmy is this dwarf with one giant gash down his face and the snow-blind eye in that socket is sitting there with this tuft of a beard that has been so unkempt that you can't see his mouth it's this gray-black salt-and-pepper bush that disappears into a chin beard you assume he's grinning beneath there kind of yeah beard papa they're not willing to let them go who wants to put up their coin and their balls to topple these nobodies (chuckling) folks start standing up and tossing some coin on the table at her feet and shouting out five silver a gold piece three gold over here people are standing up and their groups are starting to get amped up and ready she's like keep them coming keep them coming whoa by the colorful newcomers-- hi there sweetie do we have more than ten gold here to try and take down these giants of drinking there's a moment and this one group in the corner these coal-smeared gnomes that come from-- you can assume now this is probably a heavy mining town they're sitting there with elements of their leather work clothes still on and they're all thinking and talking amongst themselves and they all pull in a few more coins and one of them comes forward still wearing leather gloves from the day and pops down 15 gold 18 he goes back talking to them comes back 25 gold pieces at that point everyone goes whoa with a flourish you place the rest of the 30 gold piece pot on the table ooh so turns back and looks back at the miners and they all go (heavy sigh) they gather their gold off the table back again and irena goes well if that's it it looks like our contenders for the night are-- (quietly) what are you called the mighty nein cheers and clamoring continue around and everyone starts shouting and yelling all right let's set up these drinks people with that final slam on the table she leaps off onto the ground and starts heading off towards the bar on the side the other bartender-- the gnomish gentleman there is rapidly clearing out tankards and drinks and he's starting to pull up bottles onto the countertop they start pushing tables into the center again once more as the crowds begin to circle around and ol' blemmy and the rest of his rather rough-looking crew that have seen some life in their time-- they're all pretty much gnomish middle-age which could be anywhere between 100 to 200 years old and you can see the weathering on their faces and their clothing they look like they nearly drink professionally they step up to the table and they figure out what order they're going to go in you guys figure out what order you're going to go in there's five on their team and talking to her a bit she goes all right there's five competitors you need to pick five of your team to compete who's sitting it out amongst you guys you need five yeah as you're coming down you notice jester the crowds are all gathering and there's this big circle appearing around the central-- they have two tables that are set up with a single bench each end you can see a third table behind it where there's probably going to be the dwarf woman overseeing this venture you do see this little gnome girl that's walking through the crowd and her hands open and people are-- it's not tara actually but it's a rather dirty-looking gnome little girl who's thumbing through and getting pushed around a little bit her hands are out in front she takes it and thank you barely audible voice and continues wandering in the crowd so the five of you guys are doing it sam taliesin travis marisha and at this point the dwarf woman comes back to the top of the tables there looks out all right friends i am but your humble evening mistress irena clommop and it is my pleasure to present to you tonight's esteemed head-to-head drinking battle between ol' blemmy and crew and the mighty nein first up of blemmy's crew we have duncan you see this one gnome gentleman come forward patchy beard more of a stonewall jackson type missing the centerpiece there his eyes are bloodshot and red his hair's slicked back with some sort of a thick oil and he's wearing a leather apron over a white stained shirt with the sleeves rolled up past his elbows he sits up gets on one end of the table puts one hand on his tankard and is waiting for his competitor and on the mighty nein's side who's competing against old duncan what's your name molly all right so we'll take turns she grabs this small barrel-- it's a handheld barrel-- she pours both of your drinks to the brim when i clap hands together you both drink it's not first to finish but it's one drink after the next first to pass out or lose their drink forfeits so with your drinks full let's begin with that i need you to roll a constitution check roll a d20 add your constitution modifier you watch as duncan takes it (gulping) you're drinking it and getting through it fine you're partway through your drink and he's already finished (slam) on the table it was a natural 20 on his end you finish the drink and you're like (burp) a little effervescent but it's there so that's one loss on your end how the rules work is that the first to three losses is the one-- in these competitive spaces no that was just how fast he finished the idea is you both make competitive constitution checks and the first to three losses in that competition is the one that either barfs or passes out yeah essentially at that point as soon as you guys drop the drinks next round fills up both of them the crowd starts cheering go ahead and roll he rolled a two plus two so four this time around you manage to finish a little sooner than him you put it down he's like (burp then chuckling) roll again fills up for the third round you finish your drink a little bit sooner than him plop it down (burping grunting) from behind him you hear ol' blemmy go don't you lose it boy a voice that grates like it's been slammed across a hundred years of seawater roll off again you finish your drink he takes his next one pops it down and you both stare for a moment (coughing and spitting) down the front of his shirt the crowd's goes like no tries to scoop it back up and they're like no and you're out irena kicks him out of the chair and he's done first round goes to the mighty nein he gets off the ground dazed you are fucking drunk molly he topples back to you guys you see duncan get pulled back in the crowd and ol' blemmy's like (inaudible muttering) and under his breath you can hear a string of curse words next up we have ruth you watch as this rotund tough-looking oval of a gnomish woman comes up there her hair pulled into really tight braids in the side with bright freckles and this grimace this woman has seen some shit and lived she gets up to the side takes the same tankard and goes i'll show you how it's done duncan fill it make a persuasion check with that the crowd starts picking up on beau and the name beau beau beau begins to resonate through the crowd you lock eyes with this gnomish woman and you can see there should be color but the irises are gray-- slate gray-- and it puts you off there's this intensity to her that you're like oh this is-- go ahead and roll no but people are definitely invested in this victory go ahead and make your first roll you both chug slam it down at the same exact time both hold tight it was a tie they fill up the drinks and next round go roll for it you both (gulping)-- you finish just before slam the drinks down (heavy exhaling) that's one victory on your end there roll again this time she doesn't even break eye contact with you she tilts to the side (fast gulping) finishes it in seconds and slams it down (heavy slam belch) and burps in your direction while you're still drinking and it catches you that's a loss on your end yeah next one nice rolls these are not saving throws right this is the actual check got it on that as you both fill this next set of tankards you drink and you finish just before she does both slam down and she's starting to have to tough into it you can see her grinding her fingers into the woodwork this is a lot of drinking that's two victories to you one victory to her fill up the next batch the crowd's still shouting beau beau beau next roll this time she toughs it in she grabs with both hands and chugs it down the foam catches the corner of her mouth and she finishes it and she wipes it off and sips it off her finger that's a victory on her end you guys are both tied the next roll's going to see who takes it beau beau beau her left eye's twitching as she's glaring at you she did with that you both chug maintaining eye contact you get partway into it and then (coughing and retching) and you begin backing up into the tankard you try and pass it off and then as you drop the tankard to gather yourself (spitting) it sprays onto the table oh the whole crowd worked up for beau's victory falls into a series of sad awws ruth finishes her drink sets it on the table and (teeth sucking) turns around and goes back next up we have valkin you see now this very young-- looks like the runt of his family line of gnomes-- comes forward looks very thin bright-eyed and very stark contrast to the rest of them as he gets closer to the table and sits down who's my competitor puts out a hand caleb it's a pleasure best of luck may the best gnome win yes as you guys gather the crowd begins to pull in a bit the evening mistress leans down at you and goes don't worry lad i can see you're nervous but just let the throat open and take it in leans back and first batch go roll off oh shit unexpectedly so little caleb finds his taste for alcohol in this one and with but a moment's notice downs the entirety of his glass finishing it before valkin does who says oh well done that's impressive fills both of them again next round go for it your confidence overtakes you as you go into the second round of cups and you manage to finish but you have to stop halfway through you have to actually go (heavy breathing) for the second serving you take it down and finish it however as you pull your glass down you can see valkin's there leaning i can tell that well done well done their drinks are filled go for it both of you guys make individual performance checks he does not seem to be distracted unfortunately what did you roll as you take a moment and (grunting and huffing)-- you manage to finish the last bits of it and it takes a moment you can feel all the suds of the mixtures of drinks you've had tonight billowing in your stomach and churning you hear the (gurgling) in your stomach you're like oh that's not good that's a second loss on your end they fill it up next roll 14 with this you see valkin-- he rolled a nine plus three so you win this one he goes and takes it finishes it you both within a second of each other finish the drink and i got this you got this i got this no don't don't touch ah no don't do it please fill up the last batch you guys both final roll natural 13 on his end with that he finishes the drink and goes told you boo yah gets up from the table turns around and (thud) faceplants right in the ground crowd goes yeah caleb pick him up you pull your way away from the table success is yours that's now two victories on your end one for ruth there and two final competitors second to last competitor the powerhouse the walking brick herself tanya this dwarven woman who looks like rosie the riveter on steroids comes around the corner she has her sleeves rolled up past the deltoids she has these massive hands with a bit of the dwarven hair gathered on the outside of the forearm big square jaw missing the two front teeth and she grins as she sits down she has most of her hair up and tied into this cloth she got a bit of the coal smears on her cheeks ah evening to you oh like all the time you well good luck then i'm happy to see how long you last big boy fill it up they fill the drinks take your first swig there you both finish neck and neck but you still manage to get it down faster as you both stand there she looks at you with a nod of being impressed not bad not bad oh we've just gotten started fill her up fill the next round she beats you with a 16 as she goes ahead and finishes off sets it down and just waits for you to finish fingers crossed and goes cute cute not as strong as coming out of the gate is that all you got you going to lose the wind in your sails there green boy you hear this voice go ah ey ey he's mine they fill up the two drinks make a deception check eight you manage to do so she doesn't seem to be paying attention to you caleb you're getting really nauseous watching jester do this little dance off to the side make your roll no shit okay that's two victories to you one victory to her with that one you finish it abruptly slam it down and you're like oh you're actually gaining a round that weird swirling in your stomach has faded and you've come into your own in this game she's looking-- you see the sweat appearing on her brow she's like that's okay there's more where that came from fill it up i got his number come on make a roll off what the shit and with that tanya goes down she gets halfway through the drink before no sorry and looks back towards ol' blemmy before she leans forward and stumbles out of the chair one of the other people picks her up and pulls her to the side and ol' blemmy's just sitting there fuming she goes and with that it looks like ol' blemmy's team has fallen that's three victories--  at which ol' blemmy puts up a hand and goes not yet i haven't competed one of theirs hasn't competed how 'bout we make a deal last fight double or nothing they look at each other going i think that's a little rich for our tastes who's going to come after me then okay this this is what you bring before me as an offering i'm going to crush you little green one it's great when he talks you see the bristles of the beard-- you can see as the evening mistress up at the top goes all right looks like we're going to get to see ol' blemmy strain through his baleen after all get to the sides of the table let the whale take a drink marisha and the dwarf sits down his mitt completely encompasses the tankard with his giant dwarven hand against ol' blemmy we have otto and drink pours the drinks make a roll are you going to go with it 17 you both chug down you manage to finish quickly slam it down oh this isn't as bad as you thought you've have much harder liquors than this the froth is filling at the edges of his mustache and as he pulls it down there's a coating of foam from the drink resting there a tongue comes out of nowhere this cousin itt broom-like beard the tongue takes the suds in that was a victory on your end next batch make the roll 18 that's pretty damn good ol' blemmy finishes his drink that's two for two victories on your end there he's not had the best luck rolling these last two rounds he finishes it down you're small but i can see why they call you the bottomless pit he grabs the barrel from the person and fills his own last tankard hands it off let's go take the roll if you really want to sure so you're like ah catching it underneath the crowds like yeah clamoring go ahead and make your roll as it's coming down it's splashing on your face a bit you're trying to catch it all you manage to catch most of it and you finish it you realize that the liquors that you've been having are not been mixing well with this particular drink you're starting to feel-- oof that's a victory on his end all you hear is this subtle (chuckling) roll for the next one no but you're blessed all right make your roll he rolled a natural 16 with a plus four modifier that puts him at 20 (cheering) travis and as you both finish the drink everyone is like yeah oh-- the whole crowd backs up for a minute ol' blemmy leans forward and goes wait a minute are you a fucking green-- and passes out on the table the saliva pools before him the crowd goes wild (cheering) oh it get you free drinks here for the rest of the week or until someone takes it from you yeah cheers go up there already there's somebody off in the corner who's whittling a block of wood and carving the mighty nein into it to put on the wall the rest of ol' blemmy's team begrudgingly come up and drunkenly pass forward their tokens and pass them over to you you have five drink tokens five of you can drink for free at this bar it was double or nothing so that's 60 gold they end up having to pony up the rest of it there's a 20% cut for the house though so that's 60 gold losing 20% of that that's 48 gold go back to you guys okay everyone claps you on the back and starts cheering and shaking your hands and stuff oh that was amazing we will in the morning well if you're looking for a meal--  i have a friend who's an herbalist who has something could help with that oh it's up third floor there's a bit of a water closet just aim for the hole please you guys are trashed i'd say you take a hit point nott you are intoxicated you are fearless in the midst of everything dying down people are starting to get pretty sloshed and the energy level while still rather rowdy some folks are starting to tap out for the night jester drags caleb into the center of the tavern floor takes hands and caleb almost running out on autopilot who does have some minor experience in the past go ahead and make a performance check with disadvantage caleb disadvantage because you're drunk caleb a moment passes before jester begins leading you but you guys continue the two of you to have a very nice little waltz in the middle of the area quietly the music begins to change what was once the rowdy bar music transitions into an actual waltz piece as the musicians notice this happening the three fourths begins to pick up one two three one two three as you guys continue to dance a few other couples begin to get up and start faking it they don't seem to know but they're watching playfully making up their own waltz-type maneuver an impromptu half-assed waltz begins to develop here in the center of the tavern you guys begin to join this as well which one of you is leading molly's leading nott's at his beck and call as you guys begin to dance around in a circle beau and fjord you're drunkenly staring at this oh that's right you're still upstairs fjord is passed the fuck out upstairs jester goes and tucks caleb into one of the rooms in bed comfortably are you going to amplify it or not make a constitution saving throw beau yes you manage to sober her up a little bit but you're still pretty tipsy from going blackout drunk you're now heavily buzzed and right at drunk what's interesting is as you finish this out of some of the pores the actual alcohol is drawn out hovers in the air for a second before dropping on the ground oh no no not like that laura and do you leave fjord in the bathroom okay you guys all make yourselves back to your rooms as you check inside yasha is asleep in a corner there with her sword at the side ready curled up against her chest is kiri also asleep bundled up a little bustle of feathers you guys eventually find yourselves to rest for the night sleep long arduous morning comes to as the sun comes up through the windows the sound of distant wandering roosters crowing at daybreak break you into consciousness the hangovers are real beau's doing okay there's a little bit of a hangover but not too bad jester's totally sober yasha's sober jester as you and beau start to get ready you guys start gathering your things beau your coin purse is missing (gasping) you still have your money on you make an investigation check you spend a few moments looking around and it's nowhere to be seen in the room all right is everybody else waking up no nott molly fjord your coin purses are gone and we're going to take a break your books are still with you your diamond you keep with your components that wasn't missing it was just the coin purse missing we're taking a break hold it (laughter) and welcome back returning to where we were the mighty nein coming to consciousness most of them with a roaring hangover have come to realize that all of their money has been pilfered other than jester and yasha everyone else appears to at some point during the evening lost their monetary gains as you guys are finding this out what do you do kiri is with yasha (chirping) (like jester) go fuck yourself to your memory they didn't shortly after the competition tucking their tails they went to find another place to drink and not have to be in the eyes of people that watched them lose you guys head down to the bottom floor of the tavern and it is empty from seeing it so busy the night before it is just 20-odd empty tables there is irena at the bar who's currently sitting down in the process eating a sandwich probably looking a little hungover herself sitting at a far table in the middle of cleaning out her fingernails is rissa you walk up good morning you're all looking appropriately fucked what can i get for you breakfast can be done let me grab that sid sid more breakfast no why did someone take all your money last night if you're not paying attention and you have a lot on you well that's your own fault i don't know anyone particularly but it happens sometimes that's why most folks that go out only take a few coins with them if you're walking around with a bank in your pocket i mean you're asking for it you turn around and the cart is protected there are crownsguard that patrol the main area it's not as busy as it was last night of course it seems they come out in full force a lot of them seem to sleep during the day and then come out at night to keep watch because that's when a lot of things happen but there are a few there's one that's posted on the far corner it looks like nobody's messed with the cart because it is out in the open are you referring to-- okay so you've exited the tavern the food is being brought out to you slowly over the next 30 minutes or so the crownsguard looks to you he's human a bushy not really well-kept blond beard morning you all right there buddy i can see you're newcomers to the town then you don't say to conspicuous folks maybe it happens every now and then we try and keep an eye out there as with any place of business there is always going to be some element of theft nothing we saw out of the ordinary but we can begin to investigate if you like you are profusely i can't say there's a specific region if anything the workplaces here are not teeming with that element the industrious nature of the city keeps itself busy in a very visible place perhaps somewhat here in the idleworks shelf there's the residential areas of silver falls those are probably the more likely areas i wouldn't look in the lower half up here in this shelf and beyond would probably be the most-- are you sure i don't mind i could probably keep an eye out is there any information you have about these individuals who robbed you may be yeah i think you should go do that you too he sits back into his post looking a bit confused i don't know what you're talking about which little girl oh yeah the beggar she comes in every now and then some folks help her get along not that i've seen she's like a waif what're you talking about make an insight check i mean as best as you can read she seems to be forthright as best as you can read okay so what's the saving throw on that what's the dc no she fails she goes like what's going on because if i recall yeah she is aware of the spell she's like what sort of trickery are you doing here i don't like this i'll ask you to leave there are many shady figures that come through here it's a town there was a lot of people here last night i know you're asking me-- look i'm a shady-looking character sometimes as well i can't pick it there's a lot of hard-working people here i did not steal your money no i don't know who stole your money i don't know you damn well pissed off ol' blemmy he's a possible one otherwise i don't know if anyone got too friendly with you last night i mean you've got to get close to take your money i didn't send any people up to your rooms because you told me not to pay for-- i was holding your cash which i've still got by the way and the offer still stands but-- i don't know probably rissa comes up i can help you not personally i'm sure there are folks out there she rubs her temples and you can tell she is a little hungover herself too she's like no i saw them come in at one point but then leave when they noticed i was still hanging with you folks so thank you for that i appreciate that if all the rest of you are in the area if anybody else steps into that zone you have to make a saving throw make a saving throw charisma right yeah you resist it rissa goes i mean it's possible i imagine people are distracted they're working hard they're having to push out double time in a lot of their work to get things out to the front lines it's possible they are but they're wooden and a little bit bigger than an actual gold coin yes what you asking no it's just me and syd at this point syd brings out the last of the food the male gnome who you saw when you first entered he's like so all of your food is ready enjoy through a friend of mine why are you asking me all these questions i didn't send anyone up to your room and i'm not going to spill all of my business propositions your direction not really lass no she nods and takes another sip of her morning coffee and goes aye they're about two blocks down from my father's shack a couple of kids that-- although at this hour they're probably working at the anvil i don't know i haven't hocked stolen goods around here i'm sorry to which one you have both rissa-- what of the band here he has a room on the third floor he was weimar she's like oh all right fair warning-- pardon me rough morning so where are you wanting are you looking for the boys the steelbringer's forge first or going to my pop's place okay follow me she gets up and finishes her coffee sets it back down and you guys take whatever scraps remain of your breakfast and make your way back out into the street both i'm a businesswoman but i've got my needs okay so you cast it you're in the tavern you're not getting anything in the town getting the cart around can be a bit of a pain it's comparable but you also have to deal with a cart rissa leads you further through the shelf at this point once again the town is fairly quiet and most folks you do see in the street are in the process of carrying supplies there are a few horse-drawn carts that have stacks of metal ingots that are being taken from above or below or vice versa you can see partially made metal plates and curved structures of larger things that are being developed and created separately and then all being brought to a singular location probably down near the artillery yard it's a very interesting black and white day and night separation of how the people live in this city a short jaunt around probably the spell does fade before you get there but you're still not picking up any blip about a few minutes after the spell fades you get to the outside of a small shack it's got metallic siding there are rivets in it you see it has a roof that is metal sheets there is a smokestack on top that's giving out this lazy smoke drip that makes its way into the sky and a sign out front that says tinkertop inventions marisha and she goes (sighs) rissa rolls her eyes and knocks on the metallic door yes come in dad it's me i have some friends here they just want to say hi they got thieved oh that's all right come on in certainly (sighs) she opens the door and on the inside you already hear the whirring of hundreds of tiny clockwork objects on the inside you can see wall to wall clocks of all sizes some broken springs exposed some that are fixed and clicking away some that have small sculptures that move in a circle around a central area you can see partially made pulleys small toys that are set up on the corner some wooden some metal and all of them have some sort of built-in clockwork locomotion to them though they are currently still there are two sets of lanterns that are hanging in the back giving the faint light which is as you enter giving this dark silhouette to a lot of these objects but as you walk into the light and look behind you you can see the detail work in them and they're very beautiful and very well-made it's at that point you hear a (crash) ah ugh you glance over and you can see hopping up and down running his hand like this this older gnome character with patches of white-gray hair this big bush of a white beard it's well-trimmed up here and then comes to a point at the bottom very large spectacles with a number of smaller and even smaller lenses in the front of it he's currently wearing a leather apron and sleeves that are rolled up and one of his hands is currently now bleeding on the edge and he's like (distressed noises) i'm terribly sorry about that come forward she said you're the friends of my lass there how are you doing what's your names oh did you dear that's so nice you're making friends rissa's like dad please stop it look they just wanted to come by they had some questions i think do what you're going to do please so we get going the boys she mentioned earlier are a few blocks down or a few buildings down and up from where you are well at the very least let me introduce myself i'm mastermaker cleff tinkertop cleff creator and experimenter of all things metallic and clicking thank you so much i appreciate that so yeah what can i do for you what's-- you look over and yasha's still behind kiri (chirping) he's like that's a mighty big bird she leans forward looks up to him (like cleff) she's a mighty big bird he's like that's a nice trick on that one i like that do you like-- and he pulls this small contraption it's actually a miniature version of what you saw those large bolt throwers that were constructed out front where it has this bowed arc and there's a small blunted stick in it he goes all you do is pull back on this trigger ping it fires off narrowly missing the side of beau's head hits something and you hear glass shatter in the background and he goes oh maybe not that one puts it back (cranking) and hands something over to kiri who accepts it there's a moment where things are awkward and there's a tension and you're about to go-- before it opens up and from the inside you see this tiny metallic bird its wings flap up and down a music box begins to play (metallic song) and kiri looking at this begins mimicking exactly the sound of the music box (metallic song) it's almost one beat behind it until it synchronizes and she's mimicking at such an incredibly fast pace behind it that they're almost in unison until eventually it slows down and comes to a stop kiri looks back to you (chirping) oh that one it's a beautiful piece i'll be happy to let it go for about three gold pieces there's a whole smattering of cool contraptions now that you're looking at the back too some that look like they could be armaments almost some that look like they're the insides of larger machine pieces ah proud of now i have one thing i'm working on if you want to see it okay i've been hoping they'd pay attention to this since the whole war's going on i think it'd be quite useful i've lost some good favor with folks in power but i hope maybe this will turn my fortune around he goes around off to the shelf and pulls this down and a bow of some kind that's affixed to this large device it looks like a crossbow but it's got a heavy crank on one side and it has all these extra grooves put in where it's easy to assemble a bolt in there the actual shaft of it is made of this polished treated wood with metal casing where the grip is it's like a half-clockwork gear-based crank hand crossbow well you lower the bolt into here and you crank it back real fast and it's like (squeaking) as he cranks it i probably have to oil this crank it then you just release this one goes just parting caleb's hair into the roof above well this one you see i had a friend of mine go ahead and help prepare it with some magical enchantment i call this one the tinkertop boltblaster 1000 this one runs just over 2000 gold well it's my prototype so if i'm going to let it go rissa's like dad they don't want it it's fine no one wants all your bullshit please you wouldn't say that if you'd known what some of his other things have done he gets quiet for a second and recoils quietly hurt he goes it comes with the job sometimes not everything works out like you hope uh-- and rissa's like ah it's-- you don't have to answer him we can go find the boys it's all right make a persuasion check 20 you see his trepidation there and he goes you look like you've got an honest face so i was working on a job here for the wardens of the gearhold prison down below i was helping them and came up with at their request what would be a clockwork warden something that could help keep watch over some of the more dangerous and difficult inmates of the prison below and i did it i was very proud of it on its first foray it had some faults i didn't see coming and we couldn't control it it began to just destroy whatever was in its way more or less they tell me they keep it down there still they've sealed it off and it's been there for the better part of two years and every now then they like to remind me i didn't mean anything bad by it i was just doing my job and i thought i was very proud of my work i didn't see the problems there i was just trying to help they come by and tell me thankfully not many i'm still paying off my fine they were going to try and destroy the thing but unfortunately they've had to allocate their attention to many places and now with the war coming i don't know if they'll ever get to it but as long as it's down there it's a black spot on my name and her name rissa goes dad just please stop it i don't want to send any more people to their death at the very least good for you a learned lesson for the rest of you i'm very proud of you i mean that sounds very kind of folks that wandered in here naught but a few moments ago oh i don't want it back i just want it gone i want it destroyed i want it taken care of and buried i don't want to touch it you i don't think it could be used for anything but just killing what's in front of it right now from what i know you'd have to go ask the wardenhelm i don't go down there places i mean i can't expect you to do something like that it's very sweet of you to offer i mean in a theoretical space which is where i live most of my days if you were to put this blight to rest i'd be happy to give this to you free of charge and my thanks i don't-- i don't delve in those places i'm sorry i don't know what's going on i deal with more detailed arms if you're looking for simple you're probably going to go to the steelbringer's forge rissa goes that's where the boys will probably be that's where they work thank you very much i'm always looking for fine oils clockwork tends to need to be lubricated that's all right don't worry about it that's okay if you come across some oil i could use it rissa i like your friends she's like thank you dad have you found work yet no dad i'm working on it right i'm working for them good good proud of you oh no it's still a living that's more than some folks in the empire can say any good gnome is incorporated i mean that's a cultural thing 13th birthday they get their s corp set up it's great (laughter) of course i expect nothing i really appreciate you being so kind good luck take care of my rissania she's like-- you can see her shiver at the door and then just run out goodbye take care (ping) something shoots off oh damn it as you all leave and exit out she's out there fuming outside he's something he's certainly something okay you pocketed a bolt marisha taliesin and right come on i'll lead you over to where the boys are you going to rough them up again right just right around the corner come on i'll show you aye i know he's just he's difficult at times it's hard to scrape under a family name when it's been through the ringer she gives you a look over i agree you guys are led down past a few buildings and then around the corner and while most of the heavy metalworks is done down below on the ground floor of the base of the mountain the more refined metalworks are done up here on the shelf as you approach you can already see the steelbringer's forge which has a number of shields and swords on display armor bits and you can see simple tools are crafted here as you step already looking into the main chamber door-- which is open because it's so hot in there they have to keep a breeze going through-- there are two forges going at any given point in time there are two anvils set up you see a few gnomes at work and indeed both fitz and ashton are both working as assistants they're not actually banging the hammer but they're both helping move things and quenching into the water and then helping gather materials and holding the metal and rotating it on the anvil as their bosses are hammering down they don't seem to notice your arrival (hammering) hold back boys there is one male gnome and one female dwarf that are both sitting there grabbing their nearby warhammers look around they look over and see the shadows in the corner what beast brings their way into our workplace name yourself they look at each other the dwarf female goes (hammering) back to work you see the two assistants look over and go-- and put their heads down and keep focused on their work the gnome says just take a break hi can we help you what did you do he slaps with a cloth and the assistant's like ah i didn't-- gah what did the boys do what'd they do you can see across the way ashton's like (gasps) and the dwarf goes well then best go talk to them gives them a little kick to the side and they both take their hammers down they take the metal off and put it back in the forge to heat and they both rest and cross their arms and watch the two boys look at each other and sheepishly step forward hi miss what can we do what are you asking about yeah what can we do rissa goes i don't know kind of like to do it in a place of business that way we can keep it above the board you know they both grab nearby stools and sit down deal deal what's the dc on that which one ashton or fitz fitz looks at you and goes-- and looks right to fjord the spell seemingly taking effect oh no you know i'm just-- his eyes go wide no not at all no what i wouldn't i earn my money ashton looks back no sir we were just looking-- we were just joshing we were just playing with rissa that was all (whimpering) i don't know maybe um-- make an intimidation check i'll let you both make one because you're doing it together they both look at each other and like (stuttering) there are probably some people who could've taken things i don't know there are shady folk in there all the time we don't have your money i swear i didn't do anything (sobbing) ashton's like come on get it together and kicks him and is like we're being completely honest we saw nothing we took nothing we were just getting our rocks off freaking people out and then we went back and got some drinks not personally no most of them end up in the gearhold (screaming) they both look at each other well originally he used to be an ice sailor up north by ice haven but he retired ten years ago i don't know ice sailor would be a person that forges the frozen depths up north the people you see on the deadliest catch it's that kind of a job sure okay okay he looks to ashton ashton's like okay (stuttering) no we'll ask around we'll do-- that's okay when the bosses--  you can look when you're done with the forge when the whistles blow have at it fitz is like i have to work it's my livelihood their spirits are pretty crushed right now and they're both like-- they both look at each other on a good day we give them about a gold for a day's work they nod the gnome steps forward takes the coin if you present it that's four gold so that's three of them for the two gold he goes okay you boys go get your work done here and we'll find some replacements and you hope they aren't better than you are the boys are like yes yes sir yes sir they get up and grab their stuff and then dart out into the street the two forge workers-- there's a pause like the two workers at the forge look at each other and look at you guys and go (laughs) i'm not going to lie those boys are going to be pissing their pants for a week after that that was enjoyable i hope so they need it they're a couple of pissants anyway we've got to go find some replacements but thank you for helping out with the transition at least they both look at each other and be like maybe ask down at the assembly yard there's a bunch of weird folks that wander down there lifelong industrial hammer workers not a lot of craft and skill mind gets a bit addled of course anyway we've got to go get back to work you guys wander outside oh no we don't specialize in firearms those are all regulated by the empire those are designed down in the assembly yard or that would be the iron lot is where that would be made no they seemed pretty standard i mean well-made looks like a lot of places like this are in the process of developing weaponry not just for home use but probably sending it out for the field she goes the assembly yard is down in the bottom half of the city so it's say about an hour hour and a half walk well that's that way about 25 minutes to get to the actual falls themselves and you see all the little towers over there those are where all the homes are assembled in that place with rissa guiding you guys back you manage to make your way outside of the main idle shelf area and in towards the cluster of the silver falls as you approach you can see the beautiful very wide waterfall that cascades down about a thousand feet across the mountainside until eventually it falls into this large lake where you can see columns of steam are rising up the closer you get you begin to realize that there is an element of this lake this waterfall and some sort of a steam engine-type mechanism built into the surrounding rock that they use to fuel probably the furnaces and elements of the technology within this city as you begin to hit the residential area you can see these large somewhat crooked-looking towers that themselves are maybe what would be the equivalent of 1500- to 1000-square-foot apartments but stacked four or five on top of each other with spiraling stairs on the outside to go to each level there aren't a lot of folks currently at home other than stay-at-home dads or moms that are watching children some folks that are putting out laundry on lines that are connecting between multiple towers and are dangling up two or three stories above the street but they're all made of dark irons and blacker metals so it gives the district this very weirdly-- what's the word i'm looking for a whimsical industrial revolution feel it's a unique mixture kind of or a hint of howl's moving castle in places there's also that spray of the waterfall hitting the lake behind which gives occasionally this light misting of water through the air you can see faint bits of rainbow that come through where the mist hits the sunlight as it makes its way across the waterfall spray mm-hmm no not at all oh yeah very much so okay as you make your way through you're not entirely sure where ol' blemmy is but you make your way towards where the middle rissa says of the district is-- sure make a perception check it's a 2nd-level spell do you want to cast it again or not the tokens okay you cast locate object you concentrate and focus extending your consciousness focusing on one of these wooden tokens the one that was won by one of the members of your party (pop) you get a blip behind you not quite in the district but right where the idleworks shelf transitions into the residential area on the idleworks shelf you get (boop) you guys dart after jester making your way down the road running (panting) you're closing the distance you weave through a couple buildings you're out of the residential part of the district again and you're back into the idle shelf but on the very back end of it there's warehouses and there's small buildings and eventually you come to the destination and it looks like it's a small building there's a sign out front that just says butcher and it's boarded up you see kiri pulls out her knife and goes (like jester) i can send a message (like fjord) shh nice there is a roof yeah it's one story it's not a huge building it's maybe three rooms make an acrobatics check she's already up okay all right you guys surround it (landing footfalls) there isn't a skylight per se but you do see there is a little smokestack that's about three feet wide or so two and a half feet wide make a perception check 14 glancing inside it's dark except for you can see the little beams of sunlight that are coming through the slats of wood on the roof glancing inside looking through you can see four figures in there that are currently not moving and they're all clustered together in the far corner they look gnome in size they're huddled together and they're not moving you look and they're starting to look around like they might have heard a noise no there's a door in the front and a door at the back the door in the front is like a sectional door a top and a bottom looks like it can be opened separately to sell out or wants to bring and sell meat over that side the back is just a general door it looks almost like a storage space or a back entry to it there are windows but they're boarded over you can try yeah you can certainly try (loud popping) it goes off on the inside is a flash of light you hear screams you guys all burst inside as you break through the doors wood splinters on the inside light breaks in and in the corner you can see what looks to be four gnomish children two of them teenage two of them younger all scared out of their minds the teenagers are trying to protect the two younger ones you can see a pile of gold around them on the ground they're just like (panting) there is a gnome girl the equivalent of like 17 or so with very brown curled hair it's this uncontrolled mass dirty on the cheek a younger boy with short red hair is the other protector of the two their clothes are pretty dirty then there's the younger girl that you saw wandering through the tavern who's on the ground clutching a stuffed bear you see a boy that's a little older than her about nine you would say equivalent with very long brown hair that's around the shoulders and they all just look scared she's not talking you look up as she comes out the bottom in a big old plume of soot just covered the older girl look we don't mean nothing we're just trying to get by okay we didn't realize how much you had on you and to be honest it was both exciting and scary just don't hurt anyone please take it the girl looks sad for a moment saying not for a little while we've scrambled coins here and there over time keep on by most everyone here only keeps a few coins in their pockets hence our surprise when this came about the younger boy goes like yeah we don't expect this kind of a payload the older girl goes i'm gail i'm 17 the older boy goes i'm austin the little boy with longer curly hair goes i'm jude the older girl points to the little girl and goes that's layla they all look at each other and the older boy sits forward and goes well they got arrested got arrested for idol worship false worship no changebringer avandra it's been in the family for a long time every six months the tithe collectors come through and they noticed they'd forgotten to put away their idol worship they locked them up they've been in the gearhold ever since you know about those those of you who've been in the empire part of living in the empire is about every six months or so there's a tax man a tithe collector that goes through usually with a couple crownsguard you recognize them by black cloak with gold trim usually dark clothing they go building to building business to business inspect ledgers ask about their business look at the means in which they're living and then make an estimation of what they owe they then collect the money and move on their way but you know this from your studies this is also used as a means of inspecting for any illegal activity and anything that goes against the crown often a lot of people get arrested for that we are gilda and wallace schuster we're schusters only about three months so far so good most people don't seem to pay much attention to the younger kids we just grab it and run we didn't know how much was here until we got back right no i understand gail says we understand sir we've learned our lesson thank you i've been trying best we can our parents worked as butchers so we had some food to keep us going for a while but when stuff got thin and begging wasn't working out we you know did what was necessary and i'll do what it takes to make sure my siblings stay healthy we've held up here this is where we grew up anytime now really it's been six months but we ain't much of a business at this time i hear stories they round them up and throw them to rexxentrum in orphanages and we don't want to go there (nervous chuckle) how would you intend on getting my parents out of the prison i mean legally we'd probably stay here and reopen the shop if it were by means where people would come looking for us we would definitely be heading somewhere other than here all right hey man attach them all by chains to your armor and you guys are the new dread emperor insight check yes do i believe him frustratingly so yes travis and i find it amusing let's see we had about three days traveling there since you left you have about two and a half weeks i'll say estimated at the moment i would say off the top of my head a little under a week at this point it's probably pushing one or two in the afternoon you did yeah do you give that to them the kids hungrily accept and devour evenly dividing amongst them they feed the younger kids first and then whatever is left over the older ones take they say thank you i really appreciate that all right we'll keep that in mind thank you thank you kindly is it a ring finger a finger ring he puts it over his thumb for his body and size it goes over his thumb it's still a little loose but it'll stay thank you i don't know how we'll repay you but-- yeah yasha's like no if we're going into a prison to kill something i want to be there kiri goes (like nott) that sounds adorable (like jester) okay (chirping) the little girl walks up and touches the feathers and you see the feathers of kiri's head (rustling) and her eyes close for a second as she's scratching the side of her head (cranking) (music box chiming) it starts playing and the little girl leans in and they all close in quickly for a moment you can see this little unit of kids meeting a new friend and a friend meeting new kids you're like okay they might be okay for a little bit they all nod to you kiri looks to fjord and (dagger unsheathing) (whispers) (like jester) okay (like fjord) stay quiet leaving the kids there you all quietly exit the building reaffirming the doors you had kicked in there you go you manage to get the doors back into a sizeable place and begin to discuss how you're going to tackle this next endeavor and that's where we'll finish this week's episode we'll pick up next week well done guys we'll see if-- see if you can earn your tinkertop boltblaster 1000 hey man good game guys awesome oh my goodness
