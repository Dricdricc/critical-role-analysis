it's too early for dice violence tap tap tap can you hear me through the mic that's the perfect time for the cricket sounds to go off you got this this is not your fault at worst we'll just have to share a mic no thank you for your patience we'll be with you in just a second okay audience sam's not here it's not the same that poor man didn't realize what he was doing when he did his first real loot crate pitch like well this is your job from now on yeah there's too much to live up to now so good morning everybody how you doing (cheering and applause) who's suffering today because of it (cheering) is that allura over there audience that is amazing i love it criticalcostumes for our halloween contest one of the two we'll just check them all i don't remember i'm still groggy so who are you well sometimes it helps end the conversation you don't need in the back of the uber my name is matthew mercer i'm a voice actor from los angeles we got it i've been playing dungeons & dragons most of my young adult and adult life and i'm damn proud of it there's other rpgs but d&d is kind of my mainstay and somehow this happened we all know what this means we don't know how this happened all righty so to give you a little heads up on that critical role is a twitch stream that we do pretty much every thursday night where me taliesin and a bunch of other nerdy-ass voice actors play dungeons & dragons it began as a private game we played for two years in pathfinder and then geek & sundry approached us because somehow word got around the industry that there was this voice actor d&d game and like you should do it on camera we were like eh yay success audience there isn't enough appreciation for the tech crew we were iffy on doing our game on-camera because it was something that was personal to us and whenever you put anything on the internet you're ready for the internet to tear it into 14 pieces light it on fire and laugh at you in your pile of tears when they told us they were doing a twitch channel and it allowed us to play unedited for all the rough bumps and mishaps that is an actual d&d game then at least that allowed us to continue what we were doing just adding cameras to the room i think we were happy to find that it really didn't change the experience too much and we're still having fun playing d&d once a week in front of a lot more people (angry voice) we'll give you ten bucks here you can kill percy every episode the whole marketing team crunched the numbers and you get at least a 25% increase in viewership every time taliesin is not on screen do it god if that conversation ever happened that's when we're gone at the very beginning they were like hey this show's going well you should do these things we went-- matt and they went what we went we'll leave they went do your thing it's been nice to be able to hold our ground everyone involved with the show's production really cool people and we have a good time so that's the gist of critical role you can check it out it's a bunch of us just improvising making weird voices and rolling dice but yes this is primarily a conversation q&a about the show and anything surrounding games that you have any burning questions you got in the back of your skull it is actually before that was 35 and every edition previously i only have so much free time we started streaming a once a week campaign we used to play once every six to eight weeks maybe mind you we'd play for a marathon session it would be a six to nine hour game when we did play we'd just block out an entire saturday (sadly) yeah i know they have a new edition out too no i still have them at my place (laughter) me neither that's fine me and marisha did try that the new mansions of madness edition is really cool a fan sent us a copy and pre-painted all the minis which is so awesome i think i opened it on the last periscope we did but it was really cool because i've been wanting to have mansions of madness with all the minis painted i got half of them done with the older edition and just didn't have time and so it was really cool that somebody did that no it was just me and marisha you can play with two people it takes a little bit of a learning curve but once you get there it actually runs pretty well narratively actually it's pretty cool because-- anyway hi guys you're here too i know let's have some questions how about that you pick first we had discussed your next possible character i already have a way to work it into the lore and the current story pike got close let's go on the-- i'm biased hi allura sorry guys you come dressed up as an npc i'm going to pick your question first just setting that up for future panels audience the question was how many hours does it take to prep for a session as a dm it varies depending on what's coming up if the next episode the players are on a very clear track and i know what the next couple of events they're probably going to encounter might be then i'd say it takes about an hour of prep per hour of gameplay so if it's going to be a three to four hour session three to four hours of preparation as i recently discovered with the episode where they were bringing you back i call that a nexus episode where there are multiple plot threads out there and they can go to any of them and they're getting to a point in the story where they have to make that choice of where to go then my life becomes horrible because i have to prepare for many different opportunities here so that was about a four-hour episode i think i prepped about nine hours for that one that was also because i didn't know if they were going to go into the abyss to try and find yenk the goristro in which case i had to prepare a bunch of encounters in the abyss and made two additional maps for various abyss-based encounters i didn't know if they were going to go for the dawnmartyr plate so i had stuff for the city of brass prepared including some encounters that would have worked with the fire plane and the city of brass i also had a couple other npc encounters i prepped a lot of things so that i wouldn't be completely lost if they went off the rails which they always do anyway but you try your best as a dm to prepare i made a whole whitestone battle map just in case they decided to say sorry raishan and then attack which would have gone really poorly for everybody involved it can vary depending on what point in the story they are but on average it's about an equal amount of hours per prep to gameplay usually good question you pick now let's see trying to make this quick i have a bunch of gm tips videos you can go look up which go into more detailed stuff and i have more of those starting soon we did a whole new run of them that go into more of the nuts and bolts a little look under the hood there look for those soon my recommendation is start small it's very easy to get lost in like well i have to create a world and create all these civilizations and political struggles and (screaming) start in a very small location a key location and flesh that out well so the players can play within that small space and you have a really good idea of what can be done in that area then as they're playing in that space you can then expand a little and expand a little so definitely start small and then grow out that doesn't work for everybody of course people love the whole world building aspect and that's totally fine but for people that are starting it can be a little daunting other than that keep in mind some of the best experiences are when you're trying to facilitate the players to have incredible moments the very old school gygaxian mindset of dm versus players i will smash you all and you will have fun can work as long as you all agree ahead of time that that's the kind of game you want to play if you want to run tomb of horrors and your friends are like yeah let's do tomb of horrors then yeah go ahead and do it that's awesome just make sure that everybody's on the same page on what kind of game you want to run that way you don't end up getting halfway through and someone is like oh i thought we were going to do like political intrigue i made a character based around that now we're fighting kobolds and i can't do anything then you end up leaving out players so have everyone talk beforehand and make sure you're all on the same page with what kind of game you want to run i think those are two big steps right there audience no worries i know i'm going to go in the way back you sir with the yellow shirt on the left or pink shirt i can't tell audience orange shirt oh it's in between i got to the bookend colors and eventually came together audience in regards to the campaign setting which has been an amazing experience of having no free time i'm excited for it i've never written something like this before and i hope you guys will like it first off i'm trying to see if i can get permission to put those in the book because one of the interesting elements of putting things on the dm's guild is technically in the rules you're not allowed to then publish them in other facets it's one of those now it's on dm's guild it stays on dm's guild circumstance so i'm trying to see if i can find a way to put the blood hunter and the gunslinger in there as far as turning it into a full class people can do their own mods i created it as an archetype because i didn't feel there was necessarily enough there for the build that i did to make it a full class i could if i had time and i wanted to stretch it out but it seems to be working fine the way we have it so i'm probably not going to change it dramatically from what's been tested and worked in the campaign but there are other people out there that have made their own custom firearm gunslinger based classes out there that are actually pretty awesome i saw a gun mage class that was pretty cool on the dm's guild gun cleric heal heal you're basically ana so we'll see i don't think it's going to become a full class more than just an archetype just because that's what we have tested primarily and creating anything new and publishing it without having any real extensive test time sounds like a really bad idea to me it's a powerful class the grit recycling works really well for crits and deaths it seems to balance pretty well from being a little bit stronger in some cases and then the drawbacks can be pretty nasty at times if you play a gunslinger pull a percy and make sure you have as many john woo weapons on you as possible indeed good question to be fair he also has hair too we all have hair we'll do the guy with the hair and then we'll do the guy with the hair audience yeah the cool thing about d&d is you can try anything whatever you think fits your campaign go for it a tranq dart aspect with healing potions could get expensive very quickly plus nothing sucks more than pumping a 150 200 gold potion into a tranq dart and then missing also rolling a critical one and hitting the creature instead is like whoa 1d4 healing per dart you'd be surprised it's like a gunslinger alchemist combo that would be interesting yeah try it out why not no reason not to that's why i like d&d you can just do anything and it'll probably not work but you'll have fun trying i feel like we should get the other guy with the hair yeah exactly audience because they realize oh this is kind of what we do for a living anyway then comparably we had rothfuss who had plenty of d&d experience but even he came on and before we started playing he was like i'm really intimidated he was nervous in the kitchen i'm like you wrote the name of the wind are you serious once again once he got comfortable with it he made an amazing character that had an amazing story impact to keyleth's personality it was so good on the other end of that i will say part of the reason i even became a voice actor was because of d&d i played these games long before i became a professional actor and as a dm especially having to create all of these personalities and inhabit them and find variations to voices to try and mix it up and make the characters interesting became a toolbox of personalities that i was able to fine-tune and utilize as a voice actor later in life i can say with complete honesty probably a third of the characters i've ever performed as an actor had some sort of root or base as an npc in my high school d&d games so yes both ways that's fantastic audience nuke it from orbit it's the only way to be sure audience there's always the oh guys my shift changed i can't make the game time sorry have fun you can do the white lie route because then nobody gets hurt people come in and out of games all the time because of work if you're not enjoying the game you can always talk to the dm beforehand and let them know in some cases without communication they might not be aware that they're running sessions that aren't to your liking or tastes if they're a good dm they'll be open to constructive criticism and be like oh okay i didn't know that that was an aspect that you were missing but you wanted i'll see if i can incorporate that more into the game for you if they're really defensive and like well if you don't like my game then step off then step off they just gave you complete permission to cut away free and dry like all right see you sucker which is why once again communication before you start playing is so key because that way everyone has an idea of what they're looking for and if it's the game for them and the dm knows what kind of players to tailor the story to i would recommend first having a conversation and express that because there is a possibility that it could become what you're looking for i would say give the dm the chance to go ahead and do that if they're not willing to then just respectfully bow out and look for a game that more suits your interests because it is your free time that you're allocating to this don't feel like you should stay out of obligation that's a good way of putting it good luck i'm going to go ahead and pick you sir over on the far side with the zelda shirt audience i love d&d because it's what i grew up with and the 5th edition system is really comfortable to me it takes a lot of my favorite aspects of older editions and streamlines them where it allows you to build narrative within the rules a lot easier which as a person who loves narrative more than anything that to me is a great thing but there are other systems that do it really well too the fate system is really fun i've played a few games in the fate system as far as sci-fi stuff goes i really enjoy traveler and diaspora those are both really good traveler is one of the few rpg systems where you can die in character creation that and hol definitely i love the deadlands setting like the weird west it's very cool very strange and i love good western settings anyway so that one's a great one the original system though complicated i think is the better of the two but if you want more of a simple gameplay style you can go with the newer editions which is what we did for our one-shot if you want the other end of dumb anime rpgs you want to go full saiyan or ninja scroll style insanity exalted is always a good time exalted is more like i put all my strength into one final attack destroy everything it's fun gurps is fun in the same way that paper is fun depending on what you do with paper it can be a lot of fun or really boring speaking of which rifts also is a ridiculous experience in the same vein i'm not saying it's a good system actually the marvel rpg that came out five or six years ago was actually pretty decent different characters were better at being a solo fighter versus a group fighter versus a team fighter and you had different dies depending on what you were a specialist with some characters like wolverine had better damage rolls if they were away from a team it was pretty fun there are a couple dudes-- then the other guy with the glasses audience that's pretty epic someone please draw that oh man let's see this is one of the more ridiculous experiences talking about rifts i think i mentioned this in a couple panels before my friend todd huntington in high school was obsessed with rifts it was his favorite system he owned every book rifts uk rifts asia rifts atlantis wormwood everything palladium he had his big thing was because all the books technically were in the same ruleset any palladium book was on the table to be used some way in the game we had fun with it but part of the fun of rifts was trying to show him how broken rifts was he was like it's the best system ever and we were like it's really not and here's why he's like no it's great as we got into the later power levels of the game they also had the macross license which is what happened in the macross book they had the rules for the sdf-1 which is the giant ship now everything in rifts has a damage value as a weapon even if it's 1d4 times one million megadamage which some of the higher-level ship cannons do there is a damage value except for the sdf-1's main cannon which takes ten minutes to warm up before it fires but we're talking death star style cannon damage destroys everything in its path everything so our team decided let's go hijack the sdf-1 so we went and wiped out the entire crew kept the few that were necessary as slaves to run the actual ship then we asked todd to hand us one of the other palladium books which was the pantheon book which had stats and rules for all these different pantheons all the ancient sumerian gods like apsu tiamat enki marduk yeah they have all the rules for the norse pantheon for the hindu pantheon and they all had hundreds of millions of hit points but that didn't matter because our gun destroyed everything in its path so we went god hunting after we took out thor and odin with one shot our gm todd went this is so stupid i'm done end of the game but we won i just envision all the really sweet well-dressed macross crew walking across the board in a very next gen feel like captain we need to-- all of a sudden this beam in like an apok from wormwood and someone in a glitter boy outfit starts blasting people laughing the whole time thank you taliesin all right other glasses audience it's good to work the system in your favor but at the same time if it's at the cost of the narrative and everyone else's enjoyment then perhaps you need to reassess what kind of game you're playing with as far as being that guy who constantly messes with the narrative some people you can curb them to make it work sam riegel's a good example of that he skirts the line at times but he never does it to detract from anybody else's experience and that's the key when there is somebody like that you have to talk to them about it after a game like hey man come here for a second i just want to let you know i know you're having a good time with this but what you're doing is kind of ruining the experience for a few other people is there any way you can scale it back or just be mindful of everyone else who's playing as well you might be surprised people might be open to it and be like oh i'm sorry i didn't realize that okay cool thank you for telling me i'll keep that in mind if they're like no screw you i'm doing this anyway woo spring break yeah so try and talk to them if that doesn't work out get with the other players and find out how you can ambush his character don't do that (laughing) are you serious talk to them if that doesn't work kill their character let's go in the back you sir in the way back with the goatee or it might've been a shadow with the glasses you it was a shadow i'm sorry but you should grow a goatee it would look good everyone's always go-to is chaotic neutral because you can do anything and i'm like eh but also-- honestly i enjoy the idea of playing lawful good to show people that it doesn't have to be that goody two shoes stick in the mud ruin everyone else's experience alignment yeah comparably lawful evil can be fun to play because even though you tend to skew towards a darker morality you understand the necessity of structure and order and the necessary circumstances in which you must make alliances you wouldn't normally have which is one of the few alignments that can work in a good to neutral based group with an evil character one if they can keep that kind of under wraps or conversely convince the party that it is a mutually beneficial arrangement they may not trust you but they may still go along with you that gives you the opportunity to either try and convert other members of the party or conversely over time maybe see the light there's a lot of different ways you could play that alignment it's a difficult one but it can be a lot of fun there's a reason why taliesin is one of my favorite players i've kept him around for a number of reasons well next campaign you pick that's the challenge especially for larger groups i would not recommend for anybody a group larger than four or five players this just happened to be a large party which i took upon as a challenge for myself audience ten why would you do that why you're so crazy audience there you go well now you've been multi-warned it's a challenge and you want to be mindful of that because you don't want any players to feel left out what you do is as you're creating story-- not necessarily every session can have a golden moment for every character but you want to strive for that sort of experience where you can think of different scenarios where each person has a chance to shine that's where players writing backstories come in really handy for you is you can find ways to intertwine their history with the current story thread or future story threads where they not only feel more invested in the current adventure but you give them an opportunity to really step up and be involved in the resolution of that storyline but when you're constructing encounters and dangers and traps and various challenges keep in mind what the strengths of each party member are and what they're good at and try and tailor experiences where they themselves naturally feel inclined to step up and be like hold on i got this as opposed to being like there's this thing that you should be doing bard they won't always get it and that's fine they'll stumble because that's half the fun of the game is watching your players fall over and going heh you poor kids but it is a challenge you can only create so much story as a dm when the other half of it is the players picking it up and running with it it is that collaboration that makes it so magical but also is a little daunting and complicated to prepare for so be mindful to try and create at least one experience per player per session where they have the opportunity to rise up and shine a bit yeah whether they take it or not if they don't then someone else will take it up (phone rings) just be mindful of that as you prepare yeah it helps you set up your own mystery essentially you're including the building blocks for a really really cool series of surprises down the road for you by writing it that way mind you add some structure don't hand me a piece of paper that says i don't know the rest of it i went nuts with all right let's see the glasses and the green shirt back there audience i'll jump in real fast one thing metagaming isn't a bad word i want to specify this sometimes people on the internet have responded to one of our players unintentionally metagaming they'll be like oh damn it i hate when they metagame it's the worst it happens we're people and it is a game that we're playing while there's an in-character element there is an aspect of our brain that is trying to put the pieces together you know from a gamer standpoint so it's going to happen intentionally or not don't beat yourself up over it by any means it's one of those things that comes with comfort and experience the more you're with a character the easier it is to stay in that mindset the newer you are to a campaign you're still feeling out their skin you're still getting what separates you from that character and being able to jump back and forth what you're experiencing is not an uncommon thing every player goes through that to a certain extent us as performers our lifestyle is jumping into and out of characters and even we still have it happen every now and then you can't help it it's just taking some time to really understand the mindset of your character think as opposed to what makes you similar what makes them so different from you and embrace that difference and really adhere to that the best you can when the survival instinct kicks in take a step back take a breath and remember what that character's thought process is what makes them different from you then jump back in and hold onto that difference that's what's going to help you kind of stay in character and keep from metagaming in that moment it's not perfect it's hard to be perfect because we're all broken human beings by nature that's just our existence but that does help that's really good the last thing i'll say on that topic is it's honestly as fun sometimes to let yourself fail than it is to succeed in these rpgs so when that instinct kicks in you're like i know that's dangerous i shouldn't go towards it even though my character wouldn't know just think but man my character walking right into this is going to make such a great surprise moment for the rest of the characters and the story i might just have to let it happen exactly be okay with embracing failure and bad scenarios even though your brain tells you otherwise if the character wouldn't know let them walk into that trap yeah we've got time for a few more yes he was (laughter) audience oh yeah i played a midlands game where i made a guy who's like a 75-year-old crotchety sharpshooter but i took every single penalty i possibly could so he was nearsighted he was just an ornery fella he was just the worst person nobody liked him nobody hung around him he just got drunk and passed out in every alleyway everyone was like why is he still alive and why is he still here nobody liked him but every now and then he could pull out his six-shooter and just destroy-- (taliesin's phone rings) it was a character that completely broke down when we got to the game and it was glorious because every party member had their strength he was a sharpshooter but he had terrible vision and he couldn't shoot anything so he literally missed every single attack but man wasn't he excited to take the credit for every victory they had he was useless mechanically but from a story standpoint he was an amazing character to have for the rest of the party because he annoyed everybody but everyone found that that ridiculous confidence and the lack of capability was endearing in a weird way so he became this mascot of the party for a while well you have to make it in a way where they're comedic and how ridiculous and over the top they are in their confidence and still able to buy them a round of drinks because he's the papa bear who helped save them all good question let's see hi vex audience if you wink you'll probably get advantage it was a natural 20 on the table so it was a 14 plus let's see-- it was a +5 modifier for being proficient in that so that's 19 plus the charisma bonus so that's easily 23 because she multi-classed into rogue and took the expertise feat it's double proficiency bonus so-- (applause) (cheering) hey man audience to be fair i was and am that fat guy in the basement arguing about the rules still that's always been a part of it but because when it first became a cultural phenomenon whenever anything is misunderstood at large by the public people then label it pigeonhole it and shove it aside it's never really been just that there's been a large faction initially of the gygaxian era of chainmail players and there was definitely a-- it's always been more diverse than people expected it to be i think what the internet's helping with it's giving a platform for everyone to show how diverse the community has always been and is continuing to be i think what's great about livestreaming games and a lot of people being able to be more open about this hobby is it's giving people one the confidence to be like oh yeah no i totally play these games and they're a lot of fun and here's my gaming group conversely allowing a whole new generation of people to embrace it because they thought for a long time it was something that you don't talk about and now it can be cool to discuss about it in the older crowd and a new generation of people that are being exposed to it for the first time and being like oh this is actually really cool and different than any other form of entertainment i've done and starting up their own gaming groups in school then merging the fact that the person i've seen geek out hardest over a natural 20 roll is vin diesel should help push the diversity factor of how many people have been affected by this type of gaming experience yeah he did all the mocap for godzilla in the recent godzilla movie he was the dungeon master he had all the books and was like all right we're making characters sit down it's always been diverse and it's continuing to grow more and more so as more people have the opportunity to be exposed to it now it's a cool thing to talk about again which is great i'm excited to see where it goes from here nothing makes me more excited than having people send me pictures of their game group some of them are a whole spread of ethnicities and varying sexes-- yeah it's a family thing i've seen so many people that like their kids and their parents play together now and it's this great bonding experience with the family core there isn't a lot of opportunity for people to enjoy something as a family quite like this (maniacal laugh) we've got two more-- we're supposed to rush over to our signing it's 102 one more quick question taliesin you've got it that's a way to do it yeah audience putting a timer and giving people a very limited period of time to succeed or decide is always fun doing the initiative order ahead of time is great whatever you can do to reduce the amount of rolls everyone has to make or doing group rolls like if they have to do a group stealth check designate somebody in the group that is the designated roller for that circumstance who does like three rolls average them out you can find ways to keep those a little more streamlined and creatively come up with ways to help you do that also you can have two dms i ran a game for a couple years with me and my friend zach hanks both co-dmed which allowed us both to get together to write the stories having someone to bounce story ideas off which means you construct cooler ideas which helps because then you have half as many npcs you designate an npc to one or the other and that person always deals with that npc also you have one person handling the music while you're setting a scene or vice versa or while you're tracking initiative and whose turn order it is he's handling the monster combat rounds having a co-dm can be a really good way to alleviate some of that pressure and plus you have a partner in crime now five players six and then sean left guys we are over time for our panel thank you so much for hanging please don't be pained if we're a little pressed we have a lot of people we want to get through we want to make sure everyone gets signed and we have-- we're trying we'll shake hands we love you guys see you in a minute [light piano music] audience
