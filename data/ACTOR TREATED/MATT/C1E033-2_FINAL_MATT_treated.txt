instead of using the table though you use grog's knee you just run jump onto his knee with one foot leap off blade in the air go for the strike attack bonus for your weapon yeah so as you rush in the air you hesitate for a moment remembering the pike thing and you see this burning arcane rage in the face of this entity at that moment that hesitation was all it needed it takes the shield and almost knocks the weapon out of your hand you catch yourself land on your feet-- yeah your fingers sting a little bit (laughs) worth a shot all right in retribution it's going to strike at you twice that's a 15 21 that is seven points of slashing damage all right keyleth you're up roll for it heavy armor on these guys all right vex you're up i'll say yeah you can see him all right you can move over there and get a better view a little bit just around this corner off the table hunter's mark him okay go for it 19 the arrow hits the armor and shatters across the side 24 does hit because of the shield and the armor 18 points of damage with that the second arrow strikes into the center of its chest armor it hits some sort of core where its arcane form is held and the reddish energy blinks out and the armor just (impact noise) crumples to the ground go ahead and make a medicine check yeah all right make a perception check for trinket yeah it's his wisdom bonus 26 okay 25 okay trinket is giving chase best it can okay so trinket is keeping track but is having a hard time fully keeping up at this point unless you're giving full attention towards him at this point in time but is keeping a track he is rushing as fast as he can down the stairs and is currently out of your sphere of personal influence at the moment okay checking cassandra there is no sign of a wound now she seems to be not in any danger so she's on the ground dazed it is a lot of gore okay you guys are currently out of combat (laughs) and on that note we're going to go ahead and take a quick little break (laughs) all right quick break all right awesome quick break guys see you guys back here in a few minutes hell yeah all right so with the chaos that has ensued through the battle in anders's study in the castle of whitestone the party looks about cassandra de rolo recovered and pulled from seemingly the brink of death vax pulled seemingly from the brink of death and percy managing to squeak in a second killshot on a member of his list as the rest period kicks in vax stepped across the room holding his wound to his side admitting his affection for keyleth and reaching out and kissing her no so as he breaks from the momentary unexpected embrace you catch yourself off guard burn all the spell slots go ahead and roll all right what are you doing okay collect the arrows vex has stepped out of the room to pursue after trinket trinket is currently pursuing ripley grog you watched that happen okay have you guys bolted out okay as you're saying this you turn around you can see she's sat up and she sees this conversation and goes percy percy and she gets up off the ground and runs up and just grabs you and embraces you tightly you can feel all the muscles tense in her body as she just holds you with a slight shake to her body i thought you were dead she pulls away for a second and just looks at you and there's a coldness to her face she's happy but even for her young age you can see there's lines at the corners of her eyes she's probably been through a lot she smiles and looks up at you again and you can see there's the white shocks in her hair and she looks up and touches your hair and goes i see we've both survived quite a bit she laughs to herself and you see another tear curl at her eye and then her face goes cold for a second and she not breaking this gaze steps back you shouldn't be here they were using me to get to you i'm so sorry she reaches up and holds her neck i'm good i'm good and she steels herself for a second and even more so you see there's an intensity to her to okay go for it no because you were concentrating yeah and that's wisdom not a saving throw 11 okay best you can tell she seems very honest she seems forthright you're used to the memory of your sister being this bright-eyed cheerful youngest of the bunch and definitely a woman who sees the world with fresh eyes these eyes are different they're colder they're hardened in ways you're impressed in ways you're also immediately sad to see that that memory of your sister probably is no longer there you say this we've tried twice that's what the others thought you left me you know good well if we're going to do this let's get ready yes i am no no i'm not i'm going to my room to get my things to get my mother's armor you've been fighting them for what a few days i've been fighting them for nearly three years you have no power over me brother and if our goals are aligned to free this city let's do it together but i don't have to listen to you she walks out of the room you guys charging off trinket's keeping trail she's run down the stairway he is beginning to slowly gain on her she reaches the front doors does remember the caltrops jumps over them grabs the door opens it and rushes out into the daylight go ahead and roll a perception check for trinket yeah trinket just jumps over the door's only slightly open so trinket has to stop and wedge his way through it's the same speed as if he dashed it would be the same speed however it takes a moment to get through you guys now get down the stairs as trinket opens the door and wedges through there's a scent out there but she's nowhere in visible range she's either darted off the path or possibly off the actual sides and you can see now the struggle that's happened you can now hear in the distance the sound of yells and fighting and there doesn't appear to be any one side or the other pushing okay as you get to the landing you whistle out and trinket is just now pushing through the door and gets out for a bit looking back and forth looks over the shoulder and runs back to you it appears that ripley has scattered into whitestone somewhere okay are you waiting in the study okay she goes off to her room you're there for a few minutes okay make an investigation check he's crumpled up against the desk in the corner there's all these papers that got pushed off the side there were a bunch of random scrawlings 24 okay you search his body you find 120 gold pieces on him not a whole lot he doesn't keep his important shit on him for the most part you do find however the boots that he's wearing are very finely crafted and unlike the rest of his wear have a hand-stitching in it that is exemplary in construction and doesn't match with the rest of his ensemble so it seems like something you'd wear more for function than for actual style pardon you take them okay okay if you're taking a short rest you can take the short rest to inspect the boots get the feel for them they are indeed enchanted they are a pair of boots of levitation once per day you can trigger the levitation for up to ten minutes as per the spell you can't actually move as part of it you just levitate in the air and you have to push off to get space zero-g they fit anyone who wishes to put them on magical items alter themselves anything else you want to do while you're waiting yeah go ahead and make an investigation check okay good as you're looking through and finding papers papers and ledgers and tough discussions of old classes untouched on the side you go through one of the bottom drawers and there's a lock to it make a perception check it does appear to be trapped thieves' tools as well so same check you did as part of that you notice that this mechanism is when it opens if there isn't a switch underneath it held that's hidden it will cause a poison dart to launch out in the direction of whoever's in front of it you hold the button you find it you open it up without an issue and you find the spring mechanism snap it and remove the little poison-tipped bolt and chuck it to the side okay you have a poison-tipped bolt for a tiny little hand-crossbow is essentially what it is yeah natural 20 oh okay easy enough to unlock at this point you get it open you pull it open there's a collection of letters you glance through and inspect them and you take the next ten minutes or so to get the gist of these letters while cassandra's away many of them talk about a slew of things that are disconcerting to you as the information hits you and you relay this information to the group notes on the removal of key magical defenses during the political meeting at emon the discussion as in making sure that certain individuals and safeguards that are usually made during political meetings like that were not present during that endeavor notes on best construction methods using the mined whitestone and repairs for the manse in the ziggurat marisha and a manse is a place or a home it has many different meanings they're warning anders and there are multiple letters at different periods of time over the past few years that are warning anders of an arrival of seeker asum's spies there are letters talking about plotting diverting political attention away from whitestone to leave it a political enigma during this period of time there are letters talking about planting information within wildmount that would lead their investigation team to believe the briarwoods had been found dead and occasionally there are mentions in a lot of these letters that speak of the undying king shall return we are his blood the undying king shall return we are his blood the letters aren't signed they are all of the same handwriting in the cluster there is one completely unrelated letter that talks about business ledgers and construction of the bridge it appears to be a simple discussion on the future plans to construct the bridge it is in the same handwriting it is signed a lord riskel daxio riskel daxio laura and yep he's on the council of tal'dorei he's technically also the one that helped designate the construction of your keep and plotted the construction stuff-- yes you did 30 days glancing within the kitchen there doesn't appear to be much that catches your attention like you do there was already a fire in the fireplace but you just stoke it a little further and pretty soon the delicious scent of burning human flesh fills the room at the time at least there's nothing on fire there's no screams there's no movement it just seems like the cold kitchen is untouched as you have this conversation a voice from the doorway rings out i can take you you look over and it's cassandra she's currently now dressed in armor you've seen as ornamental before it was armor that your mother trained in when she was young but was unused for a long time it seems to be serviceable it's been updated and such she slides a shortsword into a sheath at her side and her hair is pulled back and tied off and she looks at the rest of the room so are we ready she steps up and lifts her chin up towards you no it seems fine there's no signs of any puncture wounds rolling okay she seems as determined as the rest of you she turns around and she begins walking back down the hallway that i'm aware of no but i'm certain that there may be they know you're coming it seems so be wary be careful i'll take you to the undercroft you did he could use it he just wouldn't be able to add his proficiency bonus to the attack rolls okay you take it you inspect it as you guys are walking along it seems pretty functional it's well-constructed it's sleek your pepperbox has a bit of flair to its design this is your background hers is just streamlined simple much like the decor of her room when you saw it she doesn't mess with anything fancy or unnecessary the ammunition she does have are made specific to size to her pistol they will not function for the pepperbox unfortunately they will only work for the pistol it does act as a pistol for rules-wise which is on your sheet here so yes you would have that all right go ahead and roll dexterity roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier i don't know add zero what did you roll okay you manage to get it in there thankfully it's not loaded because you feel the trigger go off but there wasn't a bullet loaded so it's like (click) okay sleight-of-hand check athletics check yeah add your athletics to your roll as you go to be no what are you-- it's already gone you don't even know where it went you didn't see him take it you just all of a sudden see it in his hand as he walks past you yes he wanted me to shout for help he wanted me to draw you in yeah 24 she's telling the truth well after the arrows felled me-- i guess i should start at the beginning and she's walking along with you guys as she's leading you down the stairs and down to the bottom floor she doesn't look to you she's still looking ahead very intent after the arrows felled me i recovered father reynal found me brought me from the brink at the temple of pelor outside of town things hadn't fallen quite that far back then we had more people in the city at the time the briarwood rule was fresh and folks were eager to speak out against what they had wrought on this city the fall of the de rolos we still thought they had fallen to plague but through some unfortunate political business they had come to power but we began to question it i knew better i told the truth once i'd recovered we began to build our first rebellion two years we built up the resistance before we made our first move they seemed to know exactly what we were plotting cut us off at every angle couldn't see who it was who was giving up our information but i knew it was close but before i had the opportunity i was helming a group that was traveling to utilize the escape route that i took you through when they first attacked it was just after dusk and lord briarwood was there waiting for us in the forest he slaughtered most of the men but he recognized my face from the dinner we had the night they took the castle they did not harm me strangely they treated me like a guest against my will in my own house i seemed to ascertain that by keeping me there having a member of the house within their grasp they could use that as leverage i don't know sylas he had his charms and there were many that worked beneath them against their own will it did not work on me my hatred was too strong so instead they tried to provide me with wealth power here in whitestone i just took to reading and ignoring it all i don't know why they kept me around but i wasn't going to question it if it gave me a chance to possibly undermine them she grabs the side of her sword as you guys have now reached now down the long hallway towards the back of the castle you know the direction she's taking you it leads to the cellar to the undercroft and the de rolo mausoleum three years of reading in that library father's library strategy tactics old lines of information as well as the myths and history of whitestone i found allies within the castle i contacted yennen and through him archibald who helped me build the first rebellion archibald still lives percy he's been completely necessary for what we've built here she looks down at her armor as you guys reach the edge of the cellar and she pulls the door open quietly there's wooden stairs that lead down into the cellar she taps her armor this was mother's it's good to know i'm not the only tomboy in the bloodline brushes the hair out of her face and for the first time really looks at you with a smile since she first saw you i completely understand the only thing you really have seen work is the greater restoration spell you cast on seeker asum when you guys were with the council of tal'dorei that did seem to remove any sort of charm effects if that's what you're asking what can i do to make you trust me she smiles a little whatever you need does anyone have any creative means with which they would want to check in theory if that's what it takes she takes it from your hand and inspects it for a second shoddy craftsmanship places it on her head and it's a little big at first then it conforms to her head she sits down a couple of steps deeper into the cellar curls around a corner ushers you all over into the shadows from this location no all the windows that would be here would face out into the north side of whitestone which is forested you guys are on the north side of the castle now the city is south from you so you take a moment and sit while you guys are waiting she takes a moment she's adjusting it and feeling it and inspecting her hands (sighs) i don't feel any different while we wait-- she gives a wry grin whatever you choose your resistance doesn't make you attuned to it unfortunately it's just a natural ability that's inherent her being human there's not a way to really correlate with that i mean you've read over her a few times doing insight checks she puts her hand out her leather glove's pulled over it now you've never seen her militant before and it's a really interesting visual to you she drinks the potion whole thing down (coughs) she gives a wry grin and wipes her mouth i thought i recognized that terrible earthy taste she tosses the crystal decanter to you huh you always were the clever one do you need this thing she hands it back to you there's a fascination she has with her armor i've not been able to wear this before it feels good to have something close to mother simon repaired it for me when he was working here i haven't seen him in a while i'm worried she leads you down through the cellar-- you can ask her anything you'd like she goes i have no confirmation of it but they spend most of their time down here they're preparing for something i'm not allowed down here by their orders but i've snuck down a few times out of curiosity i've only gotten so far before i had to return but i've made it through the undercroft through most of the tunnels and i've gotten to the distillery and that's about as far as i've gotten but i've followed them down here and they usually come with a group of guards four or five strong it's definitely a possibility so move quietly be careful what is lady briarwood she's a wicked beast of a creature is what she is i'd use less savory words but my brother's here as she leads you guys down the stairs towards the undercroft she goes she's not like her husband that i know as far as i can tell she's human but she has a very powerful control over life and death she's a practitioner of the arcane definitely but her focus seems to be necromancy on a wide scale and while delilah and sylas are man and wife they speak of another it's as if a third party completes their union they don't say any names they refer to him as 'him' or 'the whispered one' no reference beyond that vedmeyer yes i've only seen him in the castle maybe three times since we've been here cassandra looks over her shoulder at this it's a shame you're not as tall as your tales small one undercroft she was referring to yes with a flicker of scanlan's arcane mastery all of you form into a small battalion of percys and cassandras he would have to be yeah because he still stays similar to his actual size so if percy was a little thicker and a little taller-- yep cassandra looks around very confused for a second curious yes so i'm beginning to see well then she pulls her shortsword out shall we as are we all everyone roll stealth checks okay plus ten 30 plus whatever your bonus is i thought you rolled a natural 20 oh you 39 your sister just out-stealthed you you all (whoosh) vanish solid point she's very uncomfortable right now by the way continuing down a long set of whitestone-constructed stairs descend for about 45 feet before they level off into the de rolo mausoleum a long hallway continues forward that contains two ten-by-ten stone structures that contain the entombed bodies of previous generations of de rolos with six passages-- three on each side-- that split off of this main hallway that contain their own stone-encapsulated corpses this is a place of silent prayer and showing appreciation for the previous families not all of them are full and there were extensions planned as the family grew but the first thing you notice is all of the tomb doors are open is anyone holding a torch light source going through this have you been carrying it with you throughout this okay okay so you have enough light sources to keep a general idea of what's going on and i know a lot of you guys have darkvision too so you have a pretty decent range what's the marching order here guys just so i know continuing down this path towards the front is trinket staying with you or staying in back grog's second keyleth is you said in the middle all right the rest of you guys okay scanlan you staying towards the back all right percy and vax all right and this is cassandra okay so it's like a flying v formation you guys are pushing in here all right so you progress through the undercroft as quietly as possible you notice as you get past the first section you look to your right and left and the inside of these small like cubby offshoots that contain these separate ten by ten stone tombs the walls have shelves burrowed into it in which there are urns and small gems and offerings-- things that were buried alongside the family members as part of a remembrance liam and yeah no don't go skyrim on me once again you see the doors are open and from what you can tell the stone lids on the tombs are pulled off and to the side across the way as you move towards the center of the room to the second set of openings you can see the far wall which the room ends in the far side but there is about a 15 20-foot wide and about a ten to 15-foot tall hole burrowed into the far wall and the closer you get you see large piles of dirt that fill one side of the room were put off to the side as if pieces of this dig were discarded and there is a trail of dirt across the ground that appears to have not been very well cleaned to show that dirt was being moved in and out of this area you also see as you push two-thirds into the room broken pieces of whitestone that had been carved into what looks like parts of walls or pillars support things that failed in their construction and just broke and were tossed and discarded to the side make a perception check a one one of you critters out there has to get taliesin a really really pretty new d20 that he has to use going forward not that one (laughter) okay okay those of you with about 25 or above you glance and you find two of these slivers of this material you don't recognize and part of this broken stone it's like a dark green glass about a half an inch to an inch thick in slivers you only find a small scattering few and it has a grainy texture to it and you take a look at it and it's transparent you can see shapes through it but it's opaque enough to the point where it distorts a little bit of the visual and color behind it which broken glass you collected before oh the sea of bone and glass okay yeah it is not similar to that no however those who are trained in arcana you can go ahead and make an arcana roll trained in arcana you would have filled in if you have a proficiency you have really no idea what this glass is okay sure it's glass most glass you understand is designed by usually sand or other materials that at a high temperature or some sort of process is melted and fused it appears to be or naturally occurred and the structure of it has this bumpy wavy-- it's not like smooth glass kind of but you're not sure what it actually is make a survival check with advantage because you're a crazy ranger tracker you see tracks here and there some fresher than others yeah well two of you saw it yeah you've got one piece second piece yeah to where you came from you mean on that path you're going okay where you just came from is the stairs that lead up to the castle sure while you sit there inspecting the dirt-- grog you immediately see a cluster of recent footprints probably a day old at most that lead in towards the tunnel looks like the prints are of seven individuals feet are fairly wide masculine and heavy in step one gait appears to be smaller thinner and more feminine eight total in this room you all make a perception check okay 20 and above that'd be just you two oh yeah three all right so you three you notice the temperature drop ever so slightly in the room and in the darkened shadow you look around and you see what appears to be some sort of ethereal mass drifting away there's one round that you three get to act the rest of you have a surprise round right now grog and vex are out here checking this you guys are back here keyleth is here vax you're back here trinket's up with you and scanlan you're-- so you're over here with these guys you see one drifts out from this side another drifts out from this side and another drifts in from this side there is a cold chill that runs down the spine of keyleth and vax as they've encountered enemies similar to this in the past all right let's roll some initiatives just those three yeah i'm banning that d20 for the rest of the game so it's just you okay so initiatives (giggles) okay okay all right percy you're up first you glance around and you can see the two entities going (hiss) towards you towards keyleth and you glance over your shoulder and see one drifting out of the distance towards vax to there there you won't be able to see this one just those this one actually will block your view to that one these are about ten feet tall these are the little sections here so right now you would be able to see these two here and barely see this one it would have three-quarters cover which you ignore with sharpshooter over here okay so you can see one of them right now okay go for it okay so all of you who are going to conventions to meet taliesin in the future make sure you get a nice long hold of his hand so you can roll better too all right so that's your first attack second attack both at the same guy okay go for it okay is this with the element or not okay you fire just passes through it with no effect okay okay take a picture take a picture right now you need to go find the d&d casino d&d casino make it happen guys i know one of you can so which one is this okay that's including crit damage okay so this one the bullet does (impact noise) hit its form with a burst of flame the bullet converted to magical due to the nature of the chamber you can see its form (raspy cry) it disperses for a second and then re-forms continuing its movement okay that's stupid 15 does hit okay the ice shot (gunshot) tears through it doing additional damage you see part of its form crystallize from the little bit of ectoplasm that's floating in the air but it's not enough to actually disperse its form it continues pushing forward you would have to reload to use those again okay that ends your turn it's now their go this one drifts forward to keyleth this one drifts forward to grog no you guys were aware everyone else is surprised so unless you do anything against surprise that's true all right keyleth i need you to make a constitution saving throw sorry no a charisma saving throw did you roll already what did you get ten okay the ghost reaches out and embraces keyleth it disappears into her form and she shivers for a second and it is no longer visible keyleth's eyes all of a sudden flare up with a ghostly blue glow and she turns around looking at the group with a hunger you haven't seen in her eyes for those who see it as well-- i should have made this happen before-- i need you guys to immediately after seeing these ghosts make a wisdom saving throw no just the ones that see it that's right so never mind that doesn't matter good reminding so i was right then i didn't forget anything all right charisma saving throw correct and grog charisma saving throw nope this is not a charm 12 okay what did you roll and with that three of your teammates turn around their eyes intensely glowing with some sort of a weird ghostly glow everyone else roll initiative no you guys are already on the initiative oh no grog you still do yeah for yourself yeah (laughs) okay everyone who hasn't rolled yet rolls now 15 okay technically you would yeah all right and what did you get 13 all right percy you're up first what are you going to do she looks at you a little bit frustrated she looks about annoyed and goes i'm sorry i'm not a holy woman i have no symbols i have no power i have nothing let's see what we can do right there okay into there there we go okay so you're up against the stone there you go all right okay okay he has two so you only knock-- that crazy belt man (laughs) you turn around and holding your gun out at vax even with this ghostly form it's so hard to do so and you close your eyes for a second and you pull the trigger and in a weird way you're both immediately distraught and at the same time relieved that the gun jammed (mechanical noise) so that's your turn all right vax you're up first the ghost drives you to turn up to him as he's trying to fix the gun daggers out go ahead and make your two attacks against him no sneak attack damage pretty sure the 22 hits okay go ahead and roll damage against percy all right so you take eight points of piercing damage you feel the blade (pained cry) pierce into the side it doesn't get too far in but you haven't been on the receiving end of his daggers before and it's not fun seeing what they do to others all right at the end of your turn i want you to make a religion check 18 that gentle glow left behind that slight sliver of pike's essence that went into your symbol of sarenrae flares for a second it flares again and for a moment in your head in which darkness has taken your vision you feel your body moving on its own but you have no control you hear pike's voice whisper in your ear from a distance it says vax it's okay at which point suddenly you feel the coldness sucked out from you the symbol flares for a second and the ghost is thrust out of your form that is your turn however all right scanlan you're up that's okay indeed there we go spirit guardians so you call forth spirits to protect you for the duration for up to ten minutes your alignment is good yeah okay so here's what you do you actually use this to create these guardians-- this spell hasn't been used either to a distance of 15 feet you have to choose things within 15 feet of you so you have these two right here so these guys their speed is halved yeah yeah when they move within 15 feet of you their speed is halved and at the start or when they enter the area they make a wisdom saving throw or take radiant damage that will be at the end of their turn all right does that end your turn you get a bonus action yes take the lamest d10 you've ever accepted because harmonica's not your favorite instrument all righty great that brings us to keyleth's turn so it turns towards scanlan having cast that and you make a staff attack against him okay go for it yeah you roll a d10 and subtract that from her attack so it's a 17 roll damage okay now it has to make a wisdom saving throw which it succeeds it still takes half as much damage so roll 3d8 yes okay all righty so this burst of radiant energy burns around her you take 12 points of radiant damage yep vex you're up you see grog turn to you with this wicked grin on his face eyes glowing a pale whitish-blue as he brings the hammer up in the air you are you're right next to him you're right there yep make an attack of opportunity whiff (impact noise) the hammer hits the side of the stonework cracking it a little what are you doing vex just keyleth right now he can but he'll hit scanlan as well we'll say trinket backs up a little bit to get enough room on it keyleth swing an attack yeah trinket has to get enough distance to actually build up momentum 20 total is exactly the ac roll damage for trinket trinket takes nine points of bludgeoning damage from the staff right yeah because it's bludgeoning so five points trinket then rolls forward (thudding noises) roll attacks on grog scanlan and keyleth for who keyleth scanlan and grog all three hit all right so no attacks of opportunity against trinket roll damage and everyone takes that damage oh i know i have this it's 2d6 plus four yep ten points of bludgeoning damage eight points of damage for grog bonus okay nope it hits the shoulder and gleans off and carves a little wound across his chest but not enough to do any damage that ends your turn grog trinket due to the line slams into grog at the end of it so he is now between the three others grog as a ghost you just got shot and slammed by a bear i want you to roll one d20 15 your attention goes to vex as opposed to trinket you move out of the way that's true well the creature has to make a wisdom save fails so yeah takes 3d8 yep 17 all right you're feeling the ghostly form-- you take the damage as soon as the form inside you're feeling this dissipation all right so you make your two attacks against vex yeah go ahead and roll damage the first hammer swing you're ready for swing backward it goes long 20 points of damage (impact noise) first one didn't hit did it just 20 so as the first one misses you pull back trying to stop him but the hammer still slams you in the side you don't have time to move out of the way and it pushes you up against the wall you land on your feet and you can feel the pulsing of the blood broken beneath the skin that ends grog's go percy you're up yeah go for it all righty around here okay so you move around that way all right that ends your turn it's now their turn this one currently loses interest in you and drifts two three four five six seven eight-- it (whoosh) passes through the stone moves through and appears on the other side i need you to make a charisma saving throw yeah she dropped it when she picked up the concentration spell and that was ability checks not saving throws and with that it goes dark and a spiritual intent takes over your body you feel like you're being puppeted and you have no control over yourself you're hidden captured within your own form all right that ends his turn vax you're up you still feel the residual warmth in your glove pulsing towards percy okay yeah you're being attacked and stabbed by yourself it's weird that hits all right roll damage for the dagger what's your ac 18 okay you take nine points of piercing damage as the dagger stabs into your stomach as you swing to haul the punch off the body ducks out of the way all right that ends your turn you were there so that's 15 feet all right that brings us to scanlan there all right constitution saving throw from grog and keyleth and trinket what did you roll (thud) grog what's your dc all right so roll damage what's trinket's okay so you take half damage okay (thud) okay so you take eight points of damage grog takes four trinket takes eight keyleth top of the turn roll-- you take 3d8 points of radiant damage all right so 13 points of radiant damage to you and to okay all right scanlan that's your turn keyleth you turn around as you see vax rush up with a look of fear and intensity on his face you see her turn around with this twisted grin on her face and she brings her staff up and swings it towards your head roll an attack what's your ac 18 as she swings you duck and her staff (impact noise) smacks against the stone wall of the mausoleum that ends your turn bringing us to vex correct i forgot to add her to the initiative that's my own fault i'll give her a couple of rounds here in a second anyway finish up okay so trinket moves up to there use an action to make a trip attack sure why not roll an athletics check no for trinket make a strength saving throw grog yeah trinket rushes over and tries to knock you off your feet and you just (thud) no effect you still have a bonus action and your movement if you want to make an acrobatics check 28 grog roll an attack with disadvantage just for the hell of it okay roll damage against vex as she pulls away from you be glad it was disadvantage you take 21 points of bludgeoning damage as you pull away grog (whack) backhands you with his hammer now you can take your bonus action if you want to all right that ends your turn cassandra is going to rush up angrily with her shortsword out rushing up behind grog she's going to make a strike that is going to be 18 what's your armor class 19 she goes to strike and whiffs unfortunately she's going to attack with her dagger she pulls out in her off hand rolls a three yeah i'm giving her a second round because i missed the one she's going to angrily pull up again and attempt to strike with both a second time that will be a 20 all righty because trinket is adjacent she gets sneak attack damage so you take 27 points of piercing damage well it's slashing damage from the shortsword the offhand attack is another three going to miss all righty that brings us to grog roll another d20 11 your attention switches to cassandra roll two attacks at the top of his turn you do yeah actually before that happens roll radiant damage with that as you're reeling up your hammer to strike cassandra a burst of radiant energy disintegrates the ghostly presence within your body and you find your mind come to you as you're about to go into a downswing to smash cassandra's head in you catch yourself you have your turn now yes over cassandra what's your ac keyleth she ducks out of the way with this preternatural speed keyleth's ghostly form is too fast for you the confusion of the whole sequence caused you to not be able to think straight in the moment and you miss twice that ends your turn grog percy your gun was just fixed correct you just finished fixing this and you have a gun before you it's going to use it make three attacks against vex-- vax i mean vax whatever reduces the damage to half it's not a saving throw so it would be-- which one reduces the damage by half then it would be uncanny dodge all right so attack two more times hits and all right so roll damage three times the first one is halved so you take seven damage 15 piercing damage okay (three gunshots) all right that ends percy's turn there vax you're up currently it's just enemies so you can't move past them i could make you roll an acrobatics check if you wanted okay are you doing sneak attack on this she's adjacent to grog so yeah 18 hits they both hit so roll damage on both oh that's right so three hits with sneak attack was it doubled because you rolled a critical sneak attack you just roll the dice 25 no worries okay so 25 plus 18 25 plus 18 is 43 yep okay all right that ends your turn scanlan you're up yep through those two yeah okay 8d6 and i need keyleth and percy to both make dexterity saving throws you both take half damage you both take 12 points of lightning damage the bolt strikes through hitting both of you in the chest but you both manage to pull out of the way just in time to reduce the impact of the spell you could glance over and look at him as he pulls up to you and see him (pants) roll the healing points for that all right that ends your turn keyleth at the top of your turn roll 3d8 radiant damage keyleth falls unconscious to the ground as this blast of radiant energy bursts around her as this spiritual radiant form that's been surrounding the area and stalking the various individuals it slams into her form as she collapses the ghost is jettisoned from her body and looks like it's been taking the radiant damage and is having a hard time keeping its corporeal form all right that ends keyleth's turn keyleth i need you to roll a death saving throw you take one death saving throw failure all right vex you're up okay 16 hits 25 as you pull back the arrow and you see the flames ignite around the shaft you release it it slams into the ghost and you see its form (raspy cry) disperse from the impact the arrow hitting the wall behind it and shattering against the stone ghost destroyed yep right over there 21 hits 16 points of damage to you percy yep so you're using both blazing bowstring abilities right now okay a flaming arrow (impact noise) sticks into the shoulder and you can feel the flames burning into your body-- there you go it's now cass's turn cass who's having a weird time with the whole process of seeing a bunch of herselves and her brothers stabbing each other and getting possessed she's right there and she brings herself around the way she's not able to do any actions so she sees another of her brothers possessed but clutching the gun in the hand and is steeling her blade for the moment and doesn't do anything with her turn grog you're up what's your armor class yeah hits damage on both okay so 36 points of damage (two impacts) you're thrown up against the wall and almost pushed over off your feet from the sheer weight of the impact yeah it seems that the radiant damage from the spirit guardian spell you're doing has been doing the bulk of damage to them while they're inside the form most everything else is going straight to the individual travis and percy you have three more shots with this gun two of which are magical so you pull up the gun you take a step back you do attack of opportunity against percy if you want to take it roll damage you get additional dice it's the first time you've critically hit on this show that's absurd roll damage i want to know what it is okay you are out percy falls to the ground unconscious the spirit is jettisoned out the side that ends your turn entirely the ghost is going to shift over it does not get its possession back percy i need you to make a death saving throw by the way okay the ghost gets pushed out of the body with you on the ground and its possession not returned it reaches down and strikes at you with its withering touch you take two death saving throw losses it's an auto-crit because he's unconscious vax you're up do it all three hit 27 damage total all righty so all daggers strike through its form you see it tearing through its ethereal physicality but it's still holding its form together it looks damaged but it's still holding its form on this plane scanlan you're up you were here so 35 there you can yeah all right scanlan creepy gnome okay your death saving throws are fine okay what's the dc on that it fails its save roll 3d4 (laughing) how do you want to do this (cheers and laughter) (laughs) as you're shouting this you can see its ghostly form its face suddenly shifts into the face of a person it recalls its memories you can see its physical form become that of a young adult wearing robes that hold the symbol of the de rolo crest you see it look at its hands and you see it look at you and look at percy on the ground unconscious and it moans out in horror as it suddenly dissipates you can make a medicine check to try to stabilize her yeah 18 yeah you stabilize the bleeding she's no longer making death saving throws she is still unconscious you all reconvene take a breath for hit dice spent or just for the rest song of rest at the end of the short rest everyone gains an additional 1d8 it's nice doesn't hurt you guys take a short rest here to roll some hit dice everyone rolls it on their own it's fine cassandra looks about the rest of you still seeing a group of herself and her brothers she shakes her head for a second we can rest a moment but i don't think we can stay here much longer the more time we spend here the more chance they have of returning if they get the jump on us we're done she sheathes her sword and her dagger (sighs) let's do this as you all climb into the beginning of the excavation tunnel leading to the south slowly making your way towards-- making your way towards the tunnels beneath the city
