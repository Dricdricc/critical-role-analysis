you guys so much now that our announcements are done let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of critical role [no audio] [dramatic music] yeah sure it's fine as a cleric you have access to all the cleric spells no no no that's kind of the benefits of the cleric and the wizard is they have a larger breadth of spells druids as well she's taking power word kill so if you guys wanna get your-- any attunement changes you want to situate for the coming party company move you guys have also taken some time to inspect the other items that you received from the treasure hoard boots to keyleth and this to whoever the hammer it's a warhammer like an actual giant yeah it's thor-hammerish does require attunement by a dwarf if you have the belt of dwarvenkind attuned you can attune to the hammer as well but only under that condition if you unattune the belt you have to unattune the hammer yes that as well i forgot that on the card well that one i don't think requires attunement but she will not have her boots of levitation or no she will not have her sprinter's boots sprinter's boots will be replaced by those it's a choice to make sprinter's boots do require attunement i'll have to double-check the card from her i don't know if they do it's up to you the process of a giant armored gnome to change out her boots is gonna be-- it's not like a quick it's not pressing the 'x' button in your inventory essentially yeah (laughter) to necrotic okay technically yes well it's 20 feet and then 60 feet is the second range increment so if it's longer than 20 feet your attacks are at disadvantage but you can still attack then it would be no more roll and then everyone gets advantage against you love the dice that rolled that treasure hoard is there anybody else that wanted to-- to the dwarven thrower okay so the blood axe goes away dwarven thrower's out so just so you're aware the dice roll on that is a d8 to do damage as opposed to a d12 okay that is-- grog has that actually you have to attune to it yeah but yes grog does have the sword yeah you only have two things attuned you do you can so grog pulls the sword out from the bag of holding and as he reaches and extends it towards you you feel this sudden almost like a sudden burst of headache at the back of your mind and you stop for a second grog and you look at the blade and there across the metallic sheen of this gorgeous scimitar you see this image begin to seep through and look at you it's this female-like face very faint a reflection-- but the teeth are fanged and you see what looks to be almost like a swirl of snakes around the outside at that moment you feel that burst of headache in the back of your head grow extremely strong and you drop the blade out of your hand and you guys watch as grog falls to his knees just clutching the sides of his head the sword as it hits the ground it clacks the blade almost immediately rusts and turns into a dark dull metal the gems crack and turn to dust and what now lies there is an inert weapon you get the sense just 'cause you've seen a few things like this that this was actually an inherent curse within the blade and it just took a moment to dig itself into grog but the source of the curse is expended and grog you are permanently at -2 to all of your saving throws correcting my mistake from the card last session this was me completely either misreading or mishearing it last time as the internet let me know that was the card drawn i want to make sure that we stick to what was drawn i think grog has a way to get rid of headaches yes well until a god takes it away grog is clutching the side of his head pike just came up to you and asked you a question what do you want to try it's true if it's a curse i mean there are a few things that can usually take care of a regular curse but she doesn't understand the nature of this curse it's a 5th-level okay so as you guys are finishing this conversation grog and keyleth pike walks up and holds her gauntlet out her giant awesome monster-ogre gauntlet as it begins to suddenly emit this bright white vibrant glow she touches the front of your forehead beckoning you to bend down to try and get rid of the headache you watch as the healing energy surges through your body from head to toe and as it passes through you the light fades the spell is spent-- that's a 5th-level spell she used-- and the headache remains (groaning) there is no divine magic that can do anything about that either grog he has chainmail no the cloak can go over armor it's actually made from the flesh of a displacer beast just a legendary ring like you do just note with the ring of invisibility you remain invisible until the ring is removed until you attack or cast a spell or until you use a bonus action to become visible again all right there you go thank you siri (laughter) all right so what else do you guys want to prepare if anything as you wake up come to consciousness-- i mean if pike wants to prepare a heroes' feast pike can cast it gilmore had a few items that basically turned into a heroes' feast but he lost his shop heroes' feast it is i believe 6th-level i think yes 6th-level all right so mark your diamond that you recently found in the hoard marked off as pike prepares a long wooden table summoned through divine magic that contains a fantastic meal of all the classic westruun comfort foods instilled with the power and guidance of sarenrae as you spend the additional hour to eat and drink and gain the effect of the spell you become immune to poison immune to fear and you all get an additional 2d10 to your maximum hit points if you want to roll that laura yes well this is for everybody everybody gets this amount so everybody gets 15 additional hit points it can feed up to 12 people so yes that would be kerr as well and allura and kima well you're immune to fear and immune to poison wisdom saving throws all righty you reattuned to your bracers of archery cool all righty so it's either a creature or location only one way to find out as far as you know when you create a sensor at a location creatures that can see invisibility can see the actual scrying location the orb itself that you create the magical orb of which your vision appears through but that's the only thing you would have to consider make a perception check you find a few separate pieces of what look like quartz-like rock that line the sides of the road and the exterior garden of the castle and upon trying each one not as salty as you'd hoped they're generally just bits of whitestone or rock i mean you get a hint of salt but it's gone after the first lick after licking it a few times it gets a little shinier yeah okay so go ahead and mark three quartz rocks roughly some are a little bigger the center one is a little bit like a basketball size don't judge his collection all right as you guys are preparing kima and allura catch up to you guys they've gathered their materials and they're prepped for battle kima's fully armored oh allura she's wearing one of her many ceremonial robes that she does for presentory tal'dorei council work but you see she has a hood up over her head her hair braids are tied together behind her neck so they don't get in the way you notice that there is some really nice jewelry that's adorning the side of her neck the staff she carries with her usually is relatively simple but you see now that there are a number of runes carved in a spiral along the sides of it you can see a number of rings that she previously wasn't wearing that are on and her face is hardened and you see that she-- where normally she has this air of keeping the room-- almost a teacher or parental-type presence in the area there's an intensity and darkness to her face that you haven't really seen before not since at least the attack on the city happened (sings) and kima all right guys so they've arrived and allura steps into the room her staff clicking across the stone floor of the castle all right have we put all of our affairs in order they come in towards the beginning of the casting of the feast and they eat as well yes so how best should we arrive if you have the ability to bring us through the tree or i can teleport us there as far as the advancement of spell strength a teleport spell in its own right is the seventh sphere of magical incantation sounds like a wondrous idea kima rushes over and takes the stone from your hand and goes all right i'll give it to her be right back she jogs off you hear the (clanging) of the armor as she disappears so she takes them and is like not really my style i'll take 'em and you all wait patiently for the next six minutes as she unbuckles and pulls off the rest of her lower armor and gets the boots on no and you can see it gives her a twinge of disappointment the expansion just came out so it's like all epics and one green that's better than the rest yeah that's the worst (laughs) all right with you all gathered there allura hood still up kind of nods keyleth lead the way to the sun tree then very well (sighs) let us hope that we return here tomorrow victorious she swirls around her cloak spinning around her base as she follows suit after you keyleth the rest of you make your way marching down the front of castle whitestone to the center of the town where there you see the faint elements of green bloom now growing across the tree from where once it was bare the season bringing a sense of spring and summer that have been kept at bay for a while and for you as well percival this is the first time in a long time you've seen the sun tree showing that growing life all right so what are you focusing on for the receiving end of this with the second scrying that you did with allura which was just specifically the island of viscan you did see a number of trees not far from the rocky protrusion the small mountain that seemed to be the place where this laboratory's in so yes you can choose one of those trees you saw that would be large enough to do it (laughing) well first roll a stealth check (laughter) 14 the not-stealthy-at-all keyleth slowly approaches you you see her you make eye contact and yet she still slowly crawls up and begins taking a big whiff on your shoulder no he smells of frustration disappointment and worry (laughs) all right so do you go ahead and cast the spell all right okay so as the shadows coalesce around your bodies your legs your knees your feet you watch as the front of the sun tree suddenly splits open to reveal the pathway through across to what looks to be a partially ruined jungle you all step through the tree quickly before the portal slams shut behind you and as you guys emerge looking about you can see what looks to be a lot of heavy dirt and earth that-- there's spatterings of sand throughout and surrounding it immediately you can see there are different trees throughout this kind of-- some points are lush green jungle on the outside and the further in you go you watch as the trees have all withered black a little ways over the treeline you can see maybe a quarter-mile off what looks to be the top of the mountain that a brief instant of your first vision in your scry spell lent you towards it looks like it's a radial effect from the actual mountain yes you want to go ahead and take a look make an investigation check (laughs) you can't recall the color really that they've become but it's not alive it takes a wish spell to get rid of that unfortunately no he didn't find anything sure go for it okay as you guys begin to walk through-- it's not a very dense jungle okay so make stealth checks as well yes you do so plus ten to all your stealth all righty and a natural 20 for allura and actually-- i rolled with disadvantage for kima and it was like a 16 and a four but then she had the boots on so the first one sticks nice so stealthily you guys-- what did you roll grog with the plus ten okay well kerr what did you get a spell that she had cast on all of you as you guys fan out in this-- (computer chime) as you begin to weave your way through these trees as quietly as you possibly can keyleth you step behind and run your fingers along some of these withered grey and black fronds and branches all these trees look like they had the life force pulled from them almost like a very very rapid starvation or thirst took them but what's interesting is a lot of these trees are near-petrified and have been this way for a very long time it's not a recent occurrence kind of yeah but a sadder version if that's possible they're all like ehh i'm a bad tree you don't know that much the fact that you knew the name and a little bit of the history was even impressive by the standards of everyone here what little you do know is that he was sent away specifically because of his inquiries into how far you can reach with necromantic magics and lost history from the age of arcanum the age of arcanum was the epoch before the divergence before the calamity hit and not a lot of history exists about it a lot of it was destroyed either during the battle or people destroyed it thereafter to prevent us from reusing what led to that sort of conflict but opash apparently had gathered or at least was in the process of trying to recover some of that information hundreds of years yes there does not appear to be any new scarring that you can tell based on what you've seen so far go ahead and make an investigation check if it's dragon-related all righty there are no dragon tracks yes go for it sure yeah this would be investigation for you sitting down and getting close and looking throughout the dirt 11 you do find tracks but they're scattered and they're small feet looks like some indigenous creatures or wildlife that exists on this landscape they were all little yeah as you guys push through allura looks up toward the boughs of the dead trees while you were preparing i did some research on this island and it seems that there were an indigenous people that lived here before opash came thousands that made seaward trade routes to the north and the west and when he made this his home the indigenous people were never heard from again it is believed by many who fare the seas that this land is cursed and is to be avoided for that reason this forest one of the superstitious points of that reasoning there are a few that come through hoping to scavenge or find things from his lost whereabouts or his own hoard or treasures he may have garnished in his time but few of those return as well well if this was the lair of a necromancer an entity that is both selfish and driven towards the personal power and advancement of their own narcissism i can imagine that they are very well protected with their secrets the fact that this abode was taken by thordak before he made reign upon the southern side of the continent who knows what happened to opash yes up until he began to wander onto the continent of tal'dorei the gem we created me kima drake as far as we know if any of her stories can be believed raishan was responsible for the rituals that embedded it within thordak's chest on the plane of fire during her time with the fire ashari once again as much as we can believe let us be careful press on investigation checks from both you guys if you don't mind if you're looking for traps specifically investigation okay pushing forward you guys-- sure in a very laura bailey how much can i get out of this roll i know i know i know i'm just messing with you so as you guys push forward you vax notice that the further in you go towards this mountain the trees still dead grey are even further withered and many of them have just turned to ash and dust and the closer you get the actual treeline grows thinner and lower as it seems like the closer it gets to the mountain they're bereft of most of their structure you do vex catch as your brother is moving forward he is stepping towards a section of the earth and sand that has slightly different texture ever-so-slightly from the rest and he's but a few feet from stepping into that space what do you want to do you look down and you-- it looks almost like-- it looks like the difference between sand and slightly damp sand the coloration is just ever so faintly-- i mean it looks different from the rest there's no mechanism there you don't see a pulley or a-- it's avoidable it's like a ten- 15-foot oval area now that you've identified that you've come across a few more patches and they seem to grow more dense as the trees grow more withered and gone until you get to a point where you can now see the base of this mountain make a nature check 22 these are less siphons they're more what looks to be-- it's a phenomenon known as hollow earth which is when subterranean caverns go into collapse it can create a sinkhole-like phenomenon but hollow earth generally is based on some sort of magical release an explosion of magical energy beneath the earth that causes-- even though there is no space it erodes the earth from its magic presence whether it just completely disintegrates or destroys portions of the earth it leaves this very very unstable portion of ground you're not entirely certain what it'll do but it's not good okay as you take the rock and throw it into the sandy pool it lands with a little bit of dirt being kicked up around it and sits there for a rest the rock then goes-- it just falls underneath and you can see a spot in the ground perfectly shaped where the rock was that is now just-- they are not leaning a specific direction yeah and it isn't like there are were leaves or anything blown off of them it just looked like they gradually just died rapidly in place yes you can and you guys maneuver around these spaces to get to the base of it and it's a moderate-sized mountain nothing impressive on the outside it's maybe 600 feet tall at its apex it's more of a large rocky mound make a perception check there's nothing in here why do i keep trying to sip but what's your bonus to perception okay so close you guys being at the front of the party anyway-- as you guys scoot forward being ahead of the rest of the party you glance across the surface of this and most of the rock follows the familiar pattern of tectonic shift that's broken and cracked in places but it's been over hundreds and thousands of years just settled into its natural state there is one section of rock just maybe 200 feet from where you are landing at the base where it looks like the texture the natural lines of the rock is in a different direction and upon you heading in that direction you can see now what it appears to be is a large rock very large maybe 20 30 feet wide that is jammed into an entranceway kind of there are a number of strange holes peppered over the surface about the size of a-- larger than a gold piece each hole possibly you have to check it investigation okay thank you sir so are the rest of you guys following up behind them okay between the two of you glancing you notice that each one of these holes is actually a pierced intrusion upon the rock something very quickly jammed itself into the rock to create this hole and they're clustered in places and you with your experience these claws are respective to the size of a very very very large dragon and it looks like different-- some of them are more weathered than others this boulder has been placed and pulled back and placed many many times throughout the years you guys are hanging back i mean the boulder is larger than the entranceway that it's jammed into and you're not entirely certain what the inside of this cavern mouth is if it's just a direct intersection point or if it's a gradual influx you can just try and push through at one of those points if you'd like they already checked it did not appear to be trapped just a very very heavy rock i mean you'd have to go around the entire mountain oh maybe at full speed hour and a half two hours this accounts for you flying stopping checking flying stopping checking you can't just check for traps while going by at 50 feet around are you gonna scry okay yes you can all righty so using your divine sense let's see here okay so you spend your time just focusing making sure there's nothing either in or in the immediate vicinity of the rock boulder that could be of celestial fiend or undead nature while you spend a spell slot to do your primeval awareness so yes you do sense what appear to be three sources of dragon life force within the space roughly in the direction of this mountain and below i believe it's-- for that one it is for one minute per level of the spell and it's within one mile up to six miles if you're in your favored terrain it's not wooded anymore so it's one mile so you know at least they're within a mile was that in character so what's the plan guys yeah okay so what are you giving him how do you make the pouch the shape of cards make a sleight-of-hand check with disadvantage go ahead and roll a perception check grog the trade is complete she hands you your deck of cards she takes her parapet of wound closure if you pull the right card yeah so feeling satisfied that your imploring of vex and a trade you've made your shiny package of happy cards are back in your possession but you promised at the moment at least-- while she's right there in front of you yeah all right so what are the rest of you doing in the meantime okay so using stone shape you can-- a section of stone no more than five feet in any dimension and form in any shape that suits your purpose so you can make a small passage as long as it is no more than five feet thick the wall and the stone are both thicker than five feet you can begin to make a slight passageway you can create enough of a crack with your spell as it completes which mark off your 4th-level spell but as you create it you do manage to pierce and you can look into the darkness of the tunnel behind but through the full use of the spell you create this kind of tunnel intrusion into the side of this mountain and you only get that much of opening okay perception check keyleth in the descent okay all right so you pull back the arrow you fire it through the arrow-- go ahead and make an attack roll you fire the oracle arrow at just the right angle where it doesn't hit any of the walls it just arcs off straight before it eventually begins to curve and what you do as you pass along with this arrow with your darkvision you can see down the tunnel there is no light source there is a layer of untouched dust all across the ground and interesting texture the further in you go and then eventually about 100 feet or so in the tunnel begins to curve to the left and descend before the arrow lands and sticks into the rock there splintering a little bit and your vision now sits there with the arrow there doesn't appear to be any movement it is silent and pitch-black from what you could see from the arrow rushing past it yeah it's about that big yeah you could reach your arm through essentially it's like the edge of the wall of this tunnel and the rock were kind of jammed together and she punched through just enough to push past where the rock and the wall had hit and it created this slight opening but there's still a bunch of stone there okay all right (creeper hissing) i mean it could be but one spell's already been spent but it would work make an investigation check 17 looking around as they're having this conversation there's no switches but you do see fingerholds like big dragon-sized fingerholds like something grabbed it and jammed this boulder in there yes will it damage the sword you ding it you pay all right so who's doing the leverage okay well the size of the sword at most it's going to be one person assisting the main person which would be pike assisting grog all right so as the rest of you guys get on the other side grog i want you to go ahead and roll a strength check with advantage because of pike's aid on this 23 okay as you guys get on the other side before you even start getting into position grog already begins to pull back on the sword you watch as kima keeps glancing over her shoulder like (worried noise) waiting for it to just snap but the large rock the boulder begins to shift ever-so-slightly you watch as dust and other small pebbles begin to clatter down the outside of the rock you all get on the other side and all together as a group everyone else make strength checks straight strength so add your strength modifier okay okay so you manage to get about a foot and a half-- okay so trinket's also pushing as well there isn't a whole lot of surface area here to really aid it's mostly on you grog and you manage to get about a foot and a half wide before you pull out the immovable rods and kerrek and anybody else who wants to help you manage to jam them into two of the finger-holes and as soon as they lock in you can release the weapon and it's just enough to hold it in place although it is slowly moving each rod can only hold 8000 pounds mind you it's not holding it entirely aloft it seems to be holding okay for now you guys all pull through kima immediately rushes and grabs the sword you guys charge into the darkness you guys all do get inside the tunnel the boulder does appear to be stationary all right you guys now stand in the 15-foot-wide about 12-foot-tall tunnel entrance to this mountainside as you saw before the floor itself has a layer of dust there's a heavy smell of ancient rot and stagnant water and wet earth the rock walls of the pathway are rough but appear to have been intentionally carved for a purpose more than any sort of presentational element of it there's no wind there's no movement of air everything in here has been at least in this portion of it still and untouched for quite some time as you guys push forward through this tunnel to where it begins to make its slow descent-- you guys all right that was investigation 24 okay we'll have to make-- we'll say make new stealth checks since you guys have come out of stealth and you're back in but as you guys are moving down the curvature of the tunnel vax you notice that there are amongst the dust and pebbles of the floor small pieces and chunks of other material most of them very small maybe anywhere from a pebble size to the size of this die or a little larger and they're different than the rock they're a lighter material and almost porous upon close look as you take one and look at it you've seen this before actually in a subterranean place once before although it was a large field of it at the time there are a number of scattered shards of bone just kind of scattered and cracked and broken across the floor not a very thick mat but just here and there peppered throughout the walkway you also do notice upon looking at a few of them on the ground now having the context a lot of them look blackened a lot of them look like they've been charred burnt you don't know it looked like you're at this point and then you're there so you have no idea no traps at the moment no you guys are going stealth right all right so roll your stealth checks please great awesome all right so as you guys continue progressing down this curving tunnel it goes into a very very mild descent make a nature check on this actually this is your understanding at least of how fire against bone which is-- 28 yeah so understanding especially in the pyrah and noticing the difference and just your experience of natural animals and creatures that have been cooked to be eaten and the effect of the fire on the bones that are left behind this bone charring is not as ancient as say the trees that have withered but they're aren't-- they're years old at the very least if not longer yeah there's a layer of dust on these bones as well that shows that at least they have been untouched for a short time yeah he made this his lair after avoiding death from j'mon sa ord in ank'harel and then recuperated here from what you know and then made this his domain for a while and then pressed northward in tal'dorei which is where-- correct that's when thordak battled raishan and began the beginning of the formulation of the conclave that's when thordak destroyed byroden and by proxy their mother that's when all of that went down okay so that's a 4th-level spell off pike and for the next eight hours vex is death warded to be fair i'm still toying with it because it's one of the things that i'm adjusting as we go that's not true at all oh i can keep it if you want it's a rule that i'm working with i may have jumped the gun in releasing it at the time as i'm working on the campaign guide but one of the resurrection rules i was deciding the dc i think five per death is a bit intense so i might adjust it more to be a two just 'cause i was thinking in a long-term campaign your character might die a lot more between levels one and 20 and then it gets a little insane so i'm working on it mind you she's still closer to death but yes yeah in fact currently percival and kerrek are blind like pitch-black blind all right-- there you go well done the dagger which emits flame on it is the equivalent of a candle he can see about 15 feet beyond you and that's it there is now a flame licking the edge of the blade that's being held aloft so light is being shed now in the tunnel though not a lot all right so kerrek there's a moment of quiet and stillness in the darkness as you feel the ground beneath you shift ever-so-slightly heavy footfalls approaching you as suddenly a large muscled somewhat sweaty arm just curls around the outside of your shoulders and pulls you close to grog's torso so you guys are making your way down this slow grade beneath yes you make incremental checks as we go eventually as the grade continues downward you begin to see the hallway open up ever-so-slightly and what was once just somewhat rough rock walls begin having slight shapes or details to them it's still hard to see darkvision is-- you still need a little light to make out fine details or things at a distance but it does help you at least make out the basic shapes and things ahead of you you see what appear to be small shelves or alcoves that are now beginning to show up every 20 or so feet as you progress down little bits of rock that jut out that look like they were either bolted in or crafted on top of it and you see small little cubbies almost little alcoves that are put into the rock as well okay make a perception check okay you glance in the first one to your immediate right which is a small shelf outward and you see what appear to be a number of dust-covered-- a cluster of candles that have long burned and melted into dripping wax that pours down the side of this alcove that's it on that particular shelf okay so you're searching for traps now go ahead and make another investigation check with disadvantage let me double-check here it's kind of a frustratingly broken ability in some cases if it just is universally in here so you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light so you have about 15 feet you can kind of see out in front of you in straight darkness if you have your dagger out you can see pretty decently for 60 feet is how it works kinda shitty in 15 feet for at least 60 feet for you okay nothing seems to catch your attention as you continue pushing forward you see one more of these shelves are you looking at each one as you go okay as you glance past another perception check 22 okay you can see on the left shelf appears to be a humanoid skull that's up on top next to two more candles one of them more melted than the other but the wax drips past there's a shelf across the way on the opposite side that appears to have a couple of small books that are put off to the side and what looks like a small wooden box roll an investigation check box does not appear trapped from what you can tell okay continue walking okay as you continue keeping an eye out in front of you the next shelf you come across looks to have some sort of a mummified racoon-type creature that is propped up (laughter) kind of literally just shriveled kerrek do you have something you wanted to say you do sense that there is some sort of an undead presence in your vicinity kerr though you do not quite know what its nature is or its direction there is something undead near you correct i would say it does not appear to be any extreme-- yeah it does not appear to be an extremely powerful undead presence you can't tell size or direction by any means but it's not like all of a sudden there's a lich ahead of you or some massive arrival of orcus you just sense something around you that is an undead energy okay do you guys all continue moving forward what languages do you know you do not know the title of the books all right roll another investigation check 25 okay you continue to push forward there is no trap set you do look ahead and see what appears to be the pathway is now showing stonework at times almost like there are slabs elements of a tunnel that was once better constructed than what exists but is either eroded away or elements of wall collapse have covered what was once a very very ancient form of architecture it does say that i totally missed that got you okay then you sense there is something you know it's from one of the wall areas but you cannot see and your one single bit of light source is ahead of you in the tunnel but you do sense at one point as you're walking it is to the left of you are you stopping 'cause you two are moving ahead of everyone else so you guys are probably a good 15 20 feet ahead you want to move back with them you do you glance off to the left you can see upon that shelf unit there there are the two candles and the singular skull set on the shelf okay kerrek you feel grog slowly step in the direction that you pointed out to him it looks like a human skull no it looks kind of dust-covered you can see what looks to be-- the bone itself appears to have a hint of blackened soot or some sort of a darker color to it like it's been slightly singed candles look like mostly melted candles make an intelligence check or make a religion check make a religion check okay best that you can understand is undead magic can raise dead it can control dead you have heard stories of undead or the use of them being more situational as opposed to just roaming as zombies but that's as much as you can call off the top of your head it's been a while since you've been adventuring so the specific stories are a little too foggy okay it is the skull is the source of the undead energy it is not currently moving or reacting or having any sort of reaction to being held by you that's a good point what is your guys' marching order by the way i know the twins are in the front grog and kerr keyleth and percy-- ash and scanlan after that and then we have-- do you have trinket out of the necklace right then probably kima and allura back with trinket in the back so they're kind of holding up the rear and keeping an eye out behind as they go okay so you pull out the extra kind of a heavy burlap sack you throw the skull in there tie it taut and set it back up on the shelf facing away from where you're standing every time continuing onward into the next length of the tunnel about another 50 feet or so there is-- the room opens up and you can see that stonework eventually takes the entire floor and the chamber opens up into what looks to be almost like a hexagonal-shaped chamber that ends at a large iron door it fills the entirety of the chamber and it seals off any progression from that point make a perception check sure okay so 15 total okay as you glance you can see at the center of this chamber there looks to be-- let's see here okay yeah there stands a pillar of dark green marble about ten feet 15 feet away from where the iron door is and what looks to be a roughly forged bowl of iron that is imperfect and is bolted to the top of this pillar resting on top of it and it's about maybe five six feet up and there is a platform that leads up to it so maybe if you were standing on the little dais around it it'd be about chest-height to you the chamber's whole height would be about 25 feet you also see off to the right what appears to be another shelf that contains a very very large leather-bound tome and what looks to be a cold iron brazier that is unburnt but has a bunch of dried tinder in it you have a tiny bit of candlelight you can see about ten 15 feet around vax you do not even know there's a door there make perception checks there does not appear to be anybody else in this chamber with you and from your divine sense you do not sense any undead within 60 feet of you right now he doesn't sense any undead within 60 feet that's the range of it the doorway you mean no you're entering this chamber then on the opposite side of the room there is a larger door that prevents you from progressing beyond the doorway in between you and that door there is that raised platform the pillar and the iron bowl and then to the right and against the wall there is the brazier and the shelf with the singular tome glancing up based on your perception rolls you don't see anything that would dictate any sort of exit or entranceway from the ceiling no there's standard stone old stone masonry you can see chunks that have broken off and just fallen over the years there's a couple small cave-in areas where it looks like rocks have just tumbled in as the general shifting of the island has caused some elements to fall loose and tumble in okay that gives a bigger radius comparable torchlight to keyleth and now kerrek and percival you guys can both have a much better view of the room you can see now this iron bowl on top of this pillar in the center you can just make out the large iron wall or door on the opposite side and a little bit of the brazier and the tome make an intelligence check 19 best you can glance here i mean it's possible but this-- you don't know the room itself is ancient and the construction there is nothing that appears to be mechanically attached yeah there's no chain pulley system visible at all where the door hits the seam of the room it looks very smooth sure you can make an investigation check right (clears throat) as you look down into the bowl you can make out what looks to be a very very faint long-dried residue just at the very very bottom of it some sort of a liquid that was once in there that has since dried up entirely and left this very very faint just a slight shift in texture other than the hammered iron not that you can really tell no you're just looking into this dark bowl with a little bit of light source your wings yeah kerrek as they're having this conversation you're looking watching as this small half-elf rogue that you've had a few encounters with suddenly just sends this pair of large jet-black raven-like wings that fire from his shoulderblades and slowly fold behind him you're scraping the-- okay it scrapes up it creates a small almost like a dried powder-type substance it's like a dark burgundy yeah taste it has kind of an iron-like taste the leather tome which is currently leaning up against it has no text on the cover and no text on the spine but it is big it's about that big so it's like a tome grog do you want to go over and check it out okay it appears to be a thick leather it's hard to tell in this light if it was made from tanned hide or tanned flesh but it is old you can hear this heavy sigh from allura behind you she's like (sighs) i'm just this is my first time actually adventuring with you oh don't get me wrong it just reminds me of my early days as an adventurer and i forgot just how ridiculous we were so yeah there's the iron brazier and there's a lot of dried-- inside there yeah i don't know there do not appear to be holes in the ceiling no 24 looking at the book are you taking it off the shelf or are you-- looking at it it looks like it is just resting against the wall the shelf unit is not trapped the book itself does not appear to have any sort of connection to the wall you can see the pages themselves are weathered old stained but intact currently percival's a step or two behind you as you're saying this the book (impact) and hits the ground it scatters open so you take the dagger and you place it over there you don't recognize the text and you try and focus on it too and you don't recognize it either it's like the more you look at the text the text gets smaller and smaller and smaller until it's microscopic it just looks like a mess of symbols and details it's weird it's almost like as you get closer the perspective keeps shifting away from you to where you cannot actually make out or read the text in the book as of right now it looks like there's just text as you go through every page seems to have the same sort of reaction where as your eyes try and focus in the low light the text just gets smaller and smaller and just avoid comprehension there is a title and as you look at it the title itself seems to be blurred and obscured and begins to shrink as well it's like trying to put on a pair of reading glasses that won't focus she comes over kerr what are you doing as you get close and look yes the same thing your vision doesn't seem to focus on the text the pages seem to just hide from-- okay as he pulls his warhammer in front of him you watch as the head of it the spike in the back-- so what would've been the back of the hammer the front of it is like you said missing entirely and it just blazes forth with radiant energy like a giant glowing metallic end of a weapon (lightsaber sound) as it happens the room is now much brighter and you can see the details of the stonework around you the mustiness seems to almost back away instinctually from the radiant light itself almost warms the air in its vicinity it's very weird strawberries probably as the light hits the pages the pages go almost blank the text just shrinks away to the point where it looks like there's just tiny tiny dots okay the head of the warhammer flickers out leaving just the handle behind you go ahead and look at it and the text is more legible there on the page but it's still blurred to your vision scanlan glances over it's fine to me i don't know what your problem was no i have no idea what's on the pages i'm just messing with you (groaning) allura who's-- oh so you're going to light the brazier with your hand okay so the room fills with light once more kerrek you can bring your hammer back if you'd like yeah you guys are just charging around okay your hand hits the top of the kindling at which point the wood catches and there's a slight flash as the extremely explosive materials that were within the brazier detonate causing percival allura vex and vax who were also reading the book nearby to all have to make a dexterity saving throw as there's a sudden (explosion) it explodes with a force you don't make it you just take the damage since you were at ground zero that's right so you go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw as well kerrek kerrek what'd you get oh allura made it okay everyone but kerrek made the saving throw so kerrek and keyleth you both take 32 points of fire damage the rest of you take 16 you take none because you're a rogue your ears are ringing from the blast of the impact the brazier's just all the metal's just bent outward and ruined as keyleth turns around you can see just her hair's blown back a bit she's like a cartoon character the door is not open the book has burned entirely it is destroyed and you see allura who made the save but took some damage is at the back and is kind of chuckling to herself goes well i think now we know the purpose of the book it was well-played and curse be on the one who thought that up it was a sort of mixture of extremely flammable liquids it was not black powder okay so as you uncork and let it flow and it's thick syrupy it hits and it pools a moment passes two moments nothing okay the basilisk blood that's still in there you bleed into the basilisk blood and it pools in the center of it and you watch as the blood that you just dropped gets pulled beneath the surface of the basilisk blood and out of sight from the few drops of blood you put in there it has not opened from the pillar about 15 feet okay the door begins to shift there's a slight shaking sensation as the bowl itself begins to glow and the basilisk's blood begins to sizzle and burn away almost like it's being pushed to the outer edges of the bowl with just the singular drops from your blood resting in the center the room begins to shake a bit and you watch as dust that had been alongside the ceiling begins to slightly cascade from above you the metallic door lifts up and reveals the other side it's open you do take a point of damage from the blood that you lost so you guys are just starting to push out of the room at which point you begin to hear laughter cackling multiple-sources laughter (cackling) and you watch as down in the distance of each side of the hallway from where you came and where you're going these little sources of light suddenly spark up and begin drifting towards you okay what does that do okay all right so yeah that's on yourself and it creates a 30-foot radius around you as you guys all see these sources of light hovering towards you the cackling getting louder and louder from a source just out of view pike grabs her holy symbol and slams her hand down onto the stonework in the center by where the pillar is as it hits there's a (explosion) sound as the vibrations or impact shift through the ground and you feel the ground itself grow warm with radiant energy as a giant circle of ancient radiant runes begin to connect and intersect and within that circle you all kind of rush in and as you do you feel the warmth of that protection come over you as you all gather with your weapons at the ready you see now the sources of light as roughly four floating flame-wreathed skulls come rocketing in two from each side of the hallway cackling along the way and we're gonna take a break (yelling) flaming skulls just floating towards you you get the sense that one of these may have at one point been contained within a bag all right so we'll be back here in a few minutes we're going to go ahead and take a restroom break and we'll see where this next chapter is welcome back everyone to critical role we're back from break the party just found themselves immediately surrounded by large floating flaming skulls in the center of this hallway going towards the necromancer's sanctum i need you all to roll initiative please while they're rolling their initiatives we had a winner in the chatroom for a wyrmwood zebrawood complete dice tower system right here as well as this awesome leather thing from wyrmwood here they have this nice leather band as well the winner is heartman_ by the way congratulations heartman_ delightful so congratulations we'll get this to you asap all righty so getting initiative scores here from people 25 to 20 yes all right so whoa scanlan's always in the rear that's awesome vax and scanlan at the top all right 20 to 15 percy vex 15 to ten all righty you can hold an action meaning you still take your turn you still move but you can hold your action for a trigger so like i will hold my action to attack if something comes in range or i can hold my action to cast a spell when a certain creature does something but you still take your turn you don't move the turn order pike at the end kerrek what'd you get oh kerr it's okay you and kima are down there all right so all righty so at the top of the round as these skulls are beginning to find their way in towards the cavern towards you as you've all circled around pike in the center of this chamber here i would like scanlan and vax to go first you can okay so scanlan is gonna go invisible and back up here all righty 2nd level casting the spell is your action okay so you back up against the wall there okay so that's your turn vax so over here okay i'll put you up on here right here okay go for it both hit so 19 points of damage total awesome that end your turn all right that brings us to keyleth as both these daggers slam into the skull you watch as the flames themselves that are kind of wreathing around them the skull just ducks out of the way but the blade still catches and scrapes across the side of the bone and it has to right itself but then it gets right back into the place it was it's taking damage and you can see portions of the bone are starting to crack and break but it's still you know still holding itself aloft not yet it's not its turn yet it's an action to chatter i'll get you he-man no (sings) oh my god do i pray anyway sorry oh internet never change so what are you doing for your action keyleth no what are you doing on your turn next to allura and you have kerrek to your other side you were heading this direction the giant gate was here and it lifted up and then all the skulls swarmed in from that side there's four there's two on this side two on this side okay so constitution saving throw on each of these guys here okay so you can hit one-- oh if you hit there you can hit 'em both all righty and they-- that is a 16 and a 13 so no they fail 'em both (cheering) 13 points of damage to both of them so as the beam bursts out from the sky you see the white radiant nature energy burst around them and the flames seem to subside for a moment as the one that's already been damaged by vax almost stumbles to the floor then picks itself back up its flame flickering more so than the allies around you that end your turn keyleth you gonna stay where you are or you gonna move no no one's been on the carpet over here okay more south that ends your turn all right it is now the flame skulls' turn so all four of these skulls you watch as the flames swirl around the head pour into the skull itself and for a second the flame almost goes dark as all of a sudden the eyes burst into angry fire the mouth grows extremely bright and a single red beam streaks forth from the jaw to the center of the room four of these beams in different directions here followed by four simultaneous familiar explosions as four separate fireballs rock the room yeah you guys clustered right there well no you guys said you all were gonna back in around pike and you haven't had your turn yet i know i know this happens guys sorry not knowing or seeing where sam went they all focus here which will affect everybody so i need everybody to make four dexterity saving throws now mind you-- everyone except for scanlan all saving throws you have advantage on you're trying to beat a 13 yeah for each one trying to beat a 13 everyone was there okay grog okay so you take 76 points of fire damage percy okay so you take-- grog i said 78 right sorry 72 that is 48 points of fire damage to you percy sorry this is a lot of fireballs and a lot of rolls right now so for percival altogether if you made all the saves it would be-- shit okay we'll say for the sake of this and the ease of the damage here you take 56 points of fire damage percy 56 points of fire damage yes you technically would've taken-- no you took 70 that's right you failed two so that would be you take 88 yeah so how many did you get keyleth okay kerrek how many did you save so you take 56 points of fire damage yeah so you take zero you just duck out of the way vex 56 points of fire damage okay pike failed two 88 but half that because she has fire resistance so 44 you can bring him out and heal him in a minute if you want to that brings allura through her barrier and extra hit points that brings her to-- okay there we go and kima also failed two so she took all righty going forward you can yes from the curling flames of the arcane blasts unfortunately not that much cover from that however they all then go ahead and scoot back towards the wall the holy radius itself is starting to affect them so this one is starting to back up in this direction and these two are going to go ahead and this one's going to curl around the fallen stonework and land there that is going to end their turn now that brings us to percival's turn yeah that hits so roll damage for that okay as you take your first shot the one skull's just trying to duck around the partially crumbled wall you catch it right before it goes behind cover and as your bullet hits from the side the skull just explodes and shatters into a burst of flame and broken bone expelled and extinguished on the battlefield they are not hits okay all righty so this shot impacts and it sends it slamming into the wall and it rights itself back in its position but you can see noticeable cracks across the bone cranium of it and little bits of fire are poking through areas where it's starting to come apart but it's still keeping itself together at the moment 16 still hits that does it another blast echoes through as the gunshot goes off you watch as the secondary light source from that side of the hallway just is immediately extinguished that hallway goes dark once more the two glowing lights untouched on the area you came from still standing i like how keyleth is becoming your paper clip for this battle that's true that would affect your rolls you would get plus three to any-- so it didn't help grog pike is the only one that's near you that would've gotten the benefit okay so take 22 points of fire damage off-- or no it would be half that 11 points take 11 points off correct just saves so what'd you roll as your final rolls so that would've made 13 roll so yeah that would've all of them would have been 56 even with the plus three all right percy that ends your turn vex you're up okay there you go okay okay got it (laughs) okay he has been hunter's marked well there you go you double the dice yeah so that's 20 plus eight plus another eight yeah that secondary arrow happens to just hit right on the suture at the side of the skull and as it hits the arrow cuts through and causes the skull to crack in half and you hear this kind of shriek and the laughter fades as it pulls back and the flame just flickers out and the two pieces of bone just clatter to the ground and break across the stone okay so this way 30 you can get about there all right that ends your turn vex grog you're up you get right up to it okay go for it go for it that hits you don't add the extra d8 since you only get that when you throw it 26 damage oh i see what was the damage on the first one oh okay welcome to d8s motherfucker okay you slam across the side of the skull it slams against the side of the wall where you hit it and as it rights itself you go with your second attack which does hit roll damage for that one 19 hits or 19 damage sorry whack you slam it again this time it falls to the ground and picks itself back up the flames brightening once again the anger as its jaw clacks open coming towards your face yeah he's not frenzied i'll just grab your mini and slam it into the ground no saves not like this okay so go ahead and make your athletics check since you are raging you have advantage on it okay so you-- there you go all right this is allura's turn she sees currently at the moment that the heavily damaged flame skull and there's nothing else in the immediate vicinity she glances past steps over past kerrek and says shall you or shall i you're too kind and with one hand on your shoulder and her staff in the other she thrusts it forward and you watch as four what looks like small beads of arcane energy go rocketing out from the top of the staff and arcing around each other as they swell with power and force all slam multiple times into the side the magic missiles dealing five ten 15-- four fours in a row-- 20 four fours in a row and that's not quite enough to finish it it's taken 59 points of damage you watch as-- to each roll well so we'll say given that circumstance it's okay given the fact that it literally had one hit point left-- it had one hit point left so as the four missiles slam into the side of the skull the final one hits and its jaw gets blown off as the rest of the skull just turns to ash against the stonework and slowly rests across the side the combat coming to an end in that moment you came from this way yes this way yeah you went this way okay so grog just goes bolting through past all of you guys into the currently unexplored-- you just caught him as he moved past the partially collapsed part of the wall where the one skull was trying to hide which actually now that i think about it i need you to roll four concentration checks on that one for pike so four constitution saving throws yeah okay so she maintains concentration but you have roughly 50 seconds 45 seconds okay so as they're having this conversation you push past you don't notice anything trapped but about 30 feet from where the iron door was as you're scoping the floor just turns to darkness and as you peek over you see now a set of stairs are descending no traps short rest is about anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour okay you sense the same three dragon presences in the vicinity don't forget you guys using your hit dice you get scanlan's song of rest it's an additional d12 on top of whatever you healed you then get an additional d12 that's overall not on each dice yeah just overall yeah heroes' feast is addition to your maximum hit points which is what 235 for grog percy where are you at okay vax you didn't take any damage kerrek what are you at okay no worries he did yeah 95 got it heroes' feast yeah one that'll be going up to where vax is okay so scanlan backs away extra d12 to by-proxy do this yeah okay go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw 19 all right great as scanlan takes the flute and takes in the fumes of the char-burned suude the familiar burn and chemical flavor fills his lungs and as he exhales this fine brown smoke emits from his lungs and his vision clarifies suddenly and he feels this elevated sense of energy and power in his mind for the next hour scanlan has one sorcery point that he can spend as the sorcerer metamagic class and has access to the extended spell metamagic ability so he has one point period that he can ever spend for the next hour correct and basically he can spend it to double the duration of a spell as he casts it that's-- the suude gives him access to a specific metamagic based on the color of the suude and he gets a point the more you use to get more points the higher the dc gets and the closer you get to overdosing yeah a single spell that has a duration he can use that sorcery point to double the duration of that spell correct so if it's one minute concentration it can be two minutes concentration no the duration not the casting time those are different the duration is once you cast it how long it lasts before it expires actually no it says specifically as part of the metamagic ability that it has a maximum of 24 hours so if it already has a 24 hour duration you cannot that's a beautiful quote all righty no traps you came to the edge of the stairs that lead down for about 20 or so feet and then progress an even path and then disappear below what your visual is able to see from above okay go for it yeah it's still currently being the central source of light in this room from where you are you can see all the way to the bottom of the 20 feet of stairs but the roof of the tunnel cuts off the rest of the path so you have to go out further to look out where it goes cool got it okay stealth first no because she cast-- 25 okay and then make an investigation check you make your way down the stairs into the next bit of the hallway no traps the stonework here now is getting a little more refined the further you go and as you look out the hallway you have another 25 30 feet of this 20-foot-wide 20-foot-tall hallway before it seems to just end and drop off and you can see what looks to be the gap in another wall about 25 feet across from that and then just a wall on the other side yeah looks like it goes down or up you'd have to get closer to get more detail trinket can use his own hit dice to heal if you wanted to that's fine okay so yeah you can go ahead and heal him up vax you move ahead okay as they start catching up with you you hear them stepping down the stairs behind you you come up to the edge and now what you see is a 25-foot circular almost cylinder there is a ceiling maybe about five feet above you and nothing there but what you do see is about a three-foot-wide spiral staircase that just leads down and down and down and you cannot see where it ends at the bottom empty space down the center of it and it's just a two-and-a-half- or three-foot-wide staircase that goes along the edge and that's all you have to walk on okay 18 okay as you slowly drift down keeping your wings you hover further down maybe incrementally ten feet at a time looking around looking at the stairs you don't notice anything trapped it all seems pretty standard the stones are old they're a little smooth at the edges what were once kind of very very rigid and square protrusions from the stone seemingly have a little rubbed off as you get closer to the bottom and as you get about roughly 100 feet down before you actually reach the bottom but you begin to see below you there are right in the center of the spiral downward a cluster of four-foot-long kind of deep brown or maroon-colored iron spikes that are all just jutting upward in slightly off-kilter directions and there is a very very heavy pile of splintered bones and long-mummified dead corpses that are currently just piled up at the base of these spikes some still impaled many of which have slowly rotted and fallen apart the carpet can carry 600 pounds that's roughly four people or a grog 800 pounds grog and maybe two people you currently have ten people traveling with you there is a very very-- kind of where the outer trim is of the stairway the stonework travels around it and then underneath the stairway there is a small opening that leads into a further passageway okay i mean just glancing around the archway it's not a closed doorway just an archway and then a dark tunnel beyond that it does not appear to be trapped okay so who's doing what okay you guys just threw a bunch of stuff at me right now you flew back up okay so you have scanlan you have pike okay you guys enter the center area and begin coasting downward you notice a faint blue glow above you in the ceiling as you glance up you watch as a glyph begins to slowly-- dispel magic from scanlan right now okay have scanlan go ahead and roll an ability check for this 'cause he can't cast as a reaction and this would technically be your reaction as it's already been triggered i wanna have you go ahead and roll an initiative check huh this would be a charisma plus six and plus two it's plus eight to whatever you roll but first i need you to go ahead and roll initiative technically you would not be able to do this as it's not really a reaction not for the ability check on dispel magic 19 that's 17 so yes go ahead and roll a d20 and add eight 21 okay as he streaks upward and releases the spell you watch as the glyph that was glowing-- so you guys manage to continue all the way downward flying you place both of the gnomes at the base safely by the spikes you and one other person could probably get on you go ahead and begin to carry kima down without an issue yeah okay so you grab allura bring her down below most of you made it down kerrek has not come down-- keyleth hasn't made it down yet grog hasn't made it yet so you've carried everybody but grog kerrek and keyleth it doesn't seem to be having an effect right now kerrek's pretty heavy i need you to make a strength check it's a bit of a strain with the weight of his armor and getting up in his years versus your tiny half-elf frame but you do manage to bring him down without issue yeah it's just the two of you up there no he brought keyleth down so it's just you the carpet takes you off the ground you have to kinda get your-- okay you go into a pseudo-nosedive it's thrilling and scary at the same moment and as you're going up grog just goes past you and it just barely coasts past the spikes and lets you fine on the side yeah it's not super fast magic carpet can go about as fast as a person especially this size the smaller they are the faster they are this is a very big one but not very fast indeed all righty so as you guys have reached the bottom of this cylindrical chamber you follow suit one by one which by the way just so i know going forward what's the marching order right now grog where are you at percy where are you at trinket is out now okay so moving forward following vax's lead-- okay so the hallway's probably 20 feet wide and 15 feet tall as you push forward the walls are chiseled rather roughly and about 30 feet forward ahead of you you can see it ends at a cross-section of what looks like a very deep ravine both above and below there is an underground chasm here that stretches both to the right and left though you'd have to get to the very edge to kind of see how far it goes it's about 60 feet across to the other side and you can see what looks to be another entranceway to another hallway and there is a taut rope bridge bolted to each side leading across your wings went out before the battle and you took a long rest your wings are pretty much done now 30 minutes to an hour between riding everyone up and down i'm letting you know right now mr already flying everywhere your wings are about expended that's up to you do you want to keep flying until they're gone or do you want to sit there okay okay so you get about five feet out before the wings go (fsh) looking down you see darkness and there's a few stalagtites that-- you're attacking just the wall above or-- 20 okay the dagger hits the edge and you appear right at the edge of the cliff you're gonna try to reach and grab make a dexterity saving throw okay so you grab and get up on the other side you didn't even really fall for a moment vex you're floating across and it feels strange going across there's no wind but the broom is acting extremely wobbly and the way you control it and maneuver around you feel almost drunk but you're not this is not acting properly okay so you head back okay you take your hands there holding and you put your foot out onto the wood and it's sturdy it's strong with druidcraft you can create some small vines that wrap around it and it might help in some regard but not a lot druidcraft is a very limited cantrip make a dexterity check all right so you get your d12 inspiration die dexterity saving throw that's really good all right so as you start stepping out you feel this shift in the space and you grab on to the edges of the-- right and as you glue the boots there that's really what solidifies you in place and you're still there on the bridge without a problem it feels weird you can't quite understand what's transpiring but it just feels weird i don't think it's drunk per se it's just that you're not used to flying in that direction and she points out towards the ravine and you watch as percy who's kind of holding onto the ravine feet solid his hair is just up as you hear this conversation it seems that way yeah you do so make it across the way the wood shivers a little bit shifts beneath your feet being pulled upward from your weight you guys watch as the bridge that was once taut is now arcing up and following percy as he moves across his weight pulling it upward as you fly out and spin yourself underneath-- yes you do actually manage to fly essentially barrel roll across and manage to make it across to your brother without an issue vex vax and keyleth as you guys are having this conversation something catches the corner of your eye and you watch something just go (tss) just whizz past from the bottom of the ravine to the top you saw something quickly just go by yeah the three of you guys make a perception check as you kind of come up to the edge and look this is not related to dragons all right so you're seeing little things just right out of the middle of the light you can see something shifting above and below you you guys have a little better view you still can't quite see-- the length of your darkvision is too far for you to see what is below you or necessarily what's above-- yeah so you're still off to the side just holding onto the bridge okay you are beginning to watch what looks to be figures humanoid bodies just tumbling past one of them hits the edge of the bridge and it keeps spinning off as it disappears into the darkness above you watch a couple more go by and they are nearly skeletal bodies falling upward but as you watch a couple more go by they're limp somewhat but still moving as they scoot past you wait about a minute or so before one comes close enough to hit the sense but there is an undead energy that passes past and both you and kerr have this moment from across the ravine from each other seeing this three or four more stumble past and they're getting more and more rapid and they're different sizes they do not appear to be the same bodies okay barrel roll across as you're making it across three more come tumbling up two of them too far away but one of them does reach out with its arms as it tumbles past you and swats out to try and grab you i need you to make an acrobatics check she's the one driving the broom she's having to try and maneuver right as you're watching them start going across you get a step out onto the bridge-- that's an attack roll war gods don't help you survive they help you kill shit understood but before we get to that so the creature grabs you and essentially grapples you in the moment as that happens the momentum of pulling you up causes the broom to shift out of whack and you begin to careen in a slight circle i need you and pike to both make strength saving throws they're about 30 feet from you about the same so you guys are on the other side of the ravine so okay so pike's on the broom with you you get grabbed and yanked off the broom pike manages to hold the broom but currently pike is not the current driver of it and so she's clutching a broom that's just floating in the gravity you watch as both pike and vex go from careening off to tumbling upward into the darkness above no vex is pulled off the broom she's still tethered yeah right now the two of you can both make an action because of the nature of the rapid movement you are at a disadvantage on this attack okay she's falling up right now she's about 30 feet out from the ravine and now tumbling upward she's about 50 feet from you misfire the vine unfortunately only has a range of 30 feet she's 30 feet out from the center of the ravine and is now 15 20 feet up in the air the opposite side maybe look i'm trying to work out-- you guys do a lot of things really fast i'm trying i'm working with you so please bear with me on this i wouldn't recommend doing that or i won't give you a chance to even do it don't taunt the dm so i'm going to ask you keyleth to go ahead and make just a general dexterity check this is how fast you're able to enchant a spell which requires an incantation and the release of the spell's effect thus summoning the vine and causing it to lash out this is just a general base dc i need you to go ahead and just roll and add your dexterity modifier so as bad news misfires you watch as the front of it just this burst of black smoke bursts outward and this look of utter horror on percy's face keyleth rushes out and grabbing the edge of the rope bridge to get enough of a reach out there you watch as her hair lifts up and part of her body begins to just drift upward but she holds on and reaches out with the staff and using the strength of her force of will the edge of the stone above the ravine cracks open and suddenly you watch where there is no life a piercing flash of dark green shoots outward a vine freshly grown from the edge of the stonework reaches out and grabs wrapping around the broom itself and holding it taut you watch as the vine and the entire group shifts upward you're suddenly pulled you're still grappled by this undead zombie-like corpse and pike is currently clutching onto the broom as hard as she can as you both impact at the end with your weight and the creature's weight i now get to see if the-- well not the vine the vine magically holds it's the chain that attaches you to the broom yeah okay so that holds it goes taut you're held there the creature's still clutching you right now your arms are held to yeah actually 'cause you're still held there i want you to go ahead and make another acrobatics check 25 so it does not progress into restrained you're still grappled it's still holding on to you but you manage to swivel out of its grasp as it's trying to pull you in and it's starting to try and bite into you as you glance upward now that you're drifting dangling roughly 60 feet up you look up and you can see what is the top of the ravine and it is a writhing mass of hundreds and hundreds of undead corpses that are all reaching out for you their different-boned claws all extended going (rasping) trying to just pull you towards them into empty air as you dangle looking up into that at which point the vine pulls the broom pike you and the creature up towards the edge of the wall so you're still 30 feet up but you're slammed into the side of the wall now the vine is just holding the broom taut against the edge of the rocks go for it it's going to attempt to bite attack you by the way which it does not do with a two just getting your armor gnawing on the leather you add your dexterity and your proficiency modifier so it would be plus ten i think okay yeah so you jam it with the dagger go ahead and roll damage that's 1d4 plus your dexterity modifier it's a d4 plus five is what you're rolling for damage okay so eight damage you jam the dagger up into its jaw and throat and it slaps it out of the way you can see it's damaged but it's still holding on the creature's now grabbing onto you and slamming you into the wall best it can pike is just holding onto the broom right now she's going to attempt to-- actually what she would do in this moment would be turn undead 'cause that's what clerics do it's not a spell it's her channel divinity ability yeah you have to be closer from there okay so it has to make a saving throw which it does not make so as you look over and this zombie's biting at you and you're trying to jam at it pike who's holding onto the broom grabs the symbol of sarenrae from around her neck and looks up and just closes her eyes for a second and as they flash open again there's no pupils just white bright vibrant radiant eyes this small shockwave bursts off her and you watch as the zombie goes (gasps) just turns into ash and disintegrates its body just tumbling in chunks and pieces up into the ravine above you yes and then up at where the zombie went pike is below you still holding onto the broom i don't know keyleth a few more corpses start tumbling up yes they're about 30 feet above you guys on the opposite side no the vine is attached at a base it's almost like it grew out of the ground so what grasping vine allows you to do is you can-- wherever it's based at it pulls it to it it doesn't do damage what it does is it just grasps and pulls towards it so what you can do is each turn you can change the target if you change the target it's gonna release the broom and they're both gonna tumble up not without casting the spell again all right so you start reverse-rappelling up the side what's everyone else doing grog kerrek and keyleth are all still on the other side with kima and allura they're all on the other side of the ravine the rug is still with them it's on the other side nobody's taken the rug across-- okay so you rappel up the side while they're holding on there one more corpse tumbles up past it's going to attempt to-- right now if you were to try and take a shot you could try but you'd be at disadvantage for all your attacks okay well one comes tumbling past what are you doing kerr okay so kerrek hops on the carpet and it begins to lift above the ground allura-- allura watching this happen grabs kima and dimension doors across to the other side sets kima aside and just stays there waiting carefully and one other person of equal size which is only pike and kima technically but kima's already gotten across so you're just waiting kerrek and keyleth are going across are you guys going just directly across or are you going towards vex and-- all right so you guys as the carpet heads out you hearing the carpet as you move forward kerrek you barrel roll the carpet and begin heading upward to float underneath where pike and vex will be as you begin heading upward it's funny you mention that what were singular bodies tumbling upward are now groupings four or five almost chained together like these small balls of just limbs and bones and gnashing zombified teeth begin just (falling sounds) upward one of them slams into the bridge and scatters out sending a number of bodies spinning outward broken arms and limbs from the impact the bridge itself cracks a bit and you watch as the center of it is still being held by a rope but it is currently not overly walkable without holding the rope to get across one of these clusters starts making its way upwards towards where the carpet is correct you have not driven a magic carpet before i would ask you to go ahead and let's see for this make an intelligence check go ahead and make an intelligence check just a straight d20 plus your intelligence modifier well plus your modifier whatever that is your intelligence modifier okay so moving this across you're basically watching this thing come careening upwards and you're trying to shift out of the way to maintain momentum and have this not impact you but both the nerves of what's happening the unfamiliarity with the change in gravity and not running a carpet before you move out of the way just as it slams into the upper corner causing the carpet to shift and quake oh man you guys were heading upward so if you were to kick her off she would probably still arc upward at this point you guys are essentially in theory you're below the ravine if this were normal gravity you guys are about 30 feet across 'cause the movement speed of the carpet is if i recall from what i told you right it was 30 feet not yet you're halfway there so as they get hit percy has just made it up the wall to you and pike double-dash got you there okay well first and foremost first and foremost oh man this got really complicated i love it it's great i-- okay i would like both kerr and keyleth to roll strength saving throws to maintain hold on the carpet they're about-- right now 35 40 feet yes you do from being just near him he's so awesome that when you're near him-- paladins man 14 okay kerr you both maintain your grip on the carpet i will say for the sake of this keyleth make a concentration check yes you do you just need to beat a ten okay so you maintain concentration you maintain hold of the carpet the carpet rights itself the corpses go spinning upward into the abyss above the carpet has now spent the rest of its turn getting into position to guard you and pike just in case it's necessary so you guys are in place percy you've tied the rope-- right now it's kima and allura as well you guys all grab the rope that's currently affixed to percy that hopefully you've been holding this whole time i'm imagining you would've okay so you go ahead and start pulling the rope kima and allura help out allura's not doing much eight unfortunately but kima is okay cool so now we have kerrek and keyleth keyleth are you releasing the vine because it's currently what's holding them against the stone wall they both have ropes they're grabbing onto from percy and they're being pulled below do a strength check gust cantrip is not gonna be strong enough to push anyone of your weight cantrips are very simple 21 good so between you and kima you both begin to just hand-over-hand pulling the rope as it's taut up against the edge and upward vex pike you both begin being pulled upwards and kerr you're lifting with keyleth keeping that you guys get right to the edge you look down as you see this one cluster of what looks to be maybe 20 or so bodies comes up not as a ball but what looks to be almost a giant skeletal hand made up of smaller corpses is tumbling upward and reaching its outstretched large maybe 15-foot-wide grasp towards this carpet okay so what is your save dc for your spell dc 14 okay hold on just a second real fast so for your channel divinity here it's eight plus your proficiency bonus plus your charisma modifier 15 15 yeah all right cool so with that i'm enjoying this quite a bit okay so as this giant skeletal hand reaches upwards to basically scoop up the entirety of the cluster of everyone gathered right at the edge of this ravine the carpet pushing them inward it's almost gonna sandwich the party into the palm of this you watch as kerrek clutching the edge of the carpet reaches up from beneath his armor and grabs his own holy symbol clutches it firm in his grasp and looks upward shouting a whispered word that doesn't reach anybody's ears but the ones that it's intended for and as it does you watch as a piercing bit of light jettisons in an upward-- or downward direction from your perspective-- towards this hand as it reaches out its outstretched zombie fingers it bursts and as it does the hand is scattered outward in a small shockwave all the bodies once linked are now sent into separate disparate spinning corpses that all reach out helplessly as they all go scattering past upward and disappearing into the ravine above with that final push you all get down on the opposite side of the ravine safe and sound grog and scanlan are waving from the other side of the ravine just scanlan's arms crossed and his eyes are very wide and he's kind of looking around i know so what do you think yeah you're right let's go you watch as scanlan and grog turn around and start walking back from where you guys came a giant impact as behind you another sphere of these corpses slams into the bridge causing it to snap and go limp against the upper portion of the ravine yep upwards okay go ahead and make a strength check scanlan and grog they're still going past and it's like little singular ones here and there but every now and then a cluster chain of returning is-- what's the range on that i want to say we have it set at a 30-foot range it's a big weapon are you attaching it to your hammer so yeah that has a furthest range of 60 feet 60 feet has passed i'd say you've probably hit a good minute little over a minute since the very beginning of this endeavor probably a little longer given time to look over it since it happened and converse about what to do all right so you jump onto the broom steel yourself trinket happily allows that anchoring to happen you barrel-roll across across the way-- there are-- there's a small cluster that comes by and a couple of minor individual bodies on this side make two dexterity saving throws you just whip past out of the grasp you hear the clacking of bones-- you make it across to the other side there you see scanlan waiting arms crossed foot tapping at an accelerated rate grog waiting finding another vase to throw and all of a sudden you watch as vex comes streaming across and eventually rights herself back up to your position her hair falling normally flat to her side you don't 'cause you're on the other side keyleth high-fives her from across the ravine so grog a familiar sensation once you're back in that chamber i described to you once before you go to get to the broom and he just latches onto the side of your leg i'm fine here you actually magically restrain him with the rope of entanglement so he's bound in a spiral fashion to the actual broom as you get on top of it begin to cross to the other side okay at this point you watch as another corpse tumbles past and looking downward not a hand but what looks like a giant face emerging built of various pieces of zombified corpses and bones the mouth opening almost to try and swallow you as you zoom over that way make two dexterity saving throws the first is against the singular zombie lower dc she will be in just a moment first one she's not second one she will be no it's her and scanlan correct or whatever your dexterity saving throw is first one you zip past without an issue and that's when you look down and notice the giant face coming up second okay 27 the mouth comes up to try and slam shut around you and as it comes up you just arc out of the way you guys watch as the jaw begins to close and just as these jutting pieces of broken bone skulls and shoulderblades that make this weird makeshift mouth of this entity begin to close and slam shut you watch as the broom just barely catches out of the top of it arcs downward and makes it across the way without impact just as vax finishes his blessing spell on her you've all now made it across safely to the other side of the ravine here grog you're released trinket comes up to you and starts licking the side of your face so what are you guys doing all right so you push forward-- check for traps okay investigation check wow better now than a moment ago all right so as you guys push forward into this dark chamber now the humans i imagine you still have your warhammer out for light kerrek so you have enough of a radius where you can kind of make out the scenery and such as you progress forward about 45 50 feet further down this path you see what looks to be a small structure built into the ground almost like a multi-tiered statue of some kind and you hear what sounds like a very faint bit of trickling rushing water you're not quite sure yet as you approach you look at it and it appears to be a fountain like a small structure that contains what would be a bowl for water and then a central smaller tier that opens up into a smaller bowl and kind of a jagged edge to it it looks a little sinister and at the very top looks to be a humanoid face that's stretched into this ghastly horrified expression of terror and gasp from its mouth is pouring a small trickle of water but it is upward and it's just spilling onto the ceiling where it's just pooling and separating into cracks the path continues past it it's just in the center of the hallway correct okay you toss it towards the fountain the pebble clinks and the fountain is empty it is dry on the inside right now on each of the lower tiers because the water that is being poured from this face is trickling upward and hitting the ceiling it's this steady constant stream you throw the pebble into the fountain it just kinda comes to rest it looks to be just a stone ceiling and the water's just hitting in one particular spot if you want to roll a perception check okay you glance up and from what little bit you can see with your darkvision the water appears to be impacting something that has a different surface than the ceiling stonework it's smoother shinier it reflects a little bit of light it's about 15 feet up at this point no the path continues past it just straight okay so vax continues forward okay so you coast ahead keeping an eye out there are no traps but you do sense that there is some mechanism involved with this fountain okay okay make an investigation check as you walk up the edge-- what's your actual perception bonus okay you make it up to the top and as you glance in you can see there's some sort of a green emerald-like gem that is embedded into the ceiling that the water is just trickling onto no no it is not residuum it is not processed whitestone it is an emerald-like gem although it is imperfect it is not you know a jeweler has not cut over it to make it a beautiful gem it is a little rough it's hitting the gem and it's kind of just pooling around it and sifting into cracks and being drawn okay so you spit at it and your spit still kinda arcs downward normal gravity then it hits the water and just gets caught up in the water yeah make an investigation check there is no light in this room other than the source of kerr's hammer 20 on the fountain okay there is best you can tell some magical source this is connected to something you're not entirely sure what i mean you see-- there's no gems based inside the actual fountain itself the only gem that's-- yes there is a magical essence to it yeah if you want to once you pull it in the bottle it rests back into regular gravity it smells it smells very stagnant hard water-ish like pirates of the caribbean or it's a small world yeah yeah it's not the clearest of arrowhead it's cold you looking ahead the tunnel continues and you're starting to see more and more of the essence of reclaimed stonework you can see whereas previously this ravine was an actual semi-natural tunnel that pushed forward the walls begin to get more brick-like it's looking more and more like a really really old for lack of a better term temple or structure where you can see there was care put into its design 15 feet so what's the plan okay you continue to scootch forward okay so you guys stay back there okay kima and allura stay back waiting for you guys to scout as well okay you guys make stealth checks again okay you guys begin to very very slowly make your way up ahead and you watch as the path ahead of you begins to-- the ceiling begins to grow higher and higher and the hall begins to widen open a little bit and begins to split in two directions like all of a sudden the tunnel breaks into two different paths with the ceiling rising and growing wider on each of those paths as it presses forward you're starting to see portions of it are still the cavern-type feel but once again you're seeing more and more sections where it looks like all these walls at one point were carved stone and had a specific purpose and then over time once again portions of it have fallen to disuse and ruin currently not yet no okay so you use another spell slot vex the sources are still ahead of you they're still present and still in the direction you guys are facing in that direction 60-foot radius up there no there is no sense of anything undead fiendish celestial not where they currently are no what are you guys doing okay so you just move on okay you guys continue and gather at the edge of this fork you can see a very very faint bit of light coming from both sides of the fork just glancing off a distant opposite cave wall both have a very very faint bit of a light source two of you guys make since you were up front first make perception checks if you could 24 glancing both ways for you it splits off and they both seem to curve around in almost like a rejoining direction or at least they get close to it the split is less of a split and more that there is just a large column of earth that splits what would be a wide path the two paths eventually seem to join again on the other side a little bit of light source apparently on the other side of whatever this pillar would be or at the other side of each of these different paths that it's just barely reflecting off of the cave walls enough for it to give you the essence that there is light further what are you guys doing what are these guys doing are you catching up with them okay allura and kima are um are you certain you want to do this right do you know whether the purpose is a good or a bad one i know you've survived thus far on that mindset that's surprising but do what you will just-- she takes a moment kind of steps forward and looks at it let me see one of your jugs she takes it sets the jug right in the stream and releases it and the jug sucks up and essentially covers the gem and the water just kinda spills across the sides huh my theory was wrong well i was trying to-- and you hear in the distance behind where you guys came from (impact sounds) what sounds like many many many things falling cracking impacting which as kerrek says this and you all look back you watch as hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of bodies are now tumbling back down into the ravine below from where they came don't make this any whiter please the water's still going up and it's still careening and falling through the cracks it's not a very strong stream it's just this-- like a small faucet turned on it's all just trickling upwards appearing but that gem being currently blocked seems to have had an effect on the room behind same marching order as before you're still on the same stealth roll you had before okay the floor doesn't appear to be trapped as you coast forward around the other side it looks like a ceiling it's about 25 30 feet in height throughout this chamber as you curve around you notice that the rocky walls become just stone you see these grey brick walls that begin to turn as you turn around you see a faint light source from a series of candleabras that mark the edges of this square-like chamber there are two distant cages in the far corners that seem to bear some sort of slumped unmoving bodies inside them there are two pillars in the center of the room that appear to be just strewn with carvings and glyphs from top to bottom surrounding them entirely two large scaled crimson eggs lie placed against one side of the wall seemingly untouched and on the right-hand side of the chamber at the base of one of these cages you see a withered and long-dead corpse of thordak the cinderking folded and sagging you see a tome propped up against a bookstand on the far end marked by a singular page where a series of bookshelves and chains line the walls of this apparent laboratory you see at the current opened tome across the way arms crossed and reading quietly a tall female with dark green hair and silver shimmery-like skin facing away from you and we'll pick up for that next week 'cause it is late patrick are you gonna join us for skype next week oh shit dual skype maybe well let us know please
