[water bubbling] 001159219 --> 001202519 [thunder] 001202519 --> 001204400 [explosion] 001204400 --> 001210574 (chanting) role critical role 001210574 --> 001216845 [dramatic critical role theme] 001216845 --> 001225315 and welcome back good job liam 001335790 --> 001339891 so last we left off the mighty nein after being pulled through a series of pirate adjacent 001349019 --> 001355498 and straight up pirate adventures across the swavain islands here in the lucidian ocean on the 001355498 --> 001401068 ship the squalleater under the captain avantica's rule you made your way to darktow 001401068 --> 001408630 where you attempted to find a way to discredit her find a way to not be dragged into her 001408630 --> 001415620 business in the future it got a little messy but you managed to avoid it coming to too terrible a 001415620 --> 001422033 head until you are brought into her ship last week where a battle unfolded in which most of you 001422033 --> 001427939 managed to skitter away with the contents of this journal that you had taken from her as well as the 001427939 --> 001434437 translation for the cipher that was used to write it managed to make your way to the plank king in 001434437 --> 001442603 time and have him bring his resources to the docks before any more of you could be further destroyed 001442603 --> 001450434 summoning a demon helped as part of the distraction as well as patiently waiting some 001450434 --> 001458440 quick thought process moments you guys did pretty damn well you managed to just break enough laws 001458440 --> 001506874 to be put not in favor of the plank king but managed to have done a large favor enough to be 001506874 --> 001512890 let leave and never return taking the hobbled ship that you guys had busted with you you made 001512890 --> 001519822 your way out into the open ocean heading northeast from darktow and the dragshallow reef 001519822 --> 001528541 in search of the possible shipwreck that started fjord's destiny in the direction of uk'otoa after 001528541 --> 001539220 days of travel and a few location spells cast you managed to find a blip at the base of the sea 001539220 --> 001547561 using your newfound ability to instill the ability to breathe water within the party around you you 001547561 --> 001554442 sunk to the bottom holding onto cannonballs and began to walk the bottom floor in search of the 001554442 --> 001603960 shipwreck eventually coming upon a valley caldera that slowly sinks down you noticed aside from 001603960 --> 001611951 the whale that just skimmed your presence the bow of a derelict wrecked ship sitting there 001611951 --> 001619069 surrounded by seaweed in the barely-visible creeping daylight making it this deep in the 001619069 --> 001629716 waters so with your lights aglow and the wreck before you mighty nein what do you want to do 001631188 --> 001634234 we'll get to that because there was a note left here on my table that i almost forgot because 001739971 --> 001747437 the game has started this was written and left behind by logic as he passed through earlier it 001747437 --> 001750031 says flip over and read as soon as the game starts 001750031 --> 001751496 you sir matt are the sexiest being in all of neverland sincerely your boo logic 001759149 --> 001803094 (laughter) 001803094 --> 001804371 thank you buddy 001807364 --> 001810211 yeah i know loading the gun against you guys for the game tonight it'd be pretty funny 001813922 --> 001816116 there you go 001817011 --> 001819506 make a perception check 001832062 --> 001833546 with disadvantage because there's no light here and it's a very short range i'd say 001841567 --> 001844082 because you guys extinguished all your lights when the-- 001844082 --> 001845267 if you want to 001849226 --> 001852341 with disadvantage 001902260 --> 001903621 because you do not have darkvision and it's very dark under here and the distance is very 001909438 --> 001911298 short you don't have any lights up 001911298 --> 001912206 you extinguished them when the whale came by you can put the lights back on if you want 001915876 --> 001917438 that's true you do have darkvision 001920336 --> 001921412 okay there you go six 001922911 --> 001923890 12 okay 001925081 --> 001926560 got you eyes of the grave you don't sense anything gathering your attention as you attempt 001931293 --> 001938303 to reach out your essence to feel for any undead presence nothing but the very cold waters here 001938303 --> 001946756 beneath still keep you a bit chilled it is very cold down here looking around best you can with 001946820 --> 001955259 the lack of light aside from the swaying bits of seaweed that are all fluttering up and slowly 001955259 --> 002000751 swaying reaching up hundreds and hundreds of feet before the darkness takes them you see the bow of 002000751 --> 002005267 that wrecked ship not much else catches your attention 002005267 --> 002007804 it's the tide's breadth 002013759 --> 002014925 perception check with frumpkin 002042987 --> 002048376 still a shipwreck there is a shipwreck ahead of you guys 002052182 --> 002056639 as you do step across the surface of the sea floor there are bits of the silt and sediment 002102444 --> 002106277 that clouds around your foot with each footfall 002106277 --> 002112639 okay 002129676 --> 002134433 yes so you take and you tip it back the thing is in order for the liquid to leave the 002142196 --> 002149466 vessel you have to send air to occupy the space there's a transition there but you're breathing 002149466 --> 002153097 water so it will mix water with whatever's in there 002153097 --> 002154401 i mean you're not having to siphon it like gasoline as soon as you open it it begins to 002214983 --> 002221995 diffuse into the nearby sea it's very briny alcohol 002221995 --> 002227234 this darkened cloud is filling around nott's face 002231146 --> 002237467 you guys begin to approach stepping carefully towards the base of this the ship 002313943 --> 002320827 where it's sitting it's resting at an odd angle the front of it the bow slightly angled upward 002320827 --> 002331092 you can see the side where this large explosion tore through the hull already for as long as 002331092 --> 002337907 it's been there which has not been but a year maybe tops you can see the rust and the 002337907 --> 002345498 barnacles beginning to gather and claim the shipwreck to join but that's best you can make 002345498 --> 002349173 out with the lack of light down here 002351645 --> 002355844 you'd probably have to go around a little bit but yeah you walk around the opposite side 002419451 --> 002424848 of it looking in you can see there's some damage you can see there are holes blown out on 002424848 --> 002429319 the side that you were facing as you curve around you can see where there's a large gaping 002429319 --> 002432394 hole in the side of the cargo hold 002432394 --> 002440388 you did hear tale of him passing through nicodranas not too long ago 002624434 --> 002626471 as you guys have gotten closer to around the side of the ship where the most extensive damage 002658266 --> 002705207 was taken you can see where the top of the deck and the edges are blackened from a fire that broke 002705207 --> 002711543 out probably during or shortly after the explosion but before it sank fully the edges of 002711543 --> 002715611 the cargo hold that are blown open-- as soon as you begin to peer in the inside you can see the 002715611 --> 002721304 interior is blackened as well amongst the other patches of sea life that have begun to reclaim it 002721304 --> 002730483 as a home and bits of seaweed and general sea vegetation that has begun to find its way inside 002730483 --> 002731863 the empty ship 002731863 --> 002739257 make a perception check 002754167 --> 002757230 <i>nein</i> as you begin to swim into the darkened interior holding the sword in front of 002802009 --> 002810647 you it doesn't seem to react adjust or give you any sense that it is able to guide you in any 002810647 --> 002813843 particular direction 002813843 --> 002820696 okay frumpkin's octopus form makes his way into the cargo hold of the tide's breadth 002844286 --> 002849067 wreckage go ahead and roll a perception check for frumpkin and take a look around 002850500 --> 002856074 unfortunately there's so little light down here even for the darkvision there's the basic 002902554 --> 002910390 outline of the interior hold frumpkin can notice the outline of pieces of broken crates and other 002910390 --> 002916996 elements that may have once been stored within the ship but very little detail is visible 002916996 --> 002920970 well if you haven't yet then you'll be doing it now 002952303 --> 002954147 one way to find out 002955355 --> 002956982 okay it emanates and lights up the immediate vicinity the balls don't give off a lot 003016928 --> 003021782 of light they're not torchlight in comparison they work in conjunction to create a larger space 003021782 --> 003030802 of light but it does help a little bit with that benefit looking in the space you can see there 003030802 --> 003039587 are no bodies there are no signs of any individuals who were on this ship but you also 003039587 --> 003044957 know from your experience on the sea that those who die at sea usually float to the surface 003044957 --> 003047911 yes you do see some metallic materials that have grown rusted you can see the shattered 003054984 --> 003101381 crates that i mentioned before a lot of them are burned and destroyed as frumpkin drifts past one 003101381 --> 003107688 of them you look inside there may have been some metal bars or some sort of a construction-type 003107688 --> 003113971 iron material but it's mostly melted and fused together in fact as frumpkin makes his way 003113971 --> 003117488 around all the elements of metal that were immediately in the vicinity-- it looks like there 003117488 --> 003123209 was a cannon there were some other bits of-- all you can make out is debris at this point but 003123209 --> 003128573 other things that were metallic in nature that have since bowed and fused from the heat of the 003128573 --> 003132041 explosion and the fire than ensued thereafter before it sank 003132041 --> 003137049 now because you guys don't have air in your lungs you're not buoyant to the point where 003215170 --> 003218673 you're not fighting weight it brought you to the bottom easier so you didn't have to swim your way 003218673 --> 003223806 underneath but now you're here the cannonball is unnecessary to weigh you down 003223806 --> 003226026 essentially you arc over and you land on the deck for a moment as you glance around it's 003233212 --> 003240048 very spooky to be back in this familiar place in a very different setting it's a strange ghost-ship 003240048 --> 003245109 type chill that runs up your back looking around and having flash memories of pulling up the anchor 003245109 --> 003251440 on that side and having conversations over that edge at sea you and vandren having a deep 003251440 --> 003254564 conversation there under the main mast 003255764 --> 003259559 okay you swim through the door it's currently open and the hinges rusted and pulled 003309605 --> 003316656 off and the tops of the doors broken and akimbo you make your way into the darkened interior 003316656 --> 003324719 chamber the door to vandren's chamber is closed what do you want to do 003324719 --> 003326699 yeah go for it roll let's say a perception to see if you see anything strange or 003350998 --> 003353040 out of the ordinary 003353040 --> 003354295 14 doesn't look like there are any traps affixed to the door 003358247 --> 003400886 there's a bit of a rust resistance but you're pretty beefy you shove it with your 003407449 --> 003412501 shoulder and it opens up you can see all the silt get kicked off and slowly cloud the space 003412501 --> 003415044 around it as you push the door open 003415044 --> 003417540 you step through and look inside you see the familiar quarters of vandren though they look tossed 003425290 --> 003427415 as you look inside there's the table where he normally sat and read his books that table is 003435465 --> 003442546 set over the shelf is pushed over looks like most everything in here has been in some way 003442546 --> 003448615 shape or form tossed you remember there being all sorts of decorations that he kept in here 003448615 --> 003456095 metal candle holders it's all missing 003456095 --> 003458845 at first glance 003500258 --> 003505853 make a perception check 003508368 --> 003511751 oh buddy 003514889 --> 003516319 you just stand in the doorway as opposed to doing a thorough investigation of the room and 003523729 --> 003530597 glance around and begin tying memories and moments and getting lost in that headspace you 003530597 --> 003535226 do a not-very-thorough check over the interior 003535226 --> 003541754 okay you're doing a thorough investigation of the interior roll an investigation check as 003644277 --> 003647701 you rummage through the wreckage 003648581 --> 003650167 okay looking through and moving some things aside because you're a sturdy tiefling pushing 003658773 --> 003706476 things out of the way while you're off you glance underneath the table in the far left corner you 003706476 --> 003719769 see a reinforced metal box somewhat melted along one edge just faintly it's left open the lock 003719769 --> 003726897 mechanism on it appears to have been broken by brute force where it was forced open there are 003726897 --> 003734015 some heavy claw marks along the edges where the metal itself looks scarred the interior as you 003734015 --> 003740385 pull it open and look inside is set with a leather recess on each side top and bottom soft 003740385 --> 003749593 leather with two halves that are somewhat spherical like to hold a small apple 003749593 --> 003804116 yeah you cast locate object concentrating on the orb let me have a quick glance at this 003824568 --> 003829136 all right 003830844 --> 003834509 okay so you're not looking for the orb that fjord has something similar to it 003845969 --> 003846666 okay you do suddenly acknowledge-- your head pulls at the back of your skull and you 003855103 --> 003859120 glance over your shoulder away from the ship 003859120 --> 003901352 just as everyone else returns and comes in the chamber 003906814 --> 003907541 (slurping) the tentacles wrap around and grasp 004003224 --> 004005111 it's like a reverse facehugger 004009616 --> 004011291 roughly the direction you know you sense it's probably between seven to eight hundred feet 004027714 --> 004029375 from your current location 004029375 --> 004035592 okay 004041829 --> 004043360 make an investigation check 004102495 --> 004105917 make a nature check 004120359 --> 004123275 okay 004126316 --> 004127025 okay looking at it the claw marks are probably roughly an inch to an inch and a half 004135416 --> 004141089 apart and there's four of them it looks like an indentation for a thumb across one side almost 004141089 --> 004146734 like whoever was grabbing it was pulling it open this way and as they pulled it open their 004146734 --> 004150009 fingers scratched across the metal as it bent and broke open 004150009 --> 004150910 as you guys finish doing your once-over of the chamber you find a false shelf bottom under 004220212 --> 004227502 one of the bookcases that was toppled over as you pull inside it looks like it may have been what 004227502 --> 004235128 this box was inside it has been pulled open and broken the wood compartment partially shattered 004235128 --> 004241317 in the front looking through this room has been pretty ransacked 004241317 --> 004244060 yeah what remains of the handful of bound leather tomes in the vicinity have mostly joined 004251264 --> 004252519 the muck at the bottom of the ocean 004252519 --> 004254171 okay going through you go through a number of cabins chambers this isn't an incredibly 004313870 --> 004322235 massive ship it was mainly used for sailing and for transport it's strange for you to go back 004322235 --> 004329013 once again following through caduceus and looking and finding your old chambers as well a lot of 004329013 --> 004338137 the rooms from the explosion have been destroyed because of your generally perceptive persona you 004338137 --> 004344413 can see elements where this explosion happened there are stains of individuals that may have been 004344413 --> 004346769 in the proximity but no sign of their bodies 004346769 --> 004347659 you begin to piece together the power and the source of this detonation and you get caught 004356229 --> 004400914 up slightly thumbing through the memories and remembering the people and the faces that used to 004400914 --> 004411828 serve on this ship with you remembering the room where sabian stayed wondering if sabian 004411828 --> 004418547 survived who else may have but he also was the one jumping from the deck when the explosion hit 004418547 --> 004427982 everything has been cleaned out this appears salvaged somebody has come through here and taken 004427982 --> 004429553 from the interior 004429553 --> 004435201 i mean there are a number of creatures of folklore and things that are greedy no matter 004500474 --> 004502565 where they live 004502565 --> 004504312 make a history check 004507886 --> 004510618 i mean there was one other time that you encountered creatures that seemed to be gathering 004524512 --> 004534856 and hoarding things that were shiny and happened to be affiliated with underwater existence 004534856 --> 004536304 where are you exiting 004548185 --> 004554974 okay make a perception check for me 004557358 --> 004600332 in your excitement in having this thread of possibility towards recovering this third and 004626163 --> 004633563 final orb from what you understand you immediately turn around and swim and dart outward 004633563 --> 004640145 towards where the deck is into the open waters just as your eyes clarify to see three large 004640145 --> 004646967 figures that are floating about 20 or so feet ahead that seems to have encircled the deck in 004646967 --> 004651644 but a split second you can immediately make out their outline you can see the sides of the 004651644 --> 004658603 frilled head you can see the long fish-like lower torso and you can see the familiar tridents 004658603 --> 004700413 with chains affixed to the edge 004700413 --> 004703046 let's roll initiative 004705992 --> 004707443 it seems that in these darkened waters light sources can be very easy to see 004713819 --> 004716384 it came like this busted up 004749527 --> 004751047 laura and marching order if you don't mind of who was behind fjord 004754903 --> 004756551 yasha probably right behind there 004804096 --> 004806545 all right caleb takes the rear 004809063 --> 004814229 beau said she was behind yasha 004818062 --> 004820001 that's up to you fine caduceus inside there all right then there's beau and nott 004828105 --> 004831058 chilling with caleb all right 004833100 --> 004835688 initiative order please 25 to 20 anyone 004902129 --> 004903954 20 to 15 004906643 --> 004907631 yasha got 17 all right 004912566 --> 004914239 all right then 15 for beau and jester all right 15 to ten 004924874 --> 004925620 14 for fjord 004927221 --> 004930978 all right ten to five 004932481 --> 004933957 all right 004936959 --> 004938568 caduceus 004940050 --> 004940886 all righty 004943134 --> 004948291 great top of the round first up is yasha 004954078 --> 004959733 everyone's speed is halved underwater 005004979 --> 005006152 except yours 005007021 --> 005012195 her movement speed is 40 right 005029419 --> 005030234 20 feet would get her almost into melee with this one 005036981 --> 005037892 yeah just outside of it 005041336 --> 005050562 all right so rage then she can use her action to dash and move again if she's not 005056021 --> 005057445 attacking with it 005057445 --> 005059515 all right she gets into melee with that figure there you got it that finishes yasha's 005103532 --> 005106350 go beau and jester your turns 005106350 --> 005107855 all right against which one 005113525 --> 005117420 okay go for it roll for an attack 005119138 --> 005121930 sure 005124334 --> 005128479 16 hits go ahead and roll damage on that one 005133904 --> 005135614 slightly norse 005145635 --> 005147173 nice that one next attack on it has advantage 005155489 --> 005156238 as yasha says that jester glances over puts her hand out this sparkling radiant light 005202272 --> 005207655 goes through the water leaving this vacuum trail behind as the bolt slams into the merrow 005207655 --> 005212437 brightening up around its chest with the impact of the magical energy now its form is glittering 005212437 --> 005217754 with that light making it very easy to spot its location do you want to move or stay where you are 005217754 --> 005220610 back up back inside 005223653 --> 005226965 you move inside the chamber there okay 005229840 --> 005233918 you got it that ends your turn beau what are you doing 005240419 --> 005247751 you have 25 feet you can get right up to it i'll shift these guys here a little bit to 005253101 --> 005255194 make a space for it where they were 005255194 --> 005258262 is your speed 50 then 005308580 --> 005310720 oh got you so it would be 20 feet because you round down in d&ampd unless it specially says 005314133 --> 005316744 otherwise so you'd be just out of range 005316744 --> 005319789 all right that'll get you the distance you need there 005321508 --> 005325366 (singing) do it 005326753 --> 005331808 22 hits 005333322 --> 005337372 ten points of damage you have advantage on that attack by the way because of the guiding bolt 005342288 --> 005348618 you do not have advantage on that one only the first one 005356300 --> 005358087 marisha and oh got you 005358849 --> 005401182 12 misses unfortunately the first strike manages to clock it in the face however as you 005405732 --> 005410418 go to swing backward the water resistance in itself-- which actually this is a good point of 005410418 --> 005415464 order remember you're underwater remember this going forward melee attacks and weapon attacks 005415464 --> 005416840 have disadvantage 005416840 --> 005418641 (groaning) 005418641 --> 005428190 a melee weapon attack ranged weapon attacks automatically miss if they're beyond the normal 005435984 --> 005441537 range the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow a net or a weapon that's 005441537 --> 005445827 thrown like a javelin so technically nott your attacks are fine underwater 005445827 --> 005447038 magic attacks are fine but melee weapon attacks have disadvantage 005450356 --> 005453243 you've already used your bonus action to-- 005502122 --> 005505958 no worries after the resistance of the water keeps your blow from coming with too much 005510594 --> 005519304 impact the merrow spins to you as its jaw opens there's the rows of tiny sharp teeth it's creepy 005519304 --> 005524242 when it's right in front of you these are similar but different than the ones you fought 005524242 --> 005529334 before up at the swamp these have longer more sallow features they seem to be a little bit more 005529334 --> 005535504 ocean-based and as such there's a variation to how they look that finishes jester's and beau's 005535504 --> 005537352 turn fjord you're up 005537352 --> 005545175 go for it 005553713 --> 005558035 sam and both hit 005604226 --> 005618193 it gets hit twice in the chest it tries to loop around now you can see the shapes against 005623190 --> 005628420 the little bit of light you can see from the surface above but it's still very dark in the 005628420 --> 005630555 vicinity aside from the globes he has behind 005630555 --> 005636464 oh so you cursed that guy 005638520 --> 005645504 you going to stay in the doorway or move into the chamber 005653964 --> 005655370 all right one step into the room 005658853 --> 005659791 okay so you'd still be there 005701359 --> 005705608 okay so you probably move that way then that ends your go that brings us to their turn 005711026 --> 005711991 this one right there in the front it's going to make-- let's see here 005718112 --> 005720109 one bite with its claw and one with its bite against i'm going to say you since you're the 005726003 --> 005729437 only one who actually managed to connect with it physically as you rush up into its face and slam 005729437 --> 005734678 it once the other attack misses as it curves under it goes (snarling) its jaw opens to try 005734678 --> 005737019 and snap towards your shoulder and neck area 005737019 --> 005738577 no they do not because they both have sentinel we have to remember that 005743124 --> 005744319 yeah if they both have sentinel they can't bounce attacks we kept forgetting that in the past 005748273 --> 005749717 because the combination becomes super broken that's going to be a-- 005757877 --> 005801734 19 to hit 005803100 --> 005804410 all right and then the claw attack ooh that's going to be a 22 to hit you suffer from 005811567 --> 005815830 the bite attack nine points of piercing damage 005815830 --> 005817561 then the claws deal ten points of slashing damage 005824187 --> 005825469 it's going to attempt to move out of the way of each of you because it doesn't know any better 005831851 --> 005837913 it has a swim speed of 40 feet so it's going to attempt to pull back to get some range you each 005837913 --> 005839586 technically get an attack of opportunity on it 005839586 --> 005840841 it's hoping disadvantage on each attack 005842895 --> 005844685 you can't make-- reckless you have to do on your turn i think 005846987 --> 005850144 what was the other 005851839 --> 005859124 14 hits 005903042 --> 005905316 marisha and reckless attack when you make your first attack on your turn so you have to choose it on 005911284 --> 005912051 your turn 005912051 --> 005914200 19 still hits yeah you both can attack and it does not move it tries to pull away and-- 005917961 --> 005920898 there you go see now it pays off 005922185 --> 005924910 it tries to back away hoping that the water itself will help protect it to pull away nuh-uh 005934368 --> 005938810 the two ladies are not going to let it flee whack one hit from beau as yasha through the 005938810 --> 005942571 water carves with the greatsword magician's judge hitting across the chest you can see this 005942571 --> 005949388 deep red cloud form around its chest as it tries to pull away you hold it in place unable to escape 005949388 --> 005951043 there you go 005952507 --> 005955548 this one that's hexed is going to move down towards the deck it'll glance through and it sees 010001776 --> 010014568 caleb it's going to move in a little closer to caleb and as it pulls its harpoon back it throws 010014568 --> 010020818 it forward towards you it's going to attempt to harpoon you caleb that is a 19 to hit 010020818 --> 010022631 (groaning) 010022631 --> 010024885 you take 11 points of piercing damage i'm going to need you to make a strength check 010033895 --> 010035368 it's contested 010039590 --> 010042929 yeah you get pulled out of the interior 010048095 --> 010049327 11 010052642 --> 010054942 nope caleb stands there in the back looking and all of a sudden (impacts) into his 010100530 --> 010105725 chest the thing pierces in the stomach area there and then gets pulled out you try to reach for 010105725 --> 010114968 him but he's already gone and he gets pulled out in the middle of the open area from there comes 010114968 --> 010116577 the shallow priest's turn 010116577 --> 010118401 the shallow priest is going to move down and it's going to move to there it's going to attempt 010143908 --> 010149925 to harpoon caleb out of the other one's grasp as well it's trying to chain pull you away that's 010149925 --> 010152747 going to be a 17 to hit 010152747 --> 010153920 the harpoon ricochets off of the shield and goes limp the creature pulls on the chain as it 010202259 --> 010206664 falls back into its grasp it's currently clutching its staff in the other hand and it's 010206664 --> 010214626 going to pull back for the rest of its movement there out of the vicinity that's going to end 010214626 --> 010216960 their turn now it comes to nott 010216960 --> 010229945 oh gotcha it's a wisdom saving throw 010308533 --> 010311505 the one that currently has caleb that is going to be a 12 success 010318485 --> 010327007 the harpoon that pulled caleb in has been pulled out of the wound and there's a little bit 010336796 --> 010341107 of blood that's now trailing from the initial impact caleb is not currently held or grappled 010341107 --> 010342807 it's just not in his face 010342807 --> 010344367 not at this moment when it pulled him in it pulled it out of his body but it's right in 010347043 --> 010348102 front of him 010348102 --> 010353067 you can't quite get up to him unfortunately because it's 15 feet underwater 010359392 --> 010405136 your speed of 30 is reduced to 15 and it took 15 feet to get far out you could as a bonus 010405136 --> 010408769 action dash to move up to him but you can't pull him back because you don't have an action to try 010408769 --> 010409518 and grab 010409518 --> 010421445 i'll say make a strength check 010424980 --> 010429732 yes 010431064 --> 010436230 you feel this small push on your shoulder and you see nott drift upside down in front of you as 010447403 --> 010457460 the merrow who pulled you in with this terrible toothy grimace and starts going (chuckling) and is 010457460 --> 010505059 bowling over chuckling it's a weird moment that finishes nott's go caleb you're up 010505059 --> 010507240 that one is incapacitated 010508612 --> 010510098 no he's just held in place 010512436 --> 010523973 all righty 010527735 --> 010530144 concentrating both of you guys wisdom saving throw that's a failure on the shallow 010549895 --> 010555726 priest and the one that's over there rolled an 18 so that's incapacitated is fine with the slow 010555726 --> 010557799 however the shallow priest is slowed 010557799 --> 010602200 correct if it tries to cast a spell it takes a full round back before it can even hit 010609752 --> 010620822 you just manage to get back inside of the chamber the doorway's still open all right that 010625719 --> 010628067 finishes your go caduceus you're up 010628067 --> 010629543 nope 010649318 --> 010650681 one has to be cantrip and the other can be any level 010652601 --> 010657911 you have five more of feet in movement there stepping out of the doorway 010706718 --> 010718765 yeah 010731516 --> 010735201 you can move five more feet you might you have to eyeball it and may take the risk 010739568 --> 010746392 (counting) i'll say with the angle 30 he's just within range 010752473 --> 010755480 nope that's a fail one in the middle that's a ten that's a fail over here that's a 010815362 --> 010817953 five that's a fail they all have a minus one on their charisma 010817953 --> 010829620 not bad for a 1st-level spell it doesn't get a lot of love 010831591 --> 010833733 the water around seems to get even darker for a moment and ice crystals begin to form at the 010841518 --> 010846159 edge of their bodies as the chill becomes unnatural and begins sluggishly shift their 010846159 --> 010851819 movements this cleric spell sending itself into their form that finishes your turn 010851819 --> 010853753 finishing that up we can do the top of the round yasha's up first 010856887 --> 010902392 go for it yasha by the way is no longer raging she wasn't attacked or didn't-- oh no but 010911786 --> 010916030 she did get an attack of opportunity so she would be you're correct 010916030 --> 010917645 that hits 010918471 --> 010920330 yeah both hit 010921962 --> 010929272 first blow as she swings by carves through as it goes taut for a second all of its muscle 010936935 --> 010941003 seizing and then goes limp as its torso begins to drift away from the lower half of its fish body 010941003 --> 010943828 and it begins to slowly float off 010943828 --> 010950123 right now you still have the second attack it depends on the movement you have and i don't 010953716 --> 010955923 what else you can get in range for 010955923 --> 010959280 did you roll disadvantage on that attack by the way 011001613 --> 011006612 i would say that gets you right about there you'd be just in range for the one that's incapacitated 011013728 --> 011015549 yeah 011016431 --> 011017808 it's just a-- down it swims down 011020132 --> 011021689 yeah reroll for this one 011023375 --> 011024081 17 hits 011025434 --> 011031246 12 points of slashing damage 011034659 --> 011036924 well this is yasha's turn 011039217 --> 011041308 for your tasha's hideous laughter i believe it gets to make a saving throw when it takes 011044505 --> 011046132 damage is that correct 011046132 --> 011050806 that is a natural 18 011054675 --> 011056650 that's right yes 011057836 --> 011100660 okay the advantage didn't help it 011103534 --> 011107878 ooh minus four brings it to 14 011109382 --> 011110700 so it still resists it 011112610 --> 011114241 it reduced it to 14 but 14 was the dc 011117181 --> 011119297 all right 011127449 --> 011129025 that finishes that go all righty yasha's turn's done beau and jester 011132499 --> 011138189 you don't need to you can get there-- 011139373 --> 011140424 oh i see 011141753 --> 011143244 you would have to step of the wind to get to him 011149162 --> 011151287 okay go ahead and attempt that 011155960 --> 011157506 yeah no that hits 011201733 --> 011203063 (splat noise) 011206598 --> 011209076 12 points of damage to the shallow priest you got it 011215357 --> 011217279 with that you move forward swimming through the water and then step of the wind use 011223130 --> 011227403 another ki point to get up there fists at the ready 011227403 --> 011228888 22 hits 011234161 --> 011239752 nine points of damage on that one 011242262 --> 011245244 well that first one should have been just a regular roll did you roll with advantage 011249298 --> 011250500 just roll once for the first attack for me again real fast 011253135 --> 011258533 there you go for the second attack it's disadvantage 011301019 --> 011305215 17 still hits 011306390 --> 011310567 there you go nine and nine you swim forward rocketing forward aquaman-style and 011316149 --> 011324498 then two big hits to its face the shallow priest takes the impact but its body reacts slowly the 011324498 --> 011330477 spell that's surrounding it is forcing it to move and shift at half the pace it normally would 011330477 --> 011335246 like rack focuses from beau's middle finger to jester's middle finger perfect all right 011344670 --> 011347792 that finishes beau's go fjord you're up 011347792 --> 011353538 oh no you can because you don't have to worry about it 011401620 --> 011406454 correct 011407303 --> 011411155 that hits 011412365 --> 011419527 11 to hit 011421057 --> 011421902 that misses unfortunately as the first one carves through the bloody cloud that's forming 011429043 --> 011433090 from the wounds it's sustaining gets thicker and bigger it's looking pretty hurt 011433090 --> 011433966 that finishes your turn 011435311 --> 011435846 now it's their turn all right the shallow priest who is currently slowed is going to use 011451966 --> 011455869 its action to do its multiattack so that's two attacks on you with its bite and claw it's not 011455869 --> 011457906 going to use any of its spells 011457906 --> 011459853 no that's right it doesn't get multiattack when it's slowed 011502089 --> 011503015 then it's going to harpoon you it's not going to bother with the claw and the bite it's 011506052 --> 011510247 going to pull back with its one harpoon and try and thrust it into your chest 011510247 --> 011511496 yes 011512073 --> 011513192 correct that's two off of it that brings it from 19 to 17 what's your armor class 011519895 --> 011520715 the bane prevents it from hitting you as it goes and thrusts the harpoon forward it 011528401 --> 011534304 telegraphs it just enough that as it leaves you (whoosh) it nicks the very edge of your skin 011534304 --> 011536372 ever so slightly and that's it 011536372 --> 011539814 it's going to attempt to move away 011546531 --> 011548168 go for it roll for an attack 011553302 --> 011554619 yep 011555213 --> 011558669 correct it would have a swim speed of 40 underwater so it can only go 20 it manages to 011608225 --> 011611706 pull out of the range up there and at the end of its turn it gets to-- 011611706 --> 011612774 both of them make a save because they're both-- well that one no that one missed the 011615103 --> 011619990 slow that is a 11 plus three 14 011619990 --> 011621800 minus four ten yeah it's still slowed 011628028 --> 011629486 it's starting to turn around too seeing how things shifted here it saw the light and you 011635713 --> 011640935 can see what little bit of his expression underwater at this point they followed this light 011640935 --> 011647070 to inspect it thought they had an ambush on a creature and suddenly this party emerged now 011647070 --> 011651441 well that one's in a really rough spot this one is looking like it's about to turn and try and flee 011651441 --> 011659625 that's going to end the shallow priest's turn and the other one's turn i haven't done that one yet 011659625 --> 011705008 right that one is going to attempt to use its harpoon against you fjord 011705008 --> 011705741 since you ran up and carved at it or yeah it's going to try that that's a natural 20 011713084 --> 011717658 it's just not a critical hit 011719489 --> 011720664 your ability you're talking about 011722029 --> 011725601 it would still be a critical hit for a natural 20 but it would then be a total of-- it 011737013 --> 011738316 would be a 22 still 011738316 --> 011740016 you use channel divinity once to cancel the critical on that as the harpoon comes towards 011744938 --> 011752889 you there's this slight dull green barrier that seems to slow the penetration of the immediate 011752889 --> 011757659 lightning-fast pace of this harpoon it manages to carve into the front of your armor and pierce 011757659 --> 011801922 through ever so slightly it's not a critical hit unfortunately 011801922 --> 011802726 that's 11 points of piercing damage to you after it carves through and wounds you it pushes 011811708 --> 011815992 through the other way and you manage to roll off it would've been far worse damage if caduceus 011815992 --> 011821978 hadn't helped you in that moment it's going to attempt to move away yasha gets attack of opportunity 011821978 --> 011825160 right because it is now reckless 011827144 --> 011833228 that'll hit 011834373 --> 011836014 no because you were pushing him you weren't moving in that area so you're not quite 011839492 --> 011840553 in melee with him 011840553 --> 011846715 14 points of damage it turns around and darts and yasha just (whoosh) one swipe with her 011850826 --> 011856924 sword she's finishing them off left and right 011856924 --> 011859440 ashley come back 011901338 --> 011904680 marisha and that finishes the merrow's turn it did not go well for them in that brief instance nott 011911855 --> 011913332 you're up 011913332 --> 011915647 yeah your crossbow actually-- 011917530 --> 011919582 they're probably about 40 or so feet from you 011933009 --> 011938219 actually crossbow does not get hit with that problem because they're piercing however 012000310 --> 012004334 what's your inside range it's 30 feet 012004334 --> 012005196 then yeah as long as you're inside range then you're fine you swim up there towards it as 012009563 --> 012014483 you're kicking your feet and cocking the bolt back into it and go to aim just within range you see 012014483 --> 012017902 it as it's turning around to attempt to swim away at full speed 012017902 --> 012019437 that hits 012052685 --> 012054615 11 points of piercing damage to the shallow priest you see another plume of dark ichor 012111412 --> 012115558 pouring out the side of its wound as the bolt is now about three or four inches jutting out of the 012115558 --> 012121516 side of its torso it glances sidelong at you and seems to inspire it to try and move faster that 012121516 --> 012122602 finishes your turn nott 012122602 --> 012124306 not so much on that one unfortunately 012131701 --> 012134062 finishing that go caleb your turn 012136791 --> 012144460 19 damage all right how do you want to do this 012222193 --> 012224164 okay it gets some distance caleb feeling comfortable lets the missiles arc past and up and 012243288 --> 012249841 over as they swirl and gather they all come in at once and this darkened shape suddenly there's a 012249841 --> 012257317 flash of arcane energy and this strange little bubble explosion where it was the impact happens 012257317 --> 012303949 and its arms separate from the impact they hit in the torso blew it apart from the inside there's 012303949 --> 012308392 a little cloud of darkness left behind as it begins to slowly disseminate among the rest of the 012308392 --> 012310230 sea water around 012310230 --> 012312891 here in the shadowed darkness 012346713 --> 012348908 on the two regular merrow that you came across you find that they have their 012359488 --> 012405593 harpoon there are definitely teeth upon their bodies and claws as part of their physical form 012405593 --> 012412500 they're not carrying much on them per se beyond the equipment they have and a handful of collected 012412500 --> 012424626 shiny things a few copper a key that was scrounged up that's old and very rusted looks 012424626 --> 012425619 like maybe a handful of-- 012425619 --> 012426907 all right you have a rusted key 012429165 --> 012432668 the shallow priest since it was destroyed a ways off some of its accoutrements were left to 012451644 --> 012500043 scatter and float below you do manage to find on what pieces you do scrounge up a heavy necklace 012500043 --> 012507471 made of these larger pearls probably worth a little bit of gold on the side that's about it 012507471 --> 012512451 okay 012513598 --> 012515725 all right write that down inspecting where the hands meet with the box no these are a 012522413 --> 012523691 different size-- 012523691 --> 012528470 slightly larger at least it seems-- 012531789 --> 012534200 all right so you have a-- 012613330 --> 012619074 you see these two dark octopus eyes and then this little unshaven grin poking through underneath 012627619 --> 012630977 i'd say you have a few more minutes on it still because you didn't cast any other 012647327 --> 012650274 concentration spells and you didn't take any damage so you're fine 012650274 --> 012655884 you don't know 012716428 --> 012722876 okay if you want to 012728292 --> 012738845 we'll consider that as you guys are traveling you're helming this journey from that 012745176 --> 012747046 direction make a perception check for me please 012747046 --> 012752644 22 that's great as you guys step off of the edge of your ship's wreckage and all slowly 012800865 --> 012807619 sink down to find the floor of the ocean once more and the subtle grade that continues downward as 012807619 --> 012812820 you being to step following jester moving forward you see another shape begin to approach 012812820 --> 012816299 jester you see it first and glance over it's another ship 012816299 --> 012820065 no another ship sunken here you continue on for another 100 or 150 or so feet and you see 012826842 --> 012830005 the shape off to the right of another shipwreck 012830005 --> 012831983 the spell fades but you still know the general direction of where it was coming from up 012849703 --> 012853232 to you if you want to cast it again or continue on based on the memory 012853232 --> 012854446 make a perception check 012859309 --> 012901963 you can certainly try you're moving half-speed because of the water and you're moving 012907062 --> 012913066 at half speed beyond that moving stealthily so it's a very slow journey but you can do it 012913066 --> 012914392 okay are you guys moving stealthily or not 012917878 --> 012919104 marisha and everyone make a stealth check and make a stealth check for yasha as well you guys are 012926306 --> 012929687 moving at quarter speed essentially to move underwater 012929687 --> 012932827 taliesin and the average is slightly in your favor you're on the edge there continuing forward it 012953650 --> 013001394 evens out a bit this gradual caldera-type valley that rests here before you the more you begin to 013001394 --> 013007484 watch now that you're keeping an eye for it there's a number of areas where wreckage can be 013007484 --> 013012515 seen some of it very old the third ship that you pass by heading in the direction that you recall 013012515 --> 013015515 has been down here for decades 013015515 --> 013026346 make a general wisdom check 013057952 --> 013059135 yeah since she's attempting to get in tune with the energy of the atmosphere 013105894 --> 013114402 you concentrate for a moment and the water gets slightly warmer 013121021 --> 013124796 you decide to maybe not walk directly behind jester 013131892 --> 013133867 with the little bit of travel you're doing-- they're sparse but there are a number of ships in 013143057 --> 013147135 this large area that seem to have sunken at different times throughout the years 013147135 --> 013148797 no source of light no jester however who's been at the front keeping a close eye-- a 013153432 --> 013159192 little ways in as you're peering out and clocking in each of these shipwrecks as they come across 013159192 --> 013204406 you see this little faint blip of light 013204406 --> 013207088 you see it once or twice again it's a little momentary shine 013214624 --> 013218360 at this point of travel it's about 350 400 feet ahead of you 013232668 --> 013235484 the general direction 013237267 --> 013239786 all right if i could get a marching order please 013354500 --> 013401728 who's together and what 013406841 --> 013408302 what a nice book end you all begin to slowly move forward keeping your eyes peeled for 013437212 --> 013444250 any sort of movement with no light it is extremely dark here with that faint little bit of 013444250 --> 013446853 shimmering dull green from above 013446853 --> 013453593 there you go as you guys continue to move in that direction some of you begin to see this 013502264 --> 013512775 light as well caduceus first then you caleb and beau you see it looks like-- imagine if beams 013512775 --> 013527370 of sunlight managed to roll across a piece of polished metal a little shining shifting sight 013527370 --> 013529995 are you guys staying put or are you continuing to move forward slowly 013633461 --> 013636350 you all sit tight for a second halting your position you watch as the octopus makes its way 013644224 --> 013650046 into the shadow ahead caleb you're focusing and it takes a while but frumpkin eventually 013650046 --> 013701543 following this tiny shifting bead of golden light into view you begin to see towards the center of 013701543 --> 013711213 where this large valley is there is a large cluster of long dead pale-white coral that 013711213 --> 013714152 surrounds a rocky stone shelf 013714152 --> 013715820 make a perception check for frumpkin 013720121 --> 013720810 okay you see this coral space around it's massive it's maybe 250 300 feet across and it's 013733100 --> 013740658 this dead chunk of coral reef in this vicinity that amassed around this central stone that rises 013740658 --> 013746243 up there's a small crevasse on the side of it that goes down about 30 or so feet and you can see 013746243 --> 013748174 fish weaving through 013748174 --> 013752572 yeah but it's occasional 013753905 --> 013758044 yeah and maybe every now and then reorient the direction that frumpkin was traveling as you 013804945 --> 013809141 come to see this space does frumpkin continue to get closer 013809141 --> 013811497 okay frumpkin moves around and it takes a while because frumpkin isn't very good at 013818460 --> 013819716 perceiving right now 013819716 --> 013821291 you guys are getting a little impatient here hearing-- 013825805 --> 013828816 yeah 013829747 --> 013831756 if you want to 013832945 --> 013833639 you all continue to move forward 013841370 --> 013842704 frumpkin is going around and checking and finds that towards the front of this coral reef 013856165 --> 013902750 area where this rock shelf is there appears to be an open cavern entrance right underneath this 013902750 --> 013908750 shelf as frumpkin ducks down and looks you can see another one of the shine there's a few of them 013908750 --> 013910840 frumpkin quickly retracts and finds his way to the rest of you 013923389 --> 013926159 yep 014118088 --> 014123120 as you're moving through this area there are clumps of seaweed that rise up hundreds of 014133527 --> 014138493 feet out of view the base of it is pretty thick and you could try and move through that that's 014138493 --> 014143326 what you are using to stealth as you come through darting from section to section of this heavy 014143326 --> 014144943 underwater vegetation 014144943 --> 014149583 sure 014151844 --> 014153113 that's going to itch like a motherfucker in the morning 014159711 --> 014204543 you slowly farm sections of seaweed and begin to shift your way forward using it as a 014209844 --> 014218362 screen the shifting tendrils slowly shimmy along in the direction of this coral cluster 014218362 --> 014219793 there you go 014221204 --> 014225373 who's at the front of this journey maintaining a similar position 014238577 --> 014239808 okay perception check and one other person if they wish to 014242413 --> 014243618 both of you guys roll perception 014253023 --> 014254443 laura and okay 014255382 --> 014256463 as you both come up to the edge of where the sandbank here seems to slightly descend in a 014302660 --> 014308787 series of soft steps before that small ravine carves down and that large chunk of rock stands 014308787 --> 014314649 there you can see the cavern you see once again that shifting it's like a wave of light passes 014314649 --> 014321913 over you can see it's coins a bunch of light passes over coins that are scattered amongst the 014321913 --> 014324065 floor of the entrance of this tunnel 014324065 --> 014326471 not from this distance 014330428 --> 014331329 you saw at the entrance a handful of coins that caught the light yeah 014341159 --> 014342679 you're maybe about since you stopped at that edge before it begins to descend over you're 014547533 --> 014549356 about 60 or so feet from this 014549356 --> 014555163 yeah ahead and facing towards you guys with a large shelf that protrudes over it that puts it 014559576 --> 014604982 mostly in shadow and the coral's built all around that if you wanted to try and move around it you 014604982 --> 014608252 could but it's about 200 or so feet across 014608252 --> 014613860 you guys swim across towards the top all right you paddle up as a group up-- 014630846 --> 014632434 travis and oh around 014633462 --> 014634559 you guys move slowly around still moving stealthily to the edges then you move up and 014639984 --> 014641651 over what are you doing 014641651 --> 014642205 okay 014643305 --> 014645027 you get up and slowly descend towards where the coral is your feet find the edges some of it 014650242 --> 014655354 is brittle and as your foot touches it snaps and parts of it crumble at the very edges but nothing 014655354 --> 014700210 that you feel will alert your presence necessarily 014700210 --> 014702617 as you move up to the edge of the shelf and you glance over the edge you see the shadow 014712830 --> 014723247 entrance of the cavern before you once again that shimmer finds its way across a dozen or more coins 014723247 --> 014730684 that are visible partially embedded in the muck and sand there at the foot of this cavern entrance 014730726 --> 014734300 it's bits of coral when you step out towards that shelf the coral recedes and now it's 014746883 --> 014750866 a protruding large slab of stone 014750866 --> 014755561 make a perception check 014757699 --> 014758989 it looks to be stone 014818369 --> 014826755 okay so you use channel divinity once and you send your duplicate to swim down-- 014837493 --> 014841823 okay you watch as the illusory jester goes and performs a great stock video of excited lucky 014857650 --> 014901943 person performing the reaction silently 014901943 --> 014905507 have you ever-- 014906978 --> 014907810 don't you hate it when-- 014911154 --> 014915368 30 seconds pass of jester doing the song and dance down there no reaction 014921449 --> 014924779 okay fjord dives off the side and swims down towards the entrance to this cavern as you 014932998 --> 014937523 approach you can see the coins plainly in front of you do you land at the entrance 014937523 --> 014938441 okay your feet find soft footfall on the sediment that has gathered there knocking up a 014945558 --> 014948960 little bit of it for a minute before it all eventually settles once more looking inside make 014948960 --> 014950661 a perception check 014950661 --> 014953547 okay 014954410 --> 014956917 you glance inside there's no source of the light that you keep seeing flashing by you look 015004568 --> 015010196 down and there's no glittering anymore there's no traveling light beam but the coins are there in 015010196 --> 015015195 front of you looking up into the cavern it continues in and seems to descend and open up into 015015195 --> 015019342 a chamber just where your darkvision ends 015019342 --> 015020402 the inside is filled with seaweed as well it seems to be running up the walls of the 015028394 --> 015034455 interior as well as a section of it sitting in the center of the main chamber it's a different 015034455 --> 015037005 color than the seaweed that you've been using to get here 015037005 --> 015041551 with a slight displacement and popping sound of the water making room for the falchion as it 015119979 --> 015125456 emerges it hums slightly in your grasp being this deep in the ocean 015125456 --> 015130260 no but it is casting it and it is very present there is a faint hint of eagerness 015139081 --> 015140703 brimming from within you 015140703 --> 015145269 okay so you stay up above all of you make your way towards the entrance to this cavern 015157460 --> 015201324 all

off you all were beginning to make your way into this series 021352370 --> 021356808 of-- there's this whole strange entrance to this cavern 021356808 --> 021359030 as you step in the inside it descends a bit like makeshift natural paths like stairs or 021412558 --> 021418294 grades that curve around and drop into the central chamber where you see it goes in two different 021418294 --> 021426287 directions to the right and left in the middle there's a large cluster of this purplish-maroon 021426287 --> 021433550 seaweed the outside of the leaves have a teal-ish blue color it wraps up against the walls 021433550 --> 021440371 as well as you swim through and move the still water shifts with your movement you can see some 021440371 --> 021442687 of it sway and move with your movement 021442687 --> 021447213 looking down make an investigation check 021451580 --> 021453693 apparently well if there was a week to use it 021503794 --> 021504803 you sift your hand through underneath and feel you find an errant copper piece left there 021510861 --> 021519102 that comes up into your fingers the rest of it appears to be general sand and soft silt that 021519102 --> 021524385 clouds a bit around your fingers as you pull your hand up from mucking around in it it settles 021524385 --> 021525538 fairly quickly 021525538 --> 021529777 right about now she vanishes 021535777 --> 021536603 yes 021540145 --> 021547755 it's certainly possible 021552524 --> 021558413 okay nothing ahead of you seems to give a magical aura behind you ever so faintly 021622799 --> 021627245 it's coming from the mouth of the cave towards the top 021629913 --> 021632714 nothing in the room-- and you do know glancing at that magical aura coming from the 021646594 --> 021650858 entranceway it is illusory in nature 021650858 --> 021659326 correct 021700260 --> 021703539 nope 021704666 --> 021708162 old buttonbeard's legend lives on as buttonbeard trounces around the central chamber 021753030 --> 021756497 no reaction 021756497 --> 021808079 you express your interests to the kelp well seaweed technically kelp is a little more 021818626 --> 021820119 shallow-based yeah 021820119 --> 021822125 you're all still standing in the entranceway as you come down into this central chamber it's 021844254 --> 021848634 about 35 40 feet from side to side and then it branches off to the right and left ahead of you-- 021848634 --> 021850830 there is that central cluster of seaweed that is coming up and going against the ceiling 021854084 --> 021857451 and you can see on the walls it's still riding along the edges 021857451 --> 021859741 you move towards the fork the chamber itself is oval-like but in the center of the 021928962 --> 021934817 chamber is where there's a mass of the seaweed so you'd have to curve around it to get to either exit 021934849 --> 021939077 there are some wayward stones that you could probably-- 021943325 --> 021946729 no all the seaweed in this chamber is a different color than what you've seen when you 021950053 --> 021955291 came in everything else had a greenish-blue tint to it this has a deep maroon-purple with a blue 021955291 --> 021959856 outline across the exterior of each little thread of leaf 021959856 --> 022005167 yeah they were mango-esque 022011526 --> 022013060 it hits it moves with the impact with the faint bit that gets hit there's no reaction 022032494 --> 022037714 make a perception check 022124479 --> 022135316 oh just you okay 022138097 --> 022143947 no bubbles there's no aeration of the interior here 022148090 --> 022151328 glancing up yeah you can see where the seaweed gathers and bunches up towards meeting it 022155770 --> 022202097 from the walls in the center of the chamber it's maybe 15 feet above you it's not terribly tall 022202097 --> 022204752 you can see the two sides yeah 022216210 --> 022222538 it looks like it's a cavern 022228438 --> 022231944 okay it goes a few inches into the soft floor of the chamber before it hits stone 022256254 --> 022259402 okay you take your first step and you watch something drift across the entrance from wall to 022312328 --> 022318170 wall some faint glowing figure-- and is gone 022318170 --> 022320124 not magic sense no 022328813 --> 022332760 okay give me the specifications on that one 022341502 --> 022348334 okay got you how long does it last 022357385 --> 022400658 okay we'll say for the purposes of this this is a reaction to seeing this figure pass by 022409557 --> 022416929 you definitely get an undead sense from whatever this figure is and then it merges with the wall 022416929 --> 022422099 and is gone it appeared to be loosely humanoid in the brief glimpse you saw 022422099 --> 022424236 okay in the center of the kelp forest that sits in the center of the chamber a source of 022505474 --> 022512565 light begins to emanate like a lantern covered in soft diffusing material the beams protrude and 022512565 --> 022519065 lighten up the chamber like a lantern as it goes through you have a better view of the interior 022519065 --> 022531469 you notice that the kelp forest is cluttered with strips of cloth bones two or three merrow 022531469 --> 022538608 corpses that have long decomposed and look tangled and wrapped and are held towards the ceiling 022538608 --> 022547496 there are a handful of what might have been human remains tangled in that same seaweed 022547496 --> 022550547 the light vanishes once more and darkness comes to the chamber 022638098 --> 022642065 do you guys continue to the right chamber 022644228 --> 022644776 understood fjord you just have this gentle chill on the back of your head like something 022706544 --> 022711501 frozen just caressed the back of your skull and is gone 022711501 --> 022714257 you continue forward through this tunnel around the seaweed cluster in the center moving 022749485 --> 022755793 through in the same order that you situated there there's just enough room maybe ten feet across 022755793 --> 022804058 to stay comfortably you'd want to single-file it as you walk through the edges of the seaweed 022804058 --> 022809136 begin to drift forward seemingly drawn in by the warmth of your bodies 022809136 --> 022810290 it's pulling in there's the central section and the wall as you begin to move through it 022820328 --> 022823407 begins to slowly pull in to close in towards you 022823407 --> 022827352 moving quickly through it's not moving rapidly as soon as you see this you begin to 022835658 --> 022839220 dart through the only person who would be in danger is the very end caleb since you're at the 022839220 --> 022843189 back i need you to make a dexterity saving throw for me because as all of you start darting 022843189 --> 022847602 through and making your way they're drifting and tangling in closer together 022847602 --> 022852129 okay as you move forward you feel a bit of it touch your shoulder and then it wraps around 022900804 --> 022906133 and pulls you against the wall you guys hear this (slamming) behind there's a shift of water you 022906133 --> 022911669 watch caleb get yanked towards the right side of the chamber it's currently (sucking) the seaweed 022911669 --> 022919650 begins to snake its way around caleb you take five points of poison damage and are grappled 022919650 --> 022921143 sure i'll say two attacks with disadvantage because you're having to aim them to try to keep 022931619 --> 022932374 around him 022932374 --> 022934121 okay the light fills the space 022936903 --> 022941056 okay yeah both hit go ahead and roll damage 022943356 --> 022945403 okay each side-- both blasts of eldritch blast impact the sides of the cavern wall with a 022958057 --> 023005210 dull (thud) the clusters of seaweed that currently wrap around caleb are torn to the point 023005210 --> 023009481 where you have enough strength to pull yourself free breaking the grapple you shrug them off of 023009481 --> 023014247 you as you're touching with your fingers your fingers spike with pain no additional poison 023014247 --> 023017419 damage necessarily but you know staying would continue to do so 023017419 --> 023018678 you are not poisoned you just took poison damage you manage to pull it away and catch up 023022445 --> 023026468 with the rest of the crew you guys are heading towards the right chamber which begins to rise up 023026468 --> 023032109 a bit before leveling off about 15 feet above and about 20 feet ahead of you the walls are still 023032109 --> 023038098 covered in this seaweed in chunks about every five or so feet you see another cluster and 023038098 --> 023044916 they're a bit scattered around the interior a large portion of this whole chamber network seems 023044916 --> 023048206 to be housing this same type of plant 023048206 --> 023053006 make a perception check 023057197 --> 023058833 okay so you're readying the spell 023106538 --> 023108220 yeah so you're fine 023109782 --> 023111143 okay jester you feel this-- like a burst of brain freeze for a second-- like something cold 023130983 --> 023133838 tickles the inside of your head and it's gone 023133838 --> 023136764 caduceus you see something shadowy shift long down the hall up and above that barely catches 023152456 --> 023154371 your attention before it's gone 023154371 --> 023157513 you don't it's not the same as before 023200401 --> 023202374 from what you saw before it was giving a faint pale glow and had a ghostly presence to it 023208378 --> 023210707 this is just a movement in dark shadow 023210707 --> 023218887 yeah she has an ability 023241317 --> 023242897 yeah so yasha holds onto that then 023310867 --> 023311970 all right so continuing on 023319847 --> 023323693 all right go ahead and make a perception check to see if you notice anything strange about 023330988 --> 023332591 the interior 023332591 --> 023335418 okay looking about the area it looks like a natural cavern you don't see much that would 023342619 --> 023348327 catch-- any some sort of dissembled or trap mechanism with a trigger 023348327 --> 023350260 okay the globules appear like lights coming on segmented down a long hallway as the final one 023416700 --> 023424368 glows right behind it you see the figure of a man looking at you white and pale who then steps 023424368 --> 023426304 back into the wall and vanishes 023426304 --> 023429044 no because you're the closest up there since you're helming it in with darkvision-- 023530288 --> 023536477 darkvision wouldn't matter so much in this instance but the figure you saw looked to be male 023536477 --> 023548362 wearing loose fitting clothing sunken eyes with no actual eyes inside the sockets pale with a 023548362 --> 023559175 faint ghostly glow about their visage a line of rope wrapped around one arm multiple loops it 023559175 --> 023601715 just stared at you before stepping back into the wall and vanishing 023601715 --> 023603395 no expression just blank and cold absent of any real emotion before it dissipated 023635293 --> 023637324 continuing down this path you climb or swim up the brief 15-foot incline to get to the next 023645761 --> 023652693 tunnel path where the orbs were spread out to continue you move through and the elements of 023652693 --> 023658120 seaweed that were still in there are shifting from the water displacement ever so slightly as you 023658120 --> 023701453 move through same order you guys are going through 023701453 --> 023702545 all right that being the case as you push through i need caleb once again to make a 023708766 --> 023709924 dexterity saving throw 023709924 --> 023712859 okay go for it i'll let you do that 023715912 --> 023716554 all right you cast expeditious retreat you manage to dart forward and out of the grasping 023721701 --> 023729249 hands of the seaweed through the use of your spell you catch up now darting forward through 023729249 --> 023731962 everybody next to jester and fjord 023731962 --> 023734393 okay there we are moving forward in that 023744122 --> 023750944 okay following the tunnel down for another 15 to 20 or so feet it curves around to the left 023804593 --> 023808400 do you continue and curve around the edge 023808400 --> 023810133 you come around the corner and look you guys are at the front i need jester and fjord to 023815346 --> 023819505 make-- since you have the globes you can move the globes ahead if you want to 023819505 --> 023825637 so you do not have disadvantage on your perception checks 023828388 --> 023829322 well you're further back we'll get to you because they're the ones at the front they get to 023837747 --> 023838861 do this first 023838861 --> 023840095 but you're safer in the middle what did you get 023843985 --> 023844798 as you turn around the corner and look the path continues for another 20 or so feet in this 023850362 --> 023857124 tunnel before it descends into a much larger chamber the seaweed gets thicker towards the 023857124 --> 023907829 mouth of this chamber from the little bit of glowing orbs that begin to extend over that edge 023907829 --> 023915556 that goes into it what little bit of light hits bits of gold coins scattered all throughout the 023915556 --> 023917230 floor of that next chamber 023917230 --> 023918635 yes they are but that center cluster seemed to have quite a few that were in there 023931291 --> 023940151 these in the walls only have a few scattered pieces of parts no full bodies here in the hallway 023940151 --> 023941892 beau as you're coming around that corner and people are looking off to the side you glance 023950807 --> 023959661 over your shoulder and see for a split second an older man with a curled and scraggly beard that 023959661 --> 024005533 goes down to about mid-chest the eyes are missing you see vacant dark sockets the jaw is 024005533 --> 024010938 slack-jawed and open as it looks towards you i need you to make a charisma saving throw please 024010938 --> 024021260 it leans in towards you and-- not yet it leans in towards you and you feel this cold 024030820 --> 024037132 sensation over your whole body your muscles lock in place and your consciousness goes dark out of 024037132 --> 024043085 the corner of your eye you see some sort of ghostly movement you look over and see beau rest 024043085 --> 024045400 into a standing position on her back foot 024045400 --> 024052254 what's the dc on that 024056222 --> 024101572 eyes are open yeah 024107103 --> 024116174 whatever your spell dc is 024124709 --> 024126696 16 no fails by one it's a 14 plus one 15 024133739 --> 024135375 being a specialist in undead and already preparing for the presence here you glance out of 024142037 --> 024148429 the corner of your eye just in time to see the essence of this spiritual form drift into beau's 024148429 --> 024157124 body as you watch that moment of consciousness fade from her face as the presence of beau goes 024157124 --> 024203503 cold and whatever was in this tunnel begins to come to the forefront you take your staff and 024203503 --> 024211256 slam it into the ground this wave of light energy emerges it impacts all of you and the water gets 024211256 --> 024216069 suddenly warm around you as it blows past beau you see strands of hair get blown back and with 024216069 --> 024224284 that that same ghostly old man body jettisons out the back of her and drags down the hallway into 024224284 --> 024226093 darkness and disappears 024226093 --> 024227901 you have an essence after what just happened that something weird happened and you lost yourself 024312628 --> 024317073 as you guys are having this conversation you glance back in the tunnel where you came from 024350641 --> 024357181 where caduceus had jettisoned that spirit back and at the very edge of the light you can see 024357181 --> 024403509 about 12 or so of these ghostly figures standing there unmoving-- 024403509 --> 024409597 all right pushing towards and following the orbs gliding forward the mouth of this 024425301 --> 024429765 entranceway before it opens up is where it looks like two larger clusters on each side of this 024429765 --> 024431982 seaweed is through you are what 024431982 --> 024436030 they auto-fail saving throws they're seaweed 024441500 --> 024446929 (laughter) 024446929 --> 024450514 roll damage we'll see if it's enough to clear the way for a moment you as well caduceus 024500253 --> 024501761 okay the side on caduceus' edge of the wall you watch this blast of radiant energy 024519942 --> 024525842 emanate from the side of the wall and blow out the center part some of the seaweed get released and 024525842 --> 024530155 begins to scatter and float towards the top your side blasts but it doesn't quite tear all the way 024530155 --> 024537994 through you guys begin darting forward on the right side caleb you're the first one there 024537994 --> 024539993 no you're still expeditious retreat 024541574 --> 024543803 all right you dart inside the chamber ahead of everybody else you're now in the center of 024548856 --> 024553264 this open chamber as you stop with the globes around you to take in the atmosphere the rest of 024553264 --> 024559013 you are now having to catch up yasha needs to make a dexterity saving throw as well 024559013 --> 024559790 she gets advantage because she can see it because of her danger sense 024603043 --> 024605015 she just-- actually no she shoulder checks the seaweed and does not give a shit 024611619 --> 024613646 you guys all begin to push forward this chamber is larger than what you came in through 024623180 --> 024631395 it's about 50 to 60-foot diameter continues in for about 80 or so feet and the height goes to 024631395 --> 024641249 about 30 to 35 feet all the walls here are covered in this seaweed make a perception check 024641249 --> 024644219 two of you who are helming the view on this 024644219 --> 024645748 that's true yeah you make one first 024647472 --> 024651259 okay glancing around you can see areas where the seaweed is slowly shifting from the 024656919 --> 024701794 movement of caleb's expeditious retreat what was once still shifts and you can see elements of the 024701794 --> 024713384 stone wall behind it your eyes barely make out a handful of small carvings in the wall small runic 024713384 --> 024721158 letters that are not in line but at angle sporadically carved at places but where the 024721158 --> 024722848 seaweed moves over and blocks it 024722848 --> 024727802 yeah i'd say you're pushing the edge on this one 024733591 --> 024735741 i'd say as you step into this chamber-- are you heading to the center of it 024743101 --> 024745840 as you're standing at the mouth of this just past the edge you do not detect anything 024749877 --> 024754809 particularly magical then as you take your first step into the chamber you see this you almost 024754809 --> 024804190 run into it in the middle of this chamber there is a small two-foot pedestal and a disc a stone 024804190 --> 024811735 disc about that wide and about two feet from edge to edge that is resting on it but at an angle it 024811735 --> 024822052 looks old it looks weathered and there appears to be a spiral of runes two sets of them that curve 024822052 --> 024827487 inward around each other before merging in the center with one singular sigil where they meet 024827487 --> 024834107 they are arcane glyphs if you'd like to make an arcana check if you want to take a moment 024837396 --> 024838054 to study 024838054 --> 024847166 these runes this whole incantation this enchantment or whatever that sits in this is old 024917136 --> 024925229 pre-calamity age of arcana-level magic it is dormant currently it looks like there is 024925229 --> 024936593 something that is required to infuse this object with power or to get it to use whatever its 024936593 --> 024947573 enchantment is the more you look over it you realize the power's beyond anything you've cast 024947573 --> 024959984 the nature of it seems to be conjuration and it seems to have a lot of the base runes that you've 024959984 --> 025012995 used to manipulate fire you've used to manipulate earth it's elemental in nature you continue to 025012995 --> 025020657 look over it and get the sense that this is triggered by some sort of-- there's a physical 025020657 --> 025027192 material that needs to be brought to this table or brought as part of this ritual and in doing so 025027192 --> 025030789 would conjure some sort of powerful elemental force 025030789 --> 025039307 no you did not 025040618 --> 025041711 you do feel this faint cold brushing sensation at the back of your skull 025046973 --> 025049242 okay you cast locate object focusing on 025105420 --> 025107235 you step forward and can see in the far back side of the chamber as you guys get a look 025111465 --> 025118224 around clustered in with the base of the walls where the seaweed is thick you begin to see as 025118224 --> 025125338 the light around the chamber comes to touch it and you see it first there are piles of salvaged 025125338 --> 025135364 goods gold and silver dishware clusters of coins gold platinum copper silver all in 025135364 --> 025142017 various levels of grime that have gathered on them but the shine still shows through in places 025142017 --> 025151615 you can see tools that were haphazardly pulled and gathered and jammed into pockets in the walls 025151615 --> 025200751 it's like a nightmarish ariel's grotto almost you immediately realize that this is all things 025200751 --> 025206722 that have been salvaged and pulled from all the ships that have sunk and brought in the floor 025206722 --> 025211752 you've been stepping on that's been somewhat soft to the occasional crunch you glance down and 025211752 --> 025227360 realize is just bones just hundreds of human and humanoid bones that have all been gently dusted 025227360 --> 025230871 with the general sand and silt of the interior of this chamber 025230871 --> 025235117 there is a throne a chair of some kind that sits on the opposite side of the room that's at a 025242637 --> 025249034 slight angle resting against the stone and you immediately know that's precisely where the object 025249034 --> 025252173 you seek resides somewhere around or with that 025252173 --> 025254190 you guys are standing towards the entrance like the stairs and the decline that leads inside 025306981 --> 025315219 caleb's the only one that's actually in the center of the chamber by this table this thing that 025315219 --> 025316886 you've been studying 025316886 --> 025319671 you glance over your shoulder 025321377 --> 025321974 about 15 feet behind you 025323022 --> 025325334 (yelling and groaning) 025325334 --> 025327312 as you're getting closer because the arcana is not an immediate thing it's a slow process of 025350378 --> 025358565 study there's a heavy elemental conjuring that this is capable of doing it's very old primal 025358565 --> 025408413 magic looking at the stone the stains and the interior of these ruins there is distinctly a 025408413 --> 025414576 dark brown tint to elements of this table 025414576 --> 025418441 as you scrape some of it with your fingernail it flakes off it has a consistency 025430470 --> 025435891 you're familiar with that of a coagulated blood 025435891 --> 025437661 caduceus as you're looking over towards the throne you look up and about ten feet above the 025451253 --> 025459495 throne standing up in the seaweed holding onto the clusters of it you see a female humanoid form 025459495 --> 025507316 mostly in shadow hair down over the front of the face one yellow eye peeking through on this side 025507316 --> 025512889 and one half-open yellow eye glancing through up against the wall 025512889 --> 025515418 you watch as she scrambles across the side of the wall behind the seaweed and is gone 025530200 --> 025531080 let's roll initiative 025535442 --> 025537648 (yelling) 025537648 --> 025539510 this is the chamber you're in right now this is the entrance 025615059 --> 025616952 yeah you did 025618797 --> 025621141 so caleb you are up against here the rest of you are just coming down the entrance this way 025631856 --> 025634478 tell me whereabouts you were placed around the base 025634478 --> 025636252 that's true i'll put you and caduceus kind of up towards the top there you guys are back here 025653205 --> 025655885 yeah so you'll be up here with the rest of them the shape you saw up in this direction 025701358 --> 025703344 before it vanished 025703344 --> 025705944 dashilla rolled really good initiative so who's up first 25 to 20 025724253 --> 025725008 all right 20 to 15 025742604 --> 025744714 fjord at a 16 15 to ten 025749006 --> 025750138 nott ten to five 025755063 --> 025757585 caleb 025800994 --> 025801821 all righty 025803698 --> 025808158 no i'd say it took you two or three minutes to study so expeditious is still on the table 025813029 --> 025817282 beginning of this round the only person that's seen this entity is caduceus 025822733 --> 025825103 no they seem to have shifted into this thick forest of seaweed that tends to wrap around 025832706 --> 025841502 all the walls of this chamber beau you're up first 025841502 --> 025846211 you can use your action to try and perceive if you want to 025849897 --> 025854473 okay so you use the search action roll a perception check 025857549 --> 025901176 eight unfortunately no you look around the vicinity and glancing up around and you see 025905766 --> 025910833 movement from the water that's being disturbed but no sight of any particular entity 025910833 --> 025918703 okay bonus action to patient defense 025926574 --> 025927695 okay that finishes beau's turn caduceus and jester you guys can decide which of you goes first 025934647 --> 025937047 is bless concentration 025944896 --> 025951313 all right so you guys get to add a d4 to your attack rolls and saving throws 025955260 --> 025959086 right here 030015707 --> 030018562 okay so

030131703 finishes jester's turn there 030131703 --> 030133162 that brings us to-- what did you guys both roll initiative on 030136709 --> 030137963 laura and okay so concurrent with your turn lair action 030141430 --> 030143314 at this point-- 030147043 --> 030149584 you're in the lair of dashilla for this lair action it's going to use lament of the dead 030155696 --> 030204986 as you all stand here rising out of the ground dozens of spirits begin to drift up of various 030204986 --> 030212912 drowned sailors and scavengers out of the ground and up toward the ceiling i need everybody inside 030212912 --> 030215024 to make a wisdom saving throw please 030215024 --> 030218023 fjord you're fine yasha is frightened of dashilla until the end of the round caleb 030252157 --> 030253211 you succeed you manage to resist the fear effect 030301235 --> 030302757 oh nott 030304779 --> 030306977 that's right because you're drunk 030309253 --> 030313789 (yelling) 030313789 --> 030315389 nott becomes nott the brave when she's drunk 030323521 --> 030325238 so unaffected spirits whatever 030328605 --> 030330094 you've been braving the ocean for half a day 030332237 --> 030334901 you manage to resist it 030337478 --> 030342129 as the spirits rise this haunting wailing sound reverberates in the chamber both caleb and 030352065 --> 030359068 yasha their eyes go wide and their breathing begins to increase you guys are frightened of 030359068 --> 030402519 dashilla to the end of the turn now it comes to dashilla's turn 030402519 --> 030403957 suddenly tearing through the seaweed on the upper wall you see this figure emerge now this 030411307 --> 030422961 pale aqua-green skin that's bulbous and strangely proportioned these long clawed hands as the 030422961 --> 030430383 hair pulls back you can see where would be a humanoid face instead are these protracted almost 030430383 --> 030439191 anglerfish-type teeth that come out of the front with no nose and the yellow eyes gleaming from 030439191 --> 030442288 underneath she's going to look straight down at you caleb 030442288 --> 030443560 i need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me please 030446299 --> 030447674 natural one as she looks she's still up in the air swimming looking at you mouth opens 030501953 --> 030510314 and you feel the deepest most horrifying fear well up inside you your heart stops and you drop 030510314 --> 030511509 to zero hit points 030511509 --> 030513842 you guys watch caleb go (creaking) and start drifting there unconscious 030519663 --> 030521813 dashilla now hovering in the space is going to move over she moves over to the side of 030533134 --> 030540593 the wall here still visible now jumping and using and holding onto the seaweed like it's a 030540593 --> 030546002 tether all right 030546002 --> 030547757 the periapt that ends her turn fjord you're up 030553273 --> 030555844 she's visible she's up on the wall on this side 030558529 --> 030600763 remember you guys are still underwater aside from fjord you're all half speed 030604430 --> 030607673 yeah 030612666 --> 030615048 the sword does give a faint bit of light 030616991 --> 030618471 right there 030629261 --> 030642597 she is hexed you have already used your-- 030645814 --> 030648247 as she's holding up there looking down at you the murkiness of the nearby waters in the 030656239 --> 030700935 movement begins to form around her and almost try and claw at her throat like the shadows 030700935 --> 030703885 themselves are trying to pull at her clavicle 030703885 --> 030709818 roll two attacks 030710739 --> 030712326 yeah it is 030718434 --> 030722229 both hit you don't even need the d4s on that roll damage on the critical first 030727209 --> 030734245 so two but roll the d6 which is also doubled 030737890 --> 030739702 so 12 so that's 14 plus your-- 030741871 --> 030743323 that's 18 points of damage on that one and damage for the second one 030749025 --> 030757673 well look at that 36 points of damage on a cantrip and a hex that's how warlocks are done 030805048 --> 030813328 so as she's up there as the hex constrains around her both eldritch blasts hit from both blasts 030813328 --> 030818447 there's these dark scar marks on the upper torso and one off the shoulder where they impact the 030818447 --> 030824566 head curls up and (creaking) back in your direction the eyes seem to bulge angrily toward you 030824566 --> 030825743 does that end your turn 030827132 --> 030830156 okay at the end of your turn she's going to use one of her legendary actions to use forced 030839142 --> 030846099 vision at some point during this adventure as she was trailing you throughout the cavern and 030846318 --> 030850649 watching from a distance she ensorceled a number of your members of the party you being one of them 030850649 --> 030851793 she was hiding through all the seaweed and no one was rolling high enough perception to see 030901053 --> 030905081 her you saw her move once because she didn't roll high enough stealth on that one 030905081 --> 030907287 correct you are not immediately in melee with anybody but she's going to force you to 030914554 --> 030919473 move you glance all of a sudden you see her out of the corner of your eye she's not there 030919473 --> 030924568 anymore she's off there you rush in her direction after her compelled to move over this 030924568 --> 030928626 side right up against the wall between the wall and beau you get there and she's gone you look 030928626 --> 030933559 back and she never left you shake your head for a second that's one legendary action done next 030933559 --> 030935325 turn is nott 030935325 --> 030943811 okay you move over there so bonus action hide 030947451 --> 030951594 16 hits 030952760 --> 030955412 sorry that's right yeah 030957060 --> 030959769 you don't know you'll find out 031001256 --> 031003015 all right so you dart from behind and fire 031005040 --> 031009243 that indeed hits and she didn't roll very well for perception so you do get sneak attack on this 031016136 --> 031018682 33 031030846 --> 031032084 so darting from the side and letting the bubbles go by she is within 30 feet of you so 031037583 --> 031045883 you do not have the disadvantage it catches her in the chest and her hands go forward and she 031045883 --> 031054483 leans out of the seaweed for a second to pull it out and let it fall as it slowly begins to drift 031054483 --> 031059543 down sinking into the chamber before reaching back up into the seaweed and holding on to it 031059543 --> 031101103 no she is immune to the effect of the seaweed 031105708 --> 031108639 so is that your turn 031114160 --> 031115654 all righty finishing nott's go yasha's up yasha is frightened 031118802 --> 031123186 she can do that 031125860 --> 031127935 nah i think that's a thing that berserkers got 031134148 --> 031135239 i'll double check 031136538 --> 031138527 yeah that's mindless rage it's sixth level path of the berserker it's a little grog bleeding 031141505 --> 031142328 in there 031142328 --> 031143839 all good 031144723 --> 031152233 caleb is over there 031154817 --> 031156508 jester's right here she's technically up on the stair right there 031218255 --> 031222337 i'll say for the purposes of ease there jester is up on that stair there 031225248 --> 031229099 nope up on top of this platform or off to the side 031231479 --> 031232721 there's a little raised section in the center there 031235591 --> 031242832 no 031249839 --> 031250822 caleb did 031251779 --> 031253163 laura and yes it does 031307328 --> 031309098 so you're back to consciousness you're at seven hit points 031310733 --> 031312389 correct 031313119 --> 031314271 no mage armor is not concentration 031317559 --> 031320181 yeah 031326160 --> 031327807 correct 031328691 --> 031329859 okay so she goes into a rage 031331567 --> 031332373 all right that ends yasha's go at the end of yasha's turn it's going to use another 031334339 --> 031338555 legendary action to use forced vision on you fjord i need you to go ahead and make a melee 031338555 --> 031344177 attack against beau as you glance around and suddenly she's right there in front of you and 031344177 --> 031347485 you take your falchion swing out to try and take her out 031347485 --> 031350062 yep so you have disadvantage on the strike 031351611 --> 031353423 but you do have plus d4s to each of the hits because of bless 031355842 --> 031400565 plus a d4 031401933 --> 031402993 yeah 031406521 --> 031409391 all right that ends yasha's turn caleb you are conscious prone floating sinking 031423189 --> 031426504 towards the ground as you come to consciousness as yasha grabs and jolts you awake 031426504 --> 031430838 yeah you'd get half cover yeah 031433122 --> 031435898 getting up from prone 031437481 --> 031443072 yeah you can get cover 031444424 --> 031453321 that's 4d12 031502635 --> 031507946 correct so you have to roll a d20 add your spell attack modifier 031512379 --> 031514034 yes technically because he was concentrating 031517361 --> 031522222 her armor class is 15 i'm so sorry 031531821 --> 031533457 you release the witch bolt and as it fires out and arcs in a split-second moment the eyes go 031540095 --> 031545069 wide and she darts out of the way and it impacts the side of the stone wall you watch as the 031545069 --> 031549548 seaweed she was clutching is burned and falls away for a second and behind it you see another one 031549548 --> 031552263 of those runes just sitting there in the chamber 031552263 --> 031554787 that's your turn all right back at the top beau you're up 031557631 --> 031559538 actually at the end of caleb's turn 031603025 --> 031605009 she has three she's going to use her last one she's going to go ahead and use shifting 031614741 --> 031618762 speed so she's going to move her speed without triggering opportunity attacks 031618827 --> 031623817 (background music) 031623817 --> 031627617 actually she can move ten more feet so right there 031630602 --> 031631688 yep as you watch she skitters across the wall grabbing the seaweed and using it almost 031637363 --> 031641138 tarzan-like to thrust herself forward grabbing onto this bit rolling and then swimming around 031641138 --> 031645874 and is now floating in the air or floating in the water right next to where caduceus is standing 031645874 --> 031649639 beau what are you doing 031649639 --> 031653512 from you right now 031655147 --> 031658709 30 feet from you 031701218 --> 031707463 so you jump off the ground and swim forward cruising through the room step of the wind you 031719499 --> 031724461 get one extra push and you land right next to where she is 031724461 --> 031727991 go for it 031731262 --> 031738277 yes because you are underwater still 031748770 --> 031755362 the first strike as you come forward this is the first time you get a really good look at 031758941 --> 031804022 the face of this terrible creature and as soon as you come towards the mouth opens up and you 031804022 --> 031810069 barely hold back from the punch and that just gives it enough time to shift out of the way and 031810069 --> 031811452 it just hits water 031811452 --> 031817539 that hits you know now that 15 is the armor class 031820832 --> 031825003 wisdom ability checks got it 031826594 --> 031827174 nine nine points of damage as the first one misses and pulls away you're like nope 031833472 --> 031841781 whack and then right across the jaw (cracking sound) cold and hard there's a toughness to her 031841781 --> 031843039 all right does that finish your turn beau 031844642 --> 031845454 all right caduceus and jester you're up 031846956 --> 031848016 she did technically move around and would've passed through your 15-foot radius by the way 031852417 --> 031853348 so she does have to make a wisdom saving throw a five plus one six so that's a failure 031900899 --> 031903025 go ahead and roll damage for your-- 031903025 --> 031904065 spirit guardians yes 031905455 --> 031906153 caleb and yasha are no longer frightened of dashilla okay 13 so you watch as she darts 031938372 --> 031945420 across the room as her legendary action all the floating seahorses suddenly dart up and slam into 031945420 --> 031949618 her side but she still manages to skitter past all right so now it's jester and caduceus' turn 031949618 --> 031953266 because you guys are players i'm giving you the initiative just before the lair action hits 031953266 --> 031956016 because you're all on 20 go for it 031956016 --> 032001491 on her turn all right 032003667 --> 032004563 technically the creature's movement is halved when it moves through 032022058 --> 032024362 it only barely skimmed the side so it would have lost five foot of movement so we'll say that 032026959 --> 032027962 dashilla is there 032027962 --> 032033907 no you're entering hers she has to enter your area however at the start of her turn it triggers 032042585 --> 032047328 ooh boy 032051681 --> 032053957 so where are you putting it 032100627 --> 032104604 like right here let her do it 032107118 --> 032108739 go ahead and roll an attack 032114573 --> 032119192 yes it does go ahead and roll damage on that 032121142 --> 032126065 well you cast it at 4th-level you said right that's 3d8 032129718 --> 032131189 because it's 2nd-level normally each level you put on top of that-- 032133342 --> 032135155 yeah for every spell level ahead of two you get another so 16 plus one more d8 032141871 --> 032143017 all right so that's 23 032146525 --> 032147553 no 23 double eights is 16 plus seven is 23 032154320 --> 032155433 yeah because of your wisdom so 27 points of damage whack the serrated edge of the 032201326 --> 032210217 lollipop grinds into her as it does black blood spills out from the wound of the chest the shreds 032210217 --> 032215481 of seaweed and cloth pulling off from the front exposing the sunken rib cage where the flesh is 032215481 --> 032221843 pulled taut against and now the wound itself is open and spilling this trail of cloudy black blood 032221843 --> 032222874 in the water 032222874 --> 032225474 yep sacred flame is a cantrip so go for it that's wisdom or dexterity 032230797 --> 032232287 dexterity save that is going to be an 18 032234973 --> 032236580 but that was a nice round 032237972 --> 032240137 all right finishing up jester's turn caduceus 032242995 --> 032246478 you just watched her dart over you essentially ten feet up above scoot past land 032251315 --> 032256451 and then both jester and beau converge and start pummelling her in the hallway 032256451 --> 032302600 welcome to dungeons &amp dragons 032309231 --> 032317510 okay dexterity save that is going to be a 14 i don't believe that-- 032324165 --> 032326274 yep so go ahead and roll damage on that 032329979 --> 032336323 nine points of radiant damage nice (spell impact angry snarl) 032340512 --> 032345115 so you turn invisible and you're going to back up into here into this little corner 032355180 --> 032357498 oh there 032358460 --> 032402138 over here 032403361 --> 032406594 got it and you are invisible there good to know all right at the end of your turn the lair 032413414 --> 032420060 action kicks in clouded waters now you watch as the silt the muck and the bones all of a sudden 032420060 --> 032426160 begin to swirl up into the waters around you and obscure the area the entire lair is now 032426160 --> 032430364 considered heavily obscured you cannot see more than five feet in front of you 032430364 --> 032431501 it's now dashilla's turn she gets her legendary actions back 032437096 --> 032438679 oh she's not affected by the obscurity this is her lair 032448046 --> 032449537 she does so immediately she has to take the spirit guardians 032451949 --> 032454030 wisdom ability checks not saving throws otherwise hex would be super powerful but she 032458991 --> 032500003 still rolls a 4 032500003 --> 032500777 so do full damage 032502441 --> 032505275 okay 032507957 --> 032511901 13 points of radiant damage blasted again as this cluster of vibrant glowing almost pink 032520367 --> 032526358 pulsing sea horses swirl around and pierce through her chest 032526358 --> 032527617 unicorn horns of course i assumed 032529673 --> 032531599 they're just like wee 032535884 --> 032537794 it's very like that perry bible fellowship comic 032542444 --> 032543793 the kid gets impaled by the unicorns i love it so much all right so that happens the top of 032549644 --> 032556427 her turn yeah nobody's currently feared by her 032556427 --> 032559338 no it lasts until the beginning of the next combat round okay she's going to go ahead and do 032615823 --> 032619818 a multi-attack with her claws against beauregard because she's in melee 032619818 --> 032620917 that's two strikes against you these giant bladed fingered claws first one is-- that's a 032628012 --> 032630595 natural 14 plus seven that's 21 to hit 032630595 --> 032631218 the second one is a natural 16 032633354 --> 032634037 all right so you get hit from each you take from the first strike 12 points of slashing 032641794 --> 032650367 damage the second one 14 points of slashing damage in what already was clouded silt is now 032650367 --> 032655628 clouded further by your own blood from the slash marks across the front and the side of your neck 032655628 --> 032700321 and jaw and the pain sears through in an instant all you see is the claws streaking 032700321 --> 032704624 through and the glowing yellow eyes before they rescind back into the cloud 032704624 --> 032706527 well no she's going to attempt to move back make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage 032710501 --> 032714178 with that she vanishes into-- 032718494 --> 032722034 yeah just all over that's going to go ahead and end dashilla's turn fjord you're up 032727805 --> 032734796 yes 032735521 --> 032737352 you're a bit shaken by all these visions that keep creeping into your head 032740072 --> 032745272 yes i mean you saw her still dart and run this way and then everything just went dark 032750575 --> 032753482 around you and you can't see more than five feet ahead of you 032753482 --> 032759626 it's heavily obscured which means you can still attack that direction but it's at disadvantage 032809793 --> 032815928 mm-hmm 032818247 --> 032822767 okay wow that was-- 032837308 --> 032839486 all right two strikes at disadvantage go for it 032842993 --> 032848922 that still hits with disadvantage 032850693 --> 032854908 you watch as soon as everything clouds in and you see her vanishing in that distant area 032901372 --> 032908240 you throw them back out there and through sheer luck and remembering where she was heading both 032908240 --> 032913776 blasts-- you don't even see the impact but you hear the (gasp) roll damage on each of those 032913776 --> 032918207 nice 032929414 --> 032931064 oof there were some good rounds in that all right that's your action 032934026 --> 032936281 okay you're going to stay there by the throne 032938984 --> 032939606 that finishes your go fjord next up it is nott 032942262 --> 032946723 you have no idea where she is you know that she's somewhere in this tunnel 032949432 --> 032950189 or in that direction 032951608 --> 032959291 you're heavily obscured so you can literally hide anywhere right now 033010818 --> 033011779 you're in a cloud of murk and gathered sediment 033014462 --> 033015218 are you hiding then as a bonus 033022355 --> 033023023 roll stealth 033024993 --> 033026936 okay and then you are holding-- 033029808 --> 033034107 okay you got it all right that finishes your go yasha's turn 033037974 --> 033045041 yeah 033045929 --> 033047590 it's less-- 033112466 --> 033115298 yeah not that yasha would understand with her comparatively limited experience of arcane 033119976 --> 033124702 stuff but it's not so much magical darkness than it is as much of sediment and silt up in the air 033124702 --> 033128344 by some sort of-- it's up to her she can give it a shot 033128344 --> 033129279 all right 033130557 --> 033135768 while staying there 033137397 --> 033142165 you got it 033151766 --> 033152775 yes it does okay that ends yasha's go caleb 033158085 --> 033202846 okay go for it 033210626 --> 033211232 you cast detect magic in a 30 foot radius around you you sense a powerful magical essence 033216823 --> 033218483 from the throne next to fjord 033218483 --> 033219334 right there 033239046 --> 033242984 okay that ends your turn 033244506 --> 033246376 all right at the end of your turn dashilla's going to use a legendary action to use 033250467 --> 033256306 forced vision on you fjord as you're there by the side you look over by the corner and you see-- 033256306 --> 033302611 you don't see caleb you see a spirit rushing up towards you with an open maw go ahead and make an attack 033302618 --> 033304255 no 033305070 --> 033306213 because she had patient defense on 033307635 --> 033308543 he's not affected by it because of his armor he's got mariner's armor 033315581 --> 033317874 yeah no as you swing that little bit in the back of your brain resists and you can see 033332388 --> 033334088 for a moment through the illusion-- 033334088 --> 033336290 with your mage armor i think you're okay right 033339266 --> 033341262 yeah you manage to just pull back enough to pull the blade back and caleb you watch as it 033346231 --> 033348708 spins past missing you by inches 033348708 --> 033351358 all right 033357016 --> 033358757 top of the round it's beau's go 033402415 --> 033410411 it's made of fucking cookies 033418415 --> 033421274 you don't know 033422816 --> 033424461 she disappeared you're surrounded by cloud you can barely see jester at the peripheral and 033429069 --> 033433928 the floating spiritual weapon and you watch her vanish into this swirling bit of murk 033433928 --> 033436408 okay 033449885 --> 033458323 you got it all right so you're holding your attack action that ends your turn caduceus 033503279 --> 033504182 and jester 033504182 --> 033506410 correct 033507242 --> 033509354 you got it 033510850 --> 033511860 you reappear 033522341 --> 033532641 there 033534682 --> 033540018 oh like here

033634655 --> 033641677 sure go ahead and roll attack with disadvantage 033644914 --> 033649143 it hits the fuck out of nothing she's not there unfortunately 033652633 --> 033704322 okay at the end of the turn the sediment drops the moment it drops she appears 033716192 --> 033717085 she is over here 033720612 --> 033722119 nope but both of you get to fire at her you unfortunately do not see her she's around the 033726372 --> 033727791 corner from you 033727791 --> 033731202 so excited in the moment 033734896 --> 033736391 that's amazing all right so roll your damage 033742576 --> 033744706 yep 033745285 --> 033747540 natural 19 033749669 --> 033751065 next attack has advantage on her yeah she's starting to look pretty hurt as it blasts 033805023 --> 033810625 into her and lights up the vicinity between the gash and the various impacts from the eldritch 033810625 --> 033815635 blasts and the punches from beau and now where that impacted there's now a darkened burned 033815635 --> 033822888 crater in the center of the chest that's beginning to ooze out blood she's like (heavy breathing) 033822888 --> 033831767 all right reappears at which point the next lair action is going to be tethering walls any 033831767 --> 033836106 creature within ten feet of a wall must make a dexterity saving throw that's going to be jester 033836106 --> 033842709 beau's just out of range caduceus everybody but jester ten feet from a wall 033842709 --> 033845661 yeah no sorry everybody but beau beau's the one who's central to this chamber 033849724 --> 033851698 she does what's up 033853577 -->

grappled and you take 11 points of 033927803 --> 033928827 poison damage 033928827 --> 033930273 that ends that it is now dashilla's turn dashilla is going to go ahead and move ten feet up 033946591 --> 033947652 to jester 033947652 --> 033950106 well she actually started within the range so she makes it you do 033954919 --> 033956453 you do go ahead and make your attack 033959311 --> 034001487 16 hits 034002613 --> 034006222 correct 034007478 --> 034009071 20 points of damage oof nice then the save against yours a natural 19 so she takes 034020588 --> 034022252 half damage still roll 034022252 --> 034032935 five points of damage reduced to two she's going to rush toward you and take two claw strikes 034043593 --> 034052416 at you natural 19 wow fucking 19s this past round yeah

034105944 --> 034107938 17 points of slashing damage from the second 034107938 --> 034111788 laura and that's ten feet of movement and she's going to-- 034115363 --> 034117362 go for it 034119171 --> 034126867 nice dashilla's looking really bad 034136567 --> 034143331 as it happens these ice crystals formulate out of the seawater and all cross-jettison into 034149363 --> 034157462 her body now they're embedded in her chest and torso these large crystals of shards of jagged 034157462 --> 034202521 ice (snarling) eyes going wide looks around she's going to use the rest of her movement-- 034202521 --> 034204171 speed is halved on the movement so that's (counting) 60 034215151 --> 034216773 well not 50 technically because 50 is her swimming speed so right there 034221261 --> 034223430 sam and that's the end of dashilla's turn fjord you're up first 034226042 --> 034229265 yeah it is water there is a vertical aspect you guys can use if you want to 034241611 --> 034244387 okay there's this cloud of sand and dust and bones that get scattered up from your leap 034251813 --> 034255425 you're up in the air and then throw both forward roll attacks 034255425 --> 034301605 both hit roll damage 034306572 --> 034314104 19 points on the second one 034324901 --> 034327954 okay fuck man she's right on the cusp all right that finishes your turn 034335062 --> 034336234 legendary action she's going to shifting speed-- 034339506 --> 034340668 20 and is out of sight 034343497 --> 034344553 hex doesn't work that way that's hunter's mark all right that finishes fjord's turn nott 034353538 --> 034355835 (mini clicking on map) you still don't see her 034410331 --> 034416726 all right that ends your turn yasha 034418894 --> 034420448 he used action movement and bonus 034423430

034501002 14's enough the dc to break is 12 034504299 --> 034505880 it's seaweed but yeah she reaches forward and grabs caduceus and pulls him away from the 034512679 --> 034514376 side so now you're no longer grappled you can move 034514376 --> 034515735 that's her action and her bonus that finishes yasha's go caleb you're up 034518924 --> 034529858 you got it 034531144 --> 034532495 okay that

more 034632011 --> 034632975 you know the direction where she curved around though 034635908 --> 034636849 that finishes your go caduceus and jester 034641465 --> 034644307 okay 034658989 -->

you move (counting) 20 you get up to the edge there well 034830646 --> 034837172 technically 15 you only move 30 all right that finishes jester's turn all of the seaweed falls 034837172 --> 034841787 back into a casual place the next lair action is going to be the lament of the dead 034841787 --> 034843174 the dead spirits now begin to fall through at different angles out of the sides of the walls 034848585 --> 034852501 and drifting through everybody once more needs to make a wisdom saving throw 034852501 --> 034854179 everybody 034855481 --> 034857731 through the halls through everything

me i'll say with advantage because you have the falchion 034949917 --> 034953486 drawn you can sense the presence of something important 034953486 --> 034955187 correct 034955832 --> 034958089 13 will do it going to the throne and sensing with the sword like a homing beacon you 035007943 --> 035014058 feel the strong source where the cushion in the front of the throne is it's partially rotted and 035014058 --> 035021221 you can see where once was red nice velvet materials has blackened over time and general 035021221 --> 035026263 sediment in the area and then minerals begin to gather at the corners you reach down and tear 035026263 --> 035030945 across the front and pull it open and as you do there immediately glowing from underneath you see 035030945 --> 035035914 the yellow sphere giving off a faint aura of light 035035914 --> 035038796 i'll let you do that yeah 035042241 --> 035043459 you take it 035044604 --> 035046401 i'll say for the time being there is no immediate threat dashilla has fled you can 035104648 --> 035106500 continue to search for her if you'd like 035106824 --> 035110259 okay but for the time being dashilla has not-- at least for the time being 035114081 --> 035116533 it does 035120556 --> 035124854 okay you continue to move into the next area 035127485 --> 035133376 you scoot around the area beau you start moving through in this vicinity 035143622 --> 035145898 nott you doing the same 035147475 --> 035148029 nott you're not as fast as her so you're falling a bit behind actually no you can do all 035152934 --> 035156497 three with your bonus action well you both can just in case you want to spend ki points 035157019 --> 035158496 yes 035201639 --> 035207342 only the aura from the table 035212728 --> 035221914 okay make an arcana check 035229419 --> 035234306 it's hard to pick up the details of these particular runes they seem of a similar age as 035249767 --> 035259468 the ones you saw on the table but it's not the same enchantment you pick up that they are placed 035259468 --> 035304015 there for some reason but you're unable to ascertain what it is unfortunately 035304015 --> 035313578 right okay it is not a language per se these aren't passages or language being 035326604 --> 035330889 transmitted these are runes of some kind they are used to channel something 035330889 --> 035336257 they may or may not be connected to the table altar in the center 035336257 --> 035339153 yeah 035344498 --> 035346292 they both get brighter 035348464 --> 035352773 yes you may as you take the sphere and press it to your chest your eyes suddenly flash 035402414 --> 035414296 images of black sub-ocean darkness the same place your dreams have brought you over and over again and 035414296 --> 035423096 that bright yellow light emerges breaking the shadow and there you see the yellow eye with two 035423096 --> 035431452 more on the sides of it you see the endless row of teeth that curves into the smile-- and the 035431452 --> 035438489 flash is gone and you look down and your hand is empty the rest of you watched this thing 035438489 --> 035449200 momentarily seem to become either ethereal or it is absorbed into fjord's chest you look at the 035449200 --> 035452888 sword and now there's the eye in the hilt and the eye in the pommel 035452888 --> 035455617 while you're beginning to initiate the looting process what are you doing caduceus 035620512 --> 035631656 okay well you were staying over in this chamber with them nott and beau you are in the 035652508 --> 035658711 central chamber now do you want to search for the possible whereabouts of dashilla 035658711 --> 035704294 both of you make perception checks 035712679 --> 035714356 all right as you turn around the corner and you edge in here you see movement behind the 035733501 --> 035737773 seaweed using it as a blanket and a shield 035737773 --> 035740390 where you're looking you see it move this direction you're not sure which path but 035746176 --> 035754305 dashilla is still present it seems or something moving through the seaweed as a cover behind it 035754305 --> 035757616 like a curtain which path do you choose 035757616 --> 035804300 which way 035808724 --> 035810635 you saw her move in the direction of this fork 035813060 --> 035814348 this side you saw her move in this direction you saw it move through 035817198 --> 035817860 take the right okay you move through and you're following 035828087 --> 035828963 okay 035830099 --> 035840707 as you come around the corner you see an old decomposing pile of merrow corpses similar to 035859817 --> 035905825 the ones that were tied up inside but these all have these wounds of their throats slit from side 035905825 --> 035907697 to side 035907697 --> 035910853 they're all in various states of decomposition the freshest one maybe months ago 035916650 --> 035924912 and the sea has caused its own unique form of bloating and sloughing off of the various parts of 035924912 --> 035925986 the skeleton 035925986 --> 035926868 you can make another perception check 035931355 --> 035933312 glancing inside and taking a moment to really look around there's no other movement 035944201 --> 035945996 you guys shift around 035949944 --> 035953896 as you turn around to the other side there you see standing there another pale gaunt spirit 040002143 --> 040004564 looking right at you 040004564 --> 040009565 beauregard doing probably one of my favorite things she's ever done in this entire 040023553 --> 040028573 campaign just runs up to fucking punch a ghost go for it 040028573 --> 040030568 11 just hits 040037732 --> 040039991 five points of damage okay 040048049 --> 040054055 another five damage okay 040056794 --> 040058185 you still have your bonus action 040100217 --> 040102355 15 points of damage you punch the shit out of a ghost now because i believe at level seven 040116801 --> 040118557 you have the capability of-- 040118557 --> 040119950 to punch ghosts 040121381 --> 040125027 with each punch you watch as the somewhat spectral glow scatters at each impact and as she 040131309 --> 040135576 pulls back there are three holes in its form where the fists passed through the ghost which was 040135576 --> 040141210 normally just staring goes (ghastly groan) in surprise 040141210 --> 040142910 that is a three 040149029 --> 040156073 all righty nott are you doing anything 040204419 --> 040206419 ghost is still alive yeah 040207968 --> 040209700 go for it 040211647 --> 040214937 14 hits roll damage it is adjacent to beau so you get sneak attack on the ghost 040219919 --> 040224485 it dissipates you watch as its glow vanishes this horrible low dull vibrating sigh 040240017 --> 040245008 slowly goes away and it's no more and he's immaterial 040245008 --> 040248008 make a perception check 040254249 --> 040257538 both of you guys make perception checks 040259865 --> 040301719 okay you don't see any movement in that corner you do looking inside see in the far 040312789 --> 040327339 back a small hole maybe two inches across where the base of it-- of the small alcove-- ends you 040327339 --> 040329031 hear voices 040329031 --> 040330276 it's about two inches wide 040339799 --> 040344105 as you're looting the place you hear these voices 040347047 --> 040349466 okay you suffer three points of damage as you place your hand down on it you see this dull 040512701 --> 040522261 red glow around the hand that's placed on the table as you begin to pull your hand up and look 040522261 --> 040527010 the runes where the blood has splattered have begun to give a faint glow 040527010 --> 040528957 make a perception check 040534083 --> 040537842 you glance over and you can see a faint matching dull red glow on one of the runes across 040544186 --> 040550964 the way just barely peeking through some of the gently shifting seaweed looking down at this 040550964 --> 040554225 table you need a lot of blood to continue to do this 040554225 --> 040559361 how much damage are you willing to take guys 040605050 --> 040606468 as you guys begin carving into your hands-- 040615144 --> 040616565 okay the blood clouds the water around you and then you watch as it is drawn like a magnet to 040627363 --> 040634720 the tabletop as it begins to sit itself in each of the runes begins to pull in with each one 040634720 --> 040642555 glowing another rune and the rune (low sounds) it's almost full the table isn't there yet you 040642555 --> 040650801 have about two-thirds to three-quarters or so the room itself now is beginning to generally have a 040650801 --> 040653995 red hue to it as each of these runes is beginning to fill the area 040653995 --> 040655585 make an investigation check 040815395 --> 040817800 yeah 040818451 --> 040829610 i know you gather in pocket and counting it later you will find that you have found 040838861 --> 040849602 roughly three platinum six gold 12 silver and about 65 copper 040849602 --> 040850696 she's got an uncomfortable look on her face after watching all this transpire goes yeah i 040908333 --> 040909923 think we better should 040909923 --> 040912659 her brow tenses and she follows you out as you all converge towards the central chamber once more-- 040918710 --> 040920815 as you're walking some of the seaweed reaches out and the unicorns (fizzle) it lasts 040925750 --> 040934336 for ten minutes right as you approach they eventually flitter out you all gather there at 040934336 --> 040935826 the entrance 040935826 --> 040937496 are you all backing out of the cavern 040940605 --> 040944364 okay for those who haven't rolled perception checks on this which i think would be 040948052 --> 040952527 jester caleb and fjord go ahead and roll for me and yasha 040952527 --> 040954759 no sign of movement no idea where she is 041007452 --> 041015765 thanks to the glory of magic we're not going to deal with decompression in the bloodstream 041037966 --> 041039367 instant tpk 041040687 --> 041042197 well the magic is pulling-- yeah it's fine magic handwave it'd be the saddest-- smash 041048560 --> 041051657 cut to the outside of the squalleater 041051657 --> 041055506 it's all just the end of total recall right there in the middle of the ocean 041058537 --> 041100432 i know i'm saying through the magic it all works out fine as you guys all swim out of the 041104258 --> 041110522 cavern the spell happens with immense speed you all start firing towards the surface (splashing) 041110522 --> 041117042 with enough force that when you surface you all lift a few feet out and then land some of you 041117042 --> 041120749 stumble but you hit the surface of the water and it feels like ground 041120749 --> 041124471 you guys can see the squalleater is a bit of a hike from where you currently are from where 041150737 --> 041154995 you've traveled but it is visible as there is no other landmass on the horizon 041154995 --> 041158210 correct 041159270 --> 041201070 you guys make your way towards the squalleater hail your team and are brought back 041214489 --> 041223588 onto the ship the sails are unfurled as orly turns to you he goes where we going captain 041223588 --> 041234040 gravid archipelago all righty 041236692 --> 041239959 aye aye 041241321 --> 041243064 you're not there 041245776 --> 041247307 the ship unfurls the functional sails on it and slowly limps its way in the direction of the 041254310 --> 041304074 archipelago you travel for a good hour or so before you notice the sky that was somewhat 041304074 --> 041319132 cloudy begin to go rapidly darker roughly near where you were the clouds begin to swell and 041319132 --> 041324663 release rain it begins to rain on your ship but you begin to push away from this mounting storm 041324663 --> 041329651 you get the sense that whatever ritual you began once she felt safe she had completed and a 041337582 --> 041346725 new storm is being summoned over the diver's grave 041346725 --> 041352431 at least there would have been a hell of a skill challenge to get the squalleater out of the 041408682 --> 041416223 center of that storm as you barely skirt the outside of this growing storm with enough 041416223 --> 041420991 foresight and speed to not be caught in the brunt of it we'll end tonight's game 041420991 --> 041426175 bisaft isle to get repairs done 041436468 --> 041437831 all right we'll pick up there next week and we'll have a guest next week 041506720 --> 041507680 yeah excited we'll be having deborah ann woll joining us--

done guys that was fun and dashilla survived 041529876 --> 041531380 yeah if that had happened while you guys got out of the cave you would have looked up and 041544862 --> 041549009 that sunlight was much darker and it would have been you start seeing the shifting in the 041549009 --> 041551251 tumultuous surface and be like oh no 041551251 --> 041554413 sometimes you got to poke the badger and i respect that 041556899 --> 041558505 you did 041559859 --> 041607403
