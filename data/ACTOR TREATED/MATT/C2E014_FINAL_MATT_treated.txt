ahead and dive into tonight's episode of critical role goddamn it [click tv static] [groovy critical role theme] i'll remember this (laughs) noticing there was seemingly an attack upon the tri-spire by two xhorhasian assassin-type individuals you met with one in the sewer trying to escape from being seen by the local guard during this confrontation and did battle with a crick warrior of some kind you subdued it removed most of its equipment and conflicted over this strange artifact this beacon that it was carrying sent it on its way however it was quickly caught by the guard and killed you met on the surface the guard that were bringing the corpse and the object along managed to spirit away the strange dodecahedron from the grasp of the town guard and absconded with it you met with dolan and horris who're currently trying to figure out what to do in case they were somehow implicated with the events of the evening you took horris under your wing promising dolan that you would somehow smuggle him out of the city as it's currently on lockdown during this investigation you all then managed to try and find some sort of lead on what the next step would be went toward the evening nip apparently to seek possibly this individual known as the gentlemen of which you have heard of previously as kara one of the members of the knights of requital who had vanished seemingly had some sort of connection there so you entered the evening nip the rather dark and strange interior of the small dive bar gave the previously discovered words the code words that allowed you entry and were led down a long spiral staircase beneath the establishment into a subterranean bar upon which after immediately stepping into the space a black-furred female tabaxi approached mollymauk over here and with a look of recognition said lucien and then embraced you and that's where we left off so as you guys all watch this dark-furred tabaxi giving this big strong hug around mollymauk's shoulders pulls away and looks at you and goes it has been too long two ye-- two years (laughs) look at you you grew out your hair and you are covered in tattoos of course you-- these are your friends now very well as the tabaxi turns around you can see there is posted right off to the right and around the corner a hulking figure that has leaned around the edge that leads into this l-shaped tavern a hefty muscular ogre that is wearing patchwork hide armor and holding a giant maul resting on the ground looks back around the corner with these beady dark eyes and large looming jaw with angry broken teeth protruding from underneath going (snorts) looks at the rest of you other folks around are looking a bit confused at your entry right immediately to your left is a table with a rough-and-tumble looking cutthroat sitting there eating a sandwich with a half-drunken drink who's chewing slowly with this glare of mistrust in your direction there are two balconies up above you in the chamber you now get a better look up at the top there are a number of individuals posted and some of them appear to be drinking but there is at least one of them immediately in your view who has two skulking looking individuals with long dark cloaks and dark armor carrying what looks almost like a heavy crossbow but it's a long metal rod you've only seen them in use here and there but these are some sort of a rifle-like firearm that are usually reserved for the armies and bladegarden and to the far east of xhorhas a recently emerging technology that has been largely guarded within use of the empire itself 13 or so people in this tavern including the bartender the individual who rushed to you as you entered and various patrons around that you can get a quick bead on okay okay which as soon as you say that you back away and look right behind fjord as you all are standing there there's yasha no right behind you as if she had just come down the stairs with you well there's people all throughout the tavern but there's some music playing there's two musicians that are in the process of plucking away at two instruments everyone seems further in the chamber rather absorbed in their current rigmarole but you guys have just stepped down the stairs you haven't left the stairs you are literally standing right at the entrance of this tavern and you've all been taken aback by that encounter the realization that yasha had followed you down the stairs and whatever is about to transpire no at this point a hand claps and the tabaxi is now at one of the tables and has shooed off one of the drinks and goes this way i found a table for everyone oh too long i apologize for using your old name nonagon it is a pleasure to see you again nonagon was what you heard no the tabaxi said that basically what was said was i'm sorry for saying your old name nonagon was correcting lucien to mollymauk you don't know nonagon what happened we watched you die apparently (laughs) well that spell-spitter lady from the capital she said you were gone she took the book and left and her contract said she was in the right and that we knew better than to go toe to toe with her and her ilk unfortunately jurrel met with the axe of the law shortly after you left us zoran ottis and tyffial have all scattered amongst the empire but do you want me to find the others i know where tyffial is she's up in nogvurot we can travel there i can send a message and have her come down to us very well nonagon my apologies my name is cree i am a member of the well the family around-- how much do they know make a deception check both of you yeah technically all right sure i'll give you that i'll give you that well we were all part of the same order at one point and we splintered off luci-- nonagon had a different path in mind for us so we went north to shady creek run and we started the tomb takers it's just so good to see you i should inform the others of course the tabaxi curls in a little bit leans over the table towards you with this big grin and says does this mean that it worked there's a look of recognition well he led us away from the original order they were a bit clouded we had a new path there's a few looks now of-- the euphoria is washing away from the face he brought us onto a new path yes oh these are all members of the gentleman's troupe as am i at which point the tabaxi cree turns back and looks and you can see in the far back right corner of the chamber there is a long dark mahogany well-carved table there you see standing arms crossed a very muscular-looking goliath female with a very short leather strap top shaved sides of the head in a tuft of a mohawk that curls down into a long ponytail that goes down the back who's glaring in your direction sitting beside this burly-looking goliath you see a high-backed chair with a red velvet matte sitting feet crossed up on the table in a nice long deep-blue coat leather-gloved hands light teal skin jet-black hair that's long just past the shoulders a widow's peak in the center a bit of a dark goatee male figure standing there hands entwined and crossed looking at you from across the way with a curious grin the gentleman we had to find work we didn't know if you were ever coming back we thought-- so we had to move on we knew you'd eventually return i just did not know how long and we had to make ends meet work is fine-- you hear a (clapping) from the gentleman so we have company strangers in our midst he rights himself in the chair please come before me present yourselves i want to know who has graced us with their majestic presence come come the finger goes up and you watch as everyone holding the rifles cock them and point down at you come cree goes-- so you all go and sit there's a long bench there on the opposite side of this table where you can either stand or sit since there's quite a few of you jester is like i don't know what's going on sorry laura i don't know what the fuck jester would do jester is the most random character as you guys approach you hear this (wheezing laughter) there's the second balcony that was facing in the direction where you entered as you look up you can see there's another rifleman standing and hanging by one arm off the side you see this crazed-looking young gnome with this big mound of curly hair and this big chinstrap beard who's just dangling going (wheezing laughter) looking over you all from a distance really creepily the ogre's there still hand on the maul so introductions please i think i have an idea who you are but i want to hear it from your mouths please tell me i knew it i knew it (laughs) oh this is a gracious day very well welcome to the real evening nip pleasure to have you each and every one of you i've seen you around upstairs wandering and skulking a bit i didn't know you were part of this mighty troupe much better down here speaking of which a round please the bartender looking a bit frightened on the side starts filling tankards all right so what brings such esteemed adventurers to my pocket of the underworld oh i'm sorry they pull the rifles off you habit safety you understand so you have my audience interesting i have one question before we get too deep in this conversation how did you find your way in here go on demedan gave you this information equally dangerous good to know remember that the goliath cracks knuckles all right so interesting now you know the way in that's dangerous as we've just made acquaintances and you now know the direct path into my domain so to make this a comfortable conversation and possibly an arrangement going forward that we can all agree upon i have one small request cree please the tabaxi who was in the back goes yes of course steps over to the side of the bar and picks up a small leather satchel puts it over her shoulder walks up behind the table opens it and pulls out an alchemist rack of a bunch of corked vials like small vials opens it and says i need just-- and bear with me please-- just a small bit of your blood the reasoning being if i can't trust you and you can't trust me how am i to know you aren't going to turn me in immediately outside to the king's hall and i need some means in case you just abscond with this information perhaps make an arrangement with me and then leave town i need to find you oh that is cree's speciality as you pull your hand out cree does a flick of the finger and you watch as the blood trails off on its own like a small serpent of mercury and just (flowing) for a second even though it was a small wound it's bleeding quite a bit and you're like uh it makes you a little uncomfortable and then all of a sudden the blood flow stops the vial is filled about an inch full then she caps it thank you so much it's a gift that i learned the same place where the nonagon's gifts were found lucien next same thing fills the next vial a strange almost an arc of crimson finds its way and fills a secondary tube there's like twelve tubes there but she'll fill as many as needed for this one goes ahead and acquires the blood from you jester goes me too me too feeling left out in the moment gives her blood as well no harm will come to you unless you bring harm to me so this is just a precautionary measure i appreciate your trust with that your blood is taken into a vial your blood is also taken into a vial easy enough to do (spurting) the blood is drawn into the vial the final vial is capped cree closes the satchel places it on the shoulder and then bows and steps back paying direct attention to the gentleman and then out of the corner of her eye towards you fantastic i really appreciate that you're getting a closer look now of the gentleman the teal skin tone-- it's interesting it looks almost like he's perpetually sweating there's moisture on the outskirts of his skin at all times there's the faint hint of whether it be condensation from the air around or produced internally there's a general sense of dampness to the skin of this figure so an arrangement you say first off just because it's fun for me are you believers in luck that destiny is looking out for you i've seen enough in my time and have lived in spite of it all because something wants me here would you consider yourselves lucky travis sam and good then let's gamble then let's gamble i want to know how lucky my investments are gambit of ord who wishes to face me in this who feels the luckiest of your band all right great one pass 50 gold buy-in if i win you're mine if you win then we can do business all right he goes and pulls beneath the table a satchel of gold pulls out a handful of gold and plops it on the table you watch on the side as the creepy gnomish figure that was hanging from the balcony earlier leaps down (creepy chuckling) comes up and he pulls out a set of cards and is shuffling them in his hand as he steps around the side he's now flanking the right side of the gentleman so you have the large goliath on one side the small creepy gnome on the other shuffling the cards hands the deck to the gentleman does one final cut sets it down so what's your name fjord let us deal did you put 50 gold on the table make an insight check seemed to be above board okay the first cards are dealt out for the first round this is gambit of ord this is different from the crick-queen's call this is a marquesian card game roll a d8 but keep it hidden to yourself all right so now i'm going to go ahead and raise another 50 gold (clinking) onto the table well we deal with quite a large amount of business so you put another 50 gold all right go ahead and roll a d6 and keep that secret alongside that die do you wish to raise i raised first last time i'm offering you the chance to raise if you'd like interesting i'll raise another 50 gold go ahead and roll a d4 he's holding his cards in his hand looks across at you looks all throughout the room well fjord looks like it's time to call puts another 100 gold on the table (laughs) very well make an insight check for jester and you make an insight check as well since you were both keeping a close eye on that 22 actually there has been no weirdness with the cards this is a straight test of luck yeah you don't see anything nothing that catches you off so we're now at a pot of 150 times two 50 times two so 600 gold i believe right 50 50 50 and the 150 we started with 50 and then we raised 50 and then raised 50 so that was 150 so it's 600 on the table 300 from each of them all right he presents the dice that he had rolled or the cards that he had found which is a five a four and a one a grand total of ten as soon as you reveal the cards there's a (gasp) a gasp in the room and the gentleman his muscles tense for a second and he goes (laughs) well-played and well earned take the coin it's yours good to know that we have luck on your side as well that's very important to me with people i do business with so (clears throat) you have some balls throwing down that change and going into a game with me i like that so what can our many gifts and my associates present to you what are your strengths what are your skills i've heard you've done some deeds i've heard you killed some terrible creature in the sewers is that correct right which helped tremendously because we use the sewers quite often that had become an issue with some of our transference in the subterranean sewers of the city and unfortunately the underworks themselves have been a bit clogged as of late so thank you for that and one of our compatriots-- and he points up to one of the balconies on the side and you can see behind the individual that had the rifle you see kara the half-elf who's stepping forward ever so slightly and says one of our compatriots has kept us up to speed about your infiltrations i have to say i'm impressed not too bad well we are a company that specializes in the completion of the tasks and trading of things perhaps not the most legal things that are restricted by the empire that means our skills are best through speed subterfuge darkness we don't have the best aside for muscle besides from well (laughs) i do keep sorah by my side just in case that is the goliath he refers to sorah very good well you've caused enough chaos in the tri-spire you brought down one of the more corrupt though strangely uncorruptible from our end politicians we've seen and from what i hear lord sutan is already in chains (chuckles) that's fine we'll see how long sutan stays in there he has his ways depending on how strong a case you've left behind and a little finagling on our end if our partnership grows mutually beneficial perhaps we could push that over the edge for him and keep him away for quite some time now apparently i've also heard they're still seeking the murderers of the high-richter particularly a purple-skinned tiefling who was spotted not far from the home that night with rather ostentatious clothing as well as a wandering dark-skinned youth a woman with physical capability so that doesn't bode well for you does it well as seeing as how we're friends now i can say that i could probably make this investigation go away (laughs) no this is an investigation that you caused no my associate was making sure that the events would transpire in our favor but nevertheless we were not the orchestrators of the knights of requital oh well many gifts come once we've established a partnership we become friends now and i like friendship that's great that's fine but i deal in trade mostly so i would like a favor in kind he leans forwards a bit and you can see some of the condensation slowly dripping down the side of the face making a few spots on the table as you hold a napkin out the eyes catch you for a second the head turns confused for a second about a mile out of the underworks beneath the city down the underground river pass that our shipments to the ounterloch and berleben pass through one of my men noticed a strange wall uncovered by time we sent a team of our best infiltrators to see what this was about within a purple light and the promise of ancient spoils seemed to peek from within some sort of abandoned research facility from ages past well my curiosity got the better of me so we sent the team inward to seek it out but amongst these few gold-laden objects that enticed my men-- they are a superstitious lot-- and upon being beset by series of phantom globes they fled and collapsed the entrance behind them you see him glare past you and hear the shifting of a few pieces of armor as three individuals avert their gaze (sighs) so those fucks have failed i would like you to return to that site for me find a way in inquire within seek and seeing as how you are so good at eliminating monstrous beasts clearing the space of any dangers hostile creatures return with any of your findings do this for me and i will see that the scent is thrown off you permanently i'll even let you keep some of the spoils of course by all means do we have a deal let's say i've lived and worked a solid 15 years orchestrating the seedy underbelly of this entire city i've never been caught i've never been arrested and i thrive on a pile of gold and riches you can only begin to imagine good make an insight check i mean he's a shifty individual being by nature but it's hard to get a sense of whether or not he would be trying to lie (laughs) little one (laughs) you intrigue me young green-skin so overtly walking amongst the nobles above and yet you've kept your throat that says a lot about you yes please tell me what would this trial be you would ask of the gentleman cree fumbles in the pouch and brings out three of the empty glass vials and hands them over to you hmm certainly i feel confident reasonably i'd say the alcohol is a bit more brackish the acid itself is a little more translucent but you could possibly add a little bit of alcohol to it you're an alchemist you've dealt with varying chemicals so i'd say given a moment you could go ahead and match it fairly close sure make a sleight of hand check versus his perception 15 total all right you present the vials (chuckles) this one is alcohol this one is alcohol this one is acid and takes the acid from your grasp and uncorks it and drinks it so roll the damage for your acid it should be on your break down of your-- i have it here actually so yeah roll 2d6 11 all right so he (slight cough) (grunts) downs it but it doesn't seem to have as much of an effect on him it looks like it hurt and he takes it the muscles tense a bit the face twitches as it goes down and it burns but then he takes the vial and corks it again rolls it across the table (coughs) does that satisfy your inquiry (chuckles) good good i like it we deal well in secrecy my friend lucien was it (chuckles) very well correct the sooner the better because we can begin opening that line we've now two weeks and three shipments lost right this would be dolan's partner yes hmm we specialize in discretion and specialize in smuggling and specialize in people so you do this deed we'll consider it part of your gift good very good quiet one now we have access to the tunnels of course we'll have to blindfold you to bring you through the underworks to the tunnel that leads to this underground river when you decide to leave just because there's a lot of secrets down here and we're still building our trust but come back in whenever you're ready we'll be happy to escort you and send you on your way oh as long as we have our arrangements if you've proven yourself trustworthy enough in the long term perhaps but understand that this is just a precaution who's to know perhaps things go sour in a few months i want to make sure you don't double cross me and send the guard down make an insight check it's more that he's lived this long by being careful and when a bunch of strangers find this secret pass into his lair he wants to be damn well sure that he knows where to find you if need be i don't know who any of you are outside this bar don't worry anyway and he throws his feet back up on the table  drinks are on me until you make your leave at the moment it does not appear there's a weapon immediately on the goliath but as you look behind in the corner right behind the chair where the gentleman sits there looks to be one hefty-ass maul a giant chunk of solid metal with a long handle on it that is resting against the stone they like to break things yeah there's three guys there's the bar in the chamber next to that to the right of the actual bar there's a doorway that opens up into a storeroom it's underneath the top balcony underneath the balcony right next to where the ogre is posting watch in the center of the tavern the three of them are sitting off to the side looking uncomfortable they were sitting earlier and since all of this happened they stood to attention and haven't found a comfortable moment to sit down yeah you look over and you see two of them appear to be human relatively young probably mid to late 20s scruffy-looking one of them has a darker fro-y hair that's unkempt and covering part of his face the other one has very short cut hair dark complexion brown red they're both wearing darker leathers and cloaks that are thrown over one shoulder they're holding tankards in their hand and they're both talking amongst each other while keeping an eye on you the third one appears to be a halfling female who is sitting in a corner quietly sipping out of the tankard and looking nervously around just the two of you approaching oh make a perception check a fur-covered tabaxi it's hard to make any details out beyond the fur unfortunately the two of you approach the corner kara is watching you as you step past and steps back on the balcony out of sight she goes-- as you approach the two gentlemen and the female halfling they just watch you they don't engage you verbally at all they just keep an eye he takes it the guy with the larger curly hair takes it and pours it into his own and sets it back down thank you well-- and the other guy elbows him and he's like (whispering) shut up look we signed up for this to make quick money we're good at moving quickly we're good at seeing what's worthwhile we're good at picking things out we're not good at dealing with spooky fucking undead ghost things okay we went in we went through this path we found a crack in the wall we kicked it down we went inside there was a staircase went up and down went downstairs it seemed empty it was confusing we didn't see anything of interest went upstairs the staircase-- the little spiral staircase-- and there was a much larger chamber we started looking around for anything worthwhile it looked like it got picked clean long ago dust everywhere the more we began to look there was this cold temperature in the room and eventually these little lights began to come out of the wall at first we were curious by them one of them got really close to therad over there he suddenly shocked in a serious jolt and you see him on the back looking a bit spooked recalling the story he goes we knew then these-- whatever the fuck these things were-- they weren't friends of ours so we got our shit and we ran we had a small explosive so we threw it behind us to collapse the wall hoping that at least it would slow them down we realized in hindsight that it was pretty stupid because if they were spectral enough to come out of the walls they still could have followed us we got up the river from there we got our boats and made our way back they both look at each other and look at the halfling the halfling's like i wasn't going to stay behind we didn't go into the bottom chamber that looked ominous enough we stuck to the top one it's just a big octagonal dome chamber had this faint purple-ish glow on the inside--  look you can come by and sass me all you fucking want i've been here for two years you newcomers walk in here and think you're all tough shit you think it's so great go go in there come back you think you're tough shit you go take care of it make an intimidation check 13 15 he's looking over at you you can see him swallowing hard hey no i understand that that's great looks like you guys are much more well-equipped for this shit than we are look i'm not saying we're better than you we're better at some things you're better at others that's why they're sending you in because we can't fight fucking ghosts you go for it it's stone but sure (laughter) all right the guy who's talking to you says that's hannah there i'm louis he pauses for a moment shakes your hand now go get this thing okay cree is still standing by the bar with the satchel on as you stand up and start approaching she smiles indeed i can tell you it's so good to see you well you had acquired the tome with the ritual spell that you required to attempt to reach the city that lady-- i don't remember her name the spell slinger from the capital she came and oversaw and performed the ritual for you i don't trust those folk but i trust you and if you trusted than that was enough for me you gave us a speech we had a fine meal we all got ready there in the forest she said it would be hard for us to tell whether or not it worked at first but we went and checked and you were not breathing for a good hour you were not breathing and you had gone cold we knew then that-- that we had lost you we checked and i'm very attuned to vitals as you know there was no heartbeat so we waited longer the sun rose and nothing so as you told us if anything were to go wrong we had to get rid of any sign any trace so not far from the tomb taker hideout we buried you and we went our separate ways she took the tome the mage woman it was part of the arrangement you had with her make a deception check you're starting to get in deep into this now make a perception check you start wandering over but there's too much noise and general din in the chamber around you to make anything out of course right of course lucien please please do there's a moment pause and then cree takes in the hug too there's a faint purr in the ear and then you hear the voice whisper it's good to see you me too as you walk away make an insight check yeah seems forthright no it's bloody water it's water with a hint of iron aftertaste glancing around no other than kara who you had spoken with previously nobody else catches your attention no she's not watching you she's receded into the top balcony into a chamber behind that is correct make a perception check 17 as is the nature of a seedy underbelly there are a lot of individuals who are very interested in the newcomers that waltzed in made a deal with their boss and have sat and had a drink and are talking all sorts of business there are a number of folks that are slowly creeping in make an insight check you don't have to roll deception if you're not lying you go through a door and there is a switchback stairway that leads to the upper balcony area and as you head up there it looks like there's a weapon rack which has a bunch of weapons set up kara's currently sitting on the edge of a bench and is sharpening the blades small daggers and stuff and looks back oh hello sets it aside look i'm sorry i didn't mean to deceive anyone but that's my business i was keeping some things close to my chest like i'm sure you do look i deceived no one outside of what you needed to know we got our business done i've done nothing wrong what do you mean oh the crick attack on the tower no had nothing to do with us we're not going to work with those savage beasts go for it that wasn't planned by anyone if anything it might have saved our asses because it made what you did small potatoes by comparison i'm thankful it happened but look those things continue to attack us from the eastern border and from what little information's coming through it's getting worse with each passing week so the last thing i want to do is let any more of them into our backyard look i know my limits i'm not some mastermind i want to make some coin i want to work with one of my skill sets make the boss happy i stay mainly within the city i don't want to deal with any bigger stuff than that i'm just a girl it's one of convenience keeping it short for you it sure beats pickpocketing in the streets and being beaten when i'm caught about eight years i worked my way up as far as i know yeah it's not good for business that's true but-- i don't know his whole plan per se but business works well when things are predictable right and when there's war involved things get real unpredictable emotions are high the amount of armed guard and military gets high we're forced to skulk in the shadows until it blows over last thing we want is for all this to get any crazier then dolan's a good man he's not caught up in all this don't try and mix us up in that right he doesn't deserve it generally no most of the folks that work with the gentleman and that we work for are well-paying because they're well-off some of them aren't the most moral either we don't do anything that hurts the folk that don't deserve it at least from what i know we don't kill we don't murder we just move and sell and deal in various goods that aren't perfectly legal no right well if i have a friend that makes it high in the political chain of the city-- dolan-- and i have the ear of the gentleman that's a mighty powerful ally to the underworld without that ally knowing well there's good money in being the middleman if this works out to be honest it sure beats having to shuffle in the shadows i work better in public anyway it's what i do for the gentleman now you too sorry-- stay safe you know where to find me or at least ask about me now looks like we're in bed one way or the other all right you join up with the rest of the crew you guys have all gathered again what would you like to do that's not me that is just a gift from the traveler this is why you don't miss a game laura anyway it a dark graphite-colored blade that's hooked in places and this gradual sharp it's a longsword so it's not the beefy thing you're used to it is a hefty blade what you're used to this one's a little smaller it's still helpful but it's your call i think you could use it with your hexblade you can use it two-handed do a d10 but that's up to you it's not as hefty or as sentimental as the one you have it's taller than nott no it is over her shoulder and by her side to lay it out the whole room is shaped like an l here's the far end and this is the chamber you guys entered from this side around the corner the ogre's right there the bar's up here and this is where the gentleman was yeah no problem boss said it's fine he has practice it's a little spilled it's a little messy you approach the ogre the ogre who's standing roughly ten 11 feet tall it is a male ogre wearing patchwork hides and fur over one shoulder large belly rippling muscle arms the maul held in one hand resting against the chest deep angry jaw that has jowls that swing as it turns its head to look towards you both the eyes are dark and beady with a brown iris you can barely see under the folded brow as you approach it (snorts) (confused grunt) literally rolled an intelligence check to see if he got it and did not kutha yeah what's happening (grunting) clawing at the jaw trying to pull it down (groaning) you do this this terrible grinning ogre who seems confused with the facial muscles not functioning kutha k-u-t-h-a kutha you guys make your way back up the spiral staircase out through the trapdoor in the back storage room of the evening nip exiting past the bar where clive binz sits there waiting with his half burn-scarred dwarven face who gives you a nod as you exit back into the city-- now i believe in the late-afternoon near dusk-- the sky

congrats all right bringing us back into the game you guys have all reassembled with a moment of your thoughts on the outside of the evening nip just as the sun has set the oranges and purples of the sky have taken over with the little bits that you can see beyond the cloud cover that still seems to permeate the atmosphere above you with the recent storm mostly passed it seems at least the gray skies are clinging as hard as they can what do you wish to do the sun has recently set jester has it yeah inside the backpack you left him at the leaky tap yeah so you guys head back to the leaky tap you head back to your chambers and within the one room horris has been very careful as soon as you open the door horris immediately grabs the nearby chair and like gets ready oh you've returned sorry just i'm a little jumpy how are things going how's the search been i trust you yeah okay no that's fine (sighs) thank you i can't even begin to express my thanks i've been staying in here i've been looking out the windows there's been more guard activity in the streets it looks like they're making their way inward into the city and beginning to inquire at least from what i've seen that's it other than that i've just been bored and reading this book (chuckles) yeah eh no there aren't any pictures (clears throat) anyway oh right you can buy cantrip scrolls but not-- right correct you cannot transcribe cantrips right yeah it was and paid the difference there you go always skirting that edge i lived that life for three years paycheck paycheck paycheck paycheck it's gone anyway very well just tell me what you need from me or what i should do you didn't specify but that seems like it might be a viable plan what dm's always here i'll step in one of the other rooms is there a key i could-- okay he leaves the room as soon as he leaves the room jester goes okay so tell us about you each we'll find out in a second all right all of you who are in the 15-foot radius it's being cast in which would probably be everybody you're all staying close on this everybody please make charisma saving throw charisma saving throw you are the only two that succeeded everyone else you have to speak the truth yes you all sense the energy come over you and for a second you're a little confused by it you watch as this large cluster of moisture all of a sudden solidifies around the outside of the blade and the blade is now encrusted in jagged ice shards that just stick out the steam coming off of it mist i think she was asking yasha as the nature of the spell you know you are under the effect of it and you can be dodgy if you need to but it's up to you yeah plenty of things that are sharp yeah i mean there are jagged parts of the wooden frame of the bed okay you watch as this bright vibrant light billows out of it glowing in the vicinity similar that you've seen it encase the scimitar as far as i can tell yes he did indeed poop his pants oh that too yes make a religion check oh yeah you've definitely heard of the moonweaver the moonweaver is classically more of an elven deity they are a god over night of shadows music there's a lot of variations to what they go over but they are definitely not one of the approved religions in the empire and is not considered one of the betrayer gods classically is an inspiration for a lot of art in classic elven history even some modern the caretaker of evening trysts has a lot of unique history to the moonweaver no not at the moment how much do you show and also there's only a couple minutes more left on the spell about now the spell has dissipated the spell's gone you can still press her you know go ahead and make a religion check with advantage he what yes to everybody who was present at the table and remained within the vicinity at the moment yep yeah you're familiar with these entities they're generally undead orbs that-- that haunt swamps haunt areas where they seek life force to siphon it and devour it they're will-o'-wisps all right you guys all turn in all right an evening's rest takes you as you all take a while ruminating on the events of the day the information acquired and the path before you you eventually find yourselves to sleep so you can take your long rests for the night are you doing anything with the sword yeah the one that you took from yasha are you-- not yet okay anybody else anything all right then as the morning comes to you all wake up relatively early because you went to bed relatively early it's shortly after sunrise you find yourself conscious some of the first to really hit the downstairs tavern for breakfast food is served drinks are had and the morning and day is yours what do you wish to do you can do it if you want okay so you focus on it and as you lie there concentrating on it you extend the essence of whatever pact you've made with this entity into this weapon as you finally finish the period of time you hold the blade in front of you and it vanishes into the pocket as you force it to apparate once more in your grasp and the blade returns it has the same hooked shape but now this blade is encrusted with barnacles along the base of it edges of it have curved around and water continues to drip off this it seems to have transferred whatever the essence of this pact blade is to this one at this moment you realize whatever weapon you seem to bond with in this way will carry that same aquatic essence based on the communion that you've acquired okay classic beauregard zemnians jester will stay as well there you go oh boy all righty so for those of you who are making your way towards the pentamarket you eventually find the outskirts of the invulnerable vagrant you enter the interior and there are two other individuals that are doing business with two of the pumats you do not they seem to be just asking questions and looking about the vicinity you do not okay so as you enter the chamber and you see the two pumats are busy the counter is currently not helmed and they're mid-discussion but one of them turns and kind of acknowledges you enter oh that's real nice to see you just relax there a bit if you need help immediately we can see if prime's available yasha that's a wonderful name i can't help you because i'm helping this person but just hang tight a second pumat he'll be right with you you see two of them that look identical in the room something like that he'll be right with you turns around you hear a couple of heavy footfalls what sounds like a toppling of some metallic pan that (clattering metal) like ah shi-- hello the curtain opens and you see one of the pumats but with a set of goggles right above the head an apron on with a bunch of different tools and various accoutrements stuffed into different pockets hey so i'm helping someone who needs help right now you've been here before you're working with the other ones all right morning morning to you hey can i help you ashley i just-- i mean do you have chinese stars throwing stars oh are you talking about a dagger or a dart or something like that you can probably go to a blacksmith and get that made for you i don't really craft things here from their base components we generally take them and i enchant them to a better degree i make generally not-so-great things pretty great yeah and you're catching that pumat prime is a little surlier than the other ones he seems like he's a little more down to business than the various versions of him out there ah interesting you're going to be dealing with some of the spiritual realm you say all right let's see pretty sure i got maybe a vial or two of holy water if that's what you're looking for that's not usually my purview but we keep a couple in stock just in case let me see what i can muster goes ahead and rummages through in the back you hear more metal and glass clanking and one box gets shifted off to the side ah dang nabbit all righty comes out i've got two vials of holy water remaining those will run you about 25 gold pieces apiece if you want them well look at that it's like it was meant to be straight up destiny ah well you see funny thing with all of these adventurers keep coming in and clearing me out we got maybe two more but you got to give us time to restock you guys your friends here have been mighty hungry those will put you back about 50 gold pieces apiece since we have the friendly discount of repeated customers isn't that right one of-- me's one of the pumats goes that's correct they've been in here a few times he's like all right great thank you for looking out there buddy all right so-- yep oh you're referring to that protection cloak let's see here (grunts) takes it off the counter checks it that'll run you back about 800 gold pieces well you watch the demeanor shift a little bit from like the i'm busy like well happy to see a big spender coming on first thing in the morning you start seeing more of the connection with the other pumats well might i have your name i don't think we've had the pleasure personally fjord-- fjord tough pumat sol prime and i believe this is now known as fjord's cloak you're looking for a discount for the healing potion make a persuasion check i know but hey you never know 14 you know what i'm not going to lie i'm kind of a fan of the no-nonsense kind of a lady so sure i'll throw in a ten gold discount on each of those healing potions so that's 80 gold for you for the two all righty here you go okay that's all right simple requests are always open what do you need yeah more of that wizard stuff i got that for you i got two ink vials there those'll last you for a little while get that going for you some parchment 100 gold friend thank you very much pleasure doing business with you well i do have one enchanted dagger if you're so interested well this one when it's thrown if it misses it comes right back to you if it misses if you miss with it it's pretty useful i don't know about incredible look i'm just being straight with you it's a pretty useful thing on occasion i mean no offense to any of you here but i got to get right back to work looks like one of my me's is available to help you for the rest of this-- yeah no well let them know thank you so much have a wonderful day it's a pleasure to see you again you too nice to meet you as well big lady he takes his goggles down have a good day he turns around and goes into the back chamber it's funny him saying big lady because he's huge he's bigger than you are he goes into the back and goes right back to work and you hear another foot hit the pan ah i need to-- aw man the ceiling's probably about ten-foot hi sorry about that i was helping a customer but he's left now not purchasing anything so i'm happy to help you what can i do for you all righty well have a wonderful day and come by whenever you like big spender i saw that coming along fine i think that's part of what pumat's working on right now i'll see what we can do thank you thank you all right thank you easily enough at the blacksmith for the sake of brevity here yeah you can pick up-- for a single dart which is the equivalent we'll say there are darts and there are we'll say throwing stars sure why not because of the archive's nearby there probably would be a use for them they're not often called for it's probably a surprise that somebody wanted to purchase them but they have about 20 we'll say throwing stars which act as darts for five copper a piece okay so the transaction completed you have a bunch of these throwing stars they're metallic they're triangular in shape and bladed at the edges pretty light sure go ahead and roll a d20 you throw it towards this post and it (whoosh) (whinnies) this horse all of a sudden bucks and kicks the side of the stable nearby and you hear the wood crack from the kick all of the sudden you hear voices of the two stable hands trying to hold back this horse so it's 19 throwing stars caleb molly and jester actually as you guys are walking back you notice that there are now clusters of about three or four crownsguard at different places that are in the process of asking questions to people going from place to place and inquiring right she's not with you you're right yeah like talking to people asking questions okay you guys make your way back to the leaky tap there what little horris had on him a little bit of change and materials to leave is ready to go beau and jester are propped and ready as well i assume what do you guys do yes thank you thank you whatever you need yeah okay easy enough all right as you guys make your way towards the evening nip horris is looking a bit nervous but does look around and seems genuinely very thankful he's like seriously this means a lot to both me and dolan thank you probably hold on that until we get-- we'll say for the purposes of this you're pretty close to the evening nip when you do this he's had too much to drink you guys enter the evening nip clive is there at the end hey you're a friend with a bag all right (grunts) he leads you to the back shoves things off of the latch pulls up the trapdoor down the stairs and you eventually make your way back into the tavern below where mollymauk is waiting nervously drinking that's okay okay gotcha all right as you guys head back down horris is like i trust you guys i trust you you make your way down the room is not as busy as it was last you left there's maybe six individuals in there most of them are the individuals who were previously posted with rifles or new individuals also posted with rifles up at the top there is the gentleman finishing a meal at the table with sorah his bodyguard at the side ah i see you've made it he sets the things down pushes the plate to the side so i take it this is your contraband very well and you would wish this smuggling to head where our cleanest to be fair our cleanest means of smuggling out would be actually through the river after you pass through as that leads us to the northern swamps of berleben and that would be probably one of the safest spaces still easily able to keep him out of sight and to a safe space out of the crownsguard's watch great then we'll wait an hour after your passage forward and send your contraband on his way to safety with two individuals to escort him and lead him to civilization beyond the outskirts sound fair very well take care of him please they pull the shoulders of horris back and horris is like all right be safe and you know what kara and we'll say dweez you go ahead and lead them down to the-- lead them blindfolded of course through the underworks to docks and send them up the way to their agreed upon task you see kara come back through one of the doors on the steps and behind you see that creepy gnome from earlier sitting behind (creepy chuckling) kara goes all right well and she pulls a few pieces of cloth it looks like they're used to moving individuals through and they have already prepared blindfolds in place she passes them out to you and instructs you all to put on a blindfold and take a hand okay who's at the very front and who's at the very back of this chain fjord front who's in the back okay who's after mollymauk jester all right who's after jester okay nott so there and we have frumpkin trailing behind at the very back so fjord at the very front kara takes your hand and begins pulling and in the very very back caleb this tiny gnome hand grabs your hand and goes (heh heh) hold on (heh heh) they loop you through the room a few times to discombobulate you and direction in the chamber and pull you through in different ways to prevent you from orienting where you were and where you're going eventually you're led through a doorway you hear some things shift and then turned around a bit and then led down a ladder the ladder goes down for about 20 or so feet before your feet touch some sort of soft dirt packed dirt-type feeling the sound of the music and chatter vanishes up ahead and you hear as soon as you all head down the ladder a latch close and lock above you your cat managed to-- actually make a stealth check for frumpkin five as frumpkin's trying to trail behind dweez turns and goes (heh) no (heh heh) and puts a hand out and grabs frumpkin by the scruff and holds frumpkin up and then throws frumpkin back into the bar okay okay dweez is clutching the back of your hand and goes (confused sound) (creepy laughter) okay so you head back down you are led down a tunnel it weaves a bit you turn to the right down another tunnel for 100 200 300 feet frumpkin back in right you can see this a bit these are tight individual tunnels it feels almost like a mine in the fact that it has occasionally a wood structure for support between it a lot of it is packed with earth that's been carved out eventually you'll split off into two and you'll see what looks to be a small resting chamber with another set of tables and a bunk you go past another area and there's occasional torchlight set up on parts of the wall you can see a couple of shifty individuals that are in the process of stacking crates somewhere yeah they'll walk by you and occasionally look one of them will stop and inspect and move on no one seems to fuck with you at the minute because you're with kara in fact one of them seems to get close to you and looks and sees dweez and goes (ugh) and just moves on you do hear a noise a strange like (guttural animal snorting) and you hear (whip crack) (animal grunting) echoing down the hall you move around one spot and there's one archway that frumpkin passes by looking down and you can see there's a pit and there are a number of cages set up in there about four of them that have different creatures inside it's too low-lit for frumpkin to really see from this distance what's in there but one of them is currently having a bit of a conniption fit and you see three cloaked figures that are on the outside one of them is trying to whip elements of it that are coming at it the other one is trying to prod it in the sides and it's getting agitated at this point it smells like wet dirt and earth that's about it it smells like a dank subterranean tunnel as you pass by the creature smell you can smell hints of dung fresh and old and some sort of pheromone like a very strong pheromone that's very unpleasant the scent continuing on you move through another tunnel another figure walks by and stops as you pass and watches you as you continue down another set of stairs and then eventually the echo begins to get a little louder your feet hit wood frumpkin can see this as you pass in you've hit a dock this is now a natural cavern the moisture catches you first what was initially a somewhat cavernous damp has now become very moist and you can hear the slight sound of a river moving through frumpkin can see this too there's an entire underground river that is now curving past this entrance way leading in two different directions along this river you can see there are a few lanterns that are set up with this soft greenish glow they're perpetually burning in certain areas and are bolted into the rock and stone there on the side of this dock you can see four different boats that are currently roped and tied to the edge there there is a figure sitting on a stool who is taking a dagger and moving it on the edge of one of the wooden poles that is on the very outside end of the dock at this point all of your blindfolds are removed and you've come to the end of this part of the journey kara says sorry about that but you were respectful thank you she collects the blindfolds and dweez who is still clutching your hand lets go and goes (creepy chuckle) kara goes all right two of these ships are yours to use you're heading up that path there about a mile or so it's with the river thankfully so the stream will be carrying you through a set of paddles to each of you whoever wants to helm that that's up to you pay attention from what i've been told you'll see the change in the texture of the wall on the left-hand side traveling northward look for the small collapse on that end correct be spry sometimes some creatures do find their way living down here so be ready to move past quickly or find a way to duck them if you can all right good luck we'll be fine the guy at the edge of the docks sits up and kara goes the back two for these folks let them go gentleman's orders he doesn't say anything just sits up you see the hood that's up he pulls it back a bit and you can see there is this older grizzled human with very short gray hair deep scar across the back of his head that curves off to the top of where his receding hairline is it's just been very deep-set where the skin dimples heavily along the edge of the scar he's got this very scruffy gray and white beard his head's a bit sunk into his shoulders he walks over to the edge and unties each of the boats and hands the rope to one of you the first one goes to fjord and the other one just goes to beau goes back to his station and sits down sticks his blade in the side of the wood and keeps wedging it in there you get a better look up there and you can see this wood is splintered to shit on the top this guy has been over time slowly pushing away at this wood for whatever amusement he needs to pass the time down here where he's stationed these boats look like they'll fit about four people each so we have fjord jester molly and beau in one boat and yasha and caleb and nott in the other is that how it is okay two oars on each side yeah you guys all get in it rocks a bit as you all adjust your weight and find a place where the boat itself isn't listing too far to one side or the other the river current is pulling it along so as soon as you step off the last person holding the rope they immediately start following the current of the river which is not rapid but it is moving at a fair speed you all gather yourselves and follow it down and as you progress you notice those green lanterns that are lit only seem to cover the vicinity of that dock until eventually you are going into a pitch black cavern hmm you're all alone all right so as the orbs-- (singing) there you see her matt and this one you throw this isn't an oil this is water okay roll a d20 and add your dexterity modifier what are you doing add your dexterity modifier it goes right past you hear it (splash) into the water below the chamber seems to shift at times sometimes it squeezes in where it's just the river and the edges of the tunnel at about 15 feet from side to side the ceiling is roughly 15 feet as well 15 to ten feet sometimes it coasts down and becomes a bit lower it is a natural river so-- (echoing) oskar as you guys head deeper into the subterranean tunnels towards your destination weapons at your side prepared for whatever comes in the near future-- we're going to go ahead and end tonight's game we don't have laura here we've had two episodes that went four plus hours my back's hurting a little we've been here for three hours so yeah before we get too deep into this we'll go ahead and pick up next week when laura can join us we'll pick up from there once again guys thank you so much for tuning in check out the awesomeness of 826la and the stuff we are doing with them check out pillars of eternity 2 and the really cool stuff that we are doing with them and yeah we'll be back into this next week until then guys have a wonderful week we love you and is it
