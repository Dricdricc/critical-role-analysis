information about that this coming monday at critrolecom i believe those are all of our announcements and with that let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of critical role [tv static click] [groovy critical role theme] while that era of the story is transpiring i want to ask you guys since we have a moment here-- or in the loose wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey period of figuring things out as you recover from the intense return to the ship what would you like to do is there anything you want to check up on first of all everyone leveled up to seven this would be the long rest-- for everyone but fjord i guess this is that night we will then begin to embark on what that journey will be but if there's anything you wish to do before the evening's done we can say this is while fjord is out you get to remove that item and you get to add it to your-- pocketed it is not magical it is sentimental okay as you reach back into your waterlogged hood of your coat you hear this tiny little (coughing) and there you pull out this extremely waterlogged and unhappy crimson weasel (chittering and coughing) he pees in your hand there are three rooms between the group i think that have been given to you and the people that have been moved to the mistake as everyone concludes their evening activities the journey looking at the map and the distance is about 800 miles to darktow from urukayxl yeah essentially the ship normally-- now it's not centered whatever it's fine you guys deal with your map it's not mine it's your map do what you want not my responsibility your ship is actually traveling faster than it normally was as part of the blessing that avantika received it can achieve about 55 miles-- no an entire day of travel which is a bit faster than a general sailing ship which is why the mistake can go faster but they're a pair you're looking at about 14 days of travel to darktow yeah welcome to being on the open seas man they don't have bullet trains in d&d you have 11 days of supplies there will have to be some sort of supply stop or a way of handling that that is going to make this journey not an issue when it comes to supplies look at that (singsong) divine magic you don't have to stop then all right great not to get to darktow at darktow there will be repairs made to the other ship and possibly some small repairs to the ship for its journey and any other supplies you would need while there it's a 14 day journey at full speed during this time a couple of things one you guys can decide to if you want to learn how to run a boat that being the case we get to decide what types of skill sets you want to pick up on out here in the ocean that being the case we have the quartermaster quartermaster is the one who has the most authority other than the captain of the ship they take over if the captain is unable to they divvy up plunder or whenever you board a prized vessel they decide what to take and what to leave they generally helm that whole process there as far as pirate ships are concerned there is the navigator or the sailing master you do have orly hired to do that for you but orly can also train one of you to be a backup in case orly-- you can both train under him if you want to you can overlap we have the boatswain boatswain is in charge of the ship itself you know keeping it in top shape for travel and battle they handle looking over the wood the canvas the ropes making sure that everything's solid and functional they lead shore parties for supplies and repairs and oversee activities like dropping and weighing the anchor setting the sails cleaning the deck things like that start thinking of things you might be interested in there's the cooper which makes and maintains barrels for storage food and water there's the carpenter which is the one that actually repairs the ship's structural integrity when it takes damage they answer to the boatswain they keep the hull the masts and the yardarms functional there's the master gunner who organizes the placement of shot powder the fuse and aiming the ship's cannons all right so nott's going to want to train as the master gunner and of course powder monkey which is the next one below who basically runs all the stuff powder monkey apprentice as powder monkey and should it be needed you'll become hopefully a good master gunner those are the most important aspects everyone'll learn a little bit about sailing as you go but start getting an idea if you want to right now which one of those you'd want to specifically begin to focus on yeah makes sure that all the canvas the ropes the wood everything's in good condition we'll find out train as the boatswain which actually to that point the next morning as everyone begins to go about the first real day out here in the lucidian ocean clear blue sky with dappled bits of cloud around you the smell of sea salt and foam and spray making its way as it splashes across the front of the bow avantika catches up to you with vera being called up to the side she goes vera if you'd be so kind i would like to call-- let's say the utmost members of the crew please to the deck maybe some of your friends as well as you all gather on the deck avantika goes i appreciate all of the hard work you've put into this my crew and yours as we are making our way back it is important that we properly balance as we endeavor here and make sure that both training that has been inquired about is properly disseminated and out of curiosity and with no disrespect to you vera i will be replacing you as the ship's quartermaster until we return to darktow with our captain tusktooth vera looks taken aback and briefly offended and then but of course my captain quartermaster time to start paying attention she begins to divvy out responsibilities to the rest of you in the various positions that you requested to start learning some elements of the journey have you moving over to the mistake some have you moving back especially for the repairs elements whoever decides they want to be the carpenter unless none of you want to that's up to you it's up to you makes and maintains barrels that is the boatswain there we go note that somewhere on your character that those are the positions you're training on this journey all right cooper got it powder monkey for now a few days into this journey we'll say because you're training as the carpenter-- jester the mistake is keeping in time with the squalleater and you're brought-- it slows down a bit and you're brought over to the opposite side and there looking around you wander under the deck and find at one of the tables waldok who's one of the deckhands of the ship he's currently sitting at a table with a large tankard of really rough grog or ale biting his lower lip and he has his sleeve pulled up and you can see orly has this unique bowstring of some kind that's wrapped between two fingers an inkwell and a needle that's tied up in it and he's currently halfway through doing this really good-looking elaborate tattoo across the arm of this deckhand he's got his patch over his eye right up against one of the portholes where the light's coming through and he's using it for perspective and he's lording over this smaller thin human and glances over oh hey there yeah you keep watch and he's doing this curled mermaid that is coming up and on one hand is holding on at the hip and the other is picking a fruit off of a tree you begin to question the design a bit and orly says offhand it's what he requested he's sitting there going like (grunting) well i had a rough fight with some scurvy a few years back and a few things i like the idea of ladies in the sea that can save me from scurvy orly chuckles under his breath it's very well done and you can see now the other tattoos that are across his body were probably done by him on himself i wasn't aware actually but m-m-maybe you should ask around for the man who's doing the repairs around this place i can try and teach you some of-- -- m-m-my skills however i got a specific talent with some of this here kind of here do you m-m-mind the guy's like uh sure orly helps show you how he threads this and gets the needle set up go ahead and make a performance check we'll say dexterity if you really want to 17 picking up where the initial partial ink sketches were you actually continue to fill in the rest of the upper torso you do a very good job you can see where the style does shift in the art but it's not abrasive it just continues and it is rather nice he goes um no i appreciate that but no he starts to pull his arm away from you orly puts his giant tortle hand on your shoulder and goes i don't recommend m-m-messing with the artistic vision there you are i like the idea of that point of order-- point of order you don't happen to have any sort of gem dust do you yeah oh i have plenty of ink it's m-m-more-- m-m-more or less i picked up this technique years ago from some of the individuals that spawned from the legacy of the island folk it allows me to instill a m-m-mighty ink spot as he does that he flexes his arm and the tattoo shimmies every so slightly and his muscles bulge a bit see it's not so much something that can be easily taught more that it's something bequeathed by an elder no we'll see how time goes by for the time being just let me know if i can be of service he talks to you about it and he gives you an overview of his capabilities for different types of gem dust he can imbue somebody with a series of tattoos that can alter elements of their physical self it's not inexpensive and each person can only have it once ever so it's not like you can have multiple for 2200 gold worth of a ruby dust he can imbue a permanent +1 to strength for 2200 gold worth of emerald dust he can do a permanent +1 to dex he runs down the stat sheet there the most expensive one's constitution that's 2500 worth of diamond dust there are all the different gem types there he can also imbue certain resistances those are more expensive those are 5000 gold worth of fire opal dust for fire resist and 5000 gold worth of black sapphire dust for cold resist he has the capability of imbuing essentially magical permanent tattoos yeah that's something you can see aspects of based on what enchantment it is-- like on orly his is specifically an aquamarine dust it has this faint aquamarine light blue shimmy to it as soon as the light hits it it glitters across aquamarine dust being the one that boosts charisma (laughs) m-m-many folk have said that well looks like you're just going to have to keep me employed for quite a while don't get me hurt he goes back to finishing up the tattoo on the individual that was waldok (grunts) okay all right roughly eight days into this journey you've moved about 100 miles off the shore of the southern island of bwuali when a small horn sound goes off on the squalleater (horn call) it's a small horn it's a very small horn i know this wasn't meant to be an epic horn that i totally failed on this is intentionally a small horn glancing at the top you can see avantika has climbed to the center of the mainmast and towards one of the crow's nests up top and looking down points to you fjord and goes quartermaster call two of your compatriots that you trust to the top with me you guys climb up the mainmast to the crow's nest and there you see avantika with a spyglass and she leans in to the three of you directing mainly towards fjord and goes now that we are at sea i want to show you something she pulls out the spyglass and holds it over to you and helps you point it in the direction here you see a vessel a little ways off on the horizon a little bit north of where you are a northwestward direction she whispers over your shoulder so the rest of you can hear glancing at this ship ahead of us it appears to be a concord ship a shipping vessel probably carrying trade goods it appears to be equipped for rapid travel but we could head it off as my quartermaster i ask you for your opinion what should we do take a look what do you see make a perception check okay glancing at it it's a pretty well made ship it's meant for speed it doesn't appear to be heavily manned it's not carrying or transporting people it doesn't seem to be a transport ship of any means you see a handful of small sailors on board with a hand crossbow or a saber that's sheathed at the side you see on the deck a handful of crates that were not kept beneath which means it's probably pretty well-packed it does appear to be concord colors since it's traveling southward you gather it's probably recently finished-- especially with your experience as a sailor-- finished stocking up on all its materials travel supplies and its goods based on the path it's heading southward it's either going to arc around to tal'dorei or be heading in the direction of marquet or possibly if it's feeling risky the shattered teeth depends if we can do so quickly without losing any sort of momentum perhaps not all ships are boarded and there is a loss of life most i'd say probably 80 percent of encounters out here is just intimidation most let us take what we want and continue on our way they don't want to die well to be fair there are plenty of assholes on these waters so it does not surprise me but it is your choice i say you may talk amongst your friends but there is opportunity not unless they-- how do you say-- they are stupid either or make a perception check okay you make out the same details as he does nothing catches your attention nothing about it seems out of the ordinary per se but it does seem to be a vessel that is filled with its payload and making its way south make a perception check an aggressive trade interesting what is your decision you watch as this playful look on her face as she watches this discourse turns into this extremely intense joker-like grin and she goes well then welcome to piracy my friends come she jumps off the side and heads the ropes down and begins shouting off commands to people on the ship the sails shift as the ropes are being pulled-- all right bouldergut yes bouldergut is on this ship she has been moved from the mistake partially because bouldergut acts as a bodyguard to avantika and because the other ship itself is in serious need of repairs they assume probably don't put the giant heavy ogre on it sure enough bouldergut is down there currently getting ready with a giant great club that is carved from an older masthead what right for show she looks back and avantika goes oh don't worry you are the quartermaster you are the one who is to be boarding any sort of ships that we encounter so you choose your people at this point you watch as ipess who is the second mate of the ship this sunburned gnome begins scurrying up the rope to go ahead and put their flag on display ipess i-p-e-s-s the flag on this is a dull gray purple color and it has a similar sketch of the same eye tattoo that avantika has on her chest as that goes up and the ship begins to move to intercept glancing through the eyeglass in the distance you can see the other ship noticing the approach and there is now a bunch of chaos as they all begin running up and down the ship notifying everybody else on there what are you doing to prepare guys the angry tough red-bearded dwarf that actually acts as the cannon master of the ship that goes by the name of ophiscan duth i'm interested in possibly getting involved but this is too much fun to watch keep going goblin i'm liking it two of the other deckhands who act as powder monkeys are also helping get things organized though i would recommend if you're going to fire do a warning shot tends to get them a bit spooked in their boots and slowing down across the bow not at the ship in front of it away from it but just enough to show a little bit of power there's a bit of a range of error with these weapons they're not a perfect art at this point the sails are fully unfurled speed is picking up the other ship was trying to gain speed and it is a very fast ship but as it tries to move away it ends up putting you at a parallel pace at which point the master gunner leans into you and goes ahem about now would be fine i think we want them to slow down eh he gets behind you and-- not quite like making the vase in ghost but is trying to help show you exactly how to set things up and get the cannon ready and aim it powder place the shot put the fuse in aim then fire yeah go ahead and make an intelligence check okay you light the fuse (sizzling) what order did you put them in i don't think that's how-- i think you fucked it up i think that's-- right we're going to have to clean that cannon you're going to have to clean that cannon all right we'll move over to this one so you begin setting up the other cannon so you put the powder first put the ball get the-- (explosion) the other cannon goes off there's a shaking sound with splintering wood and a bit of smoke in the vicinity you glance over and that cannon is fucked at this point ophiscan sees this and knowing your skill set goes go back upstairs there's a lot of powder in this room upstairs fireboy go go get all right so you owe us a cannon try again we'll see if that would help a destroyed cannon that's a lot of material a single break or tear-- no that cannon's fucked all right try it again the dc is lower this time because now you've fucked up you've managed to head them off they're managing to get speed and they're curving this way and you guys are curving to meet them yeah without issue this time proper order with a rapid pace halfway through ophiscan's like eh sorry you set it light the fuse (explosion) the whole thing lurches back about two feet and there's a large wooden platform that catches it from the impact the room shakes for a second and you glance through the little side of the gunport and you watch it hit the water maybe about 40 feet out from the front of the other ship you hear shouting from the other ship and you watch as it starts to slow and come to a slower crawl it begins to give up its chase this is more for just a visual perspective well no this was sent to me by fans of the show who actually make these and then this i had custom made a while back in case this ever came around yeah lasered in just to give you perspective as you guys pull up from the side of this eventually the two ships are brought in anchor is dropped this is yours here this is the squalleater on the opposite end the crew has all moved up to the deck they have weapons at the ready but not necessarily ready to fire they're in the process of realizing they don't have much recourse at this moment the rest of avantika's crew or at least a number of them have come up on the deck in support but you're the one who's helming this what do you do the squalleater oh their ship yes to give you kind of a brief perspective here what you see on deck off to the side those are the people you see some of them appear to be deckhands and aren't armed aside from a small shortsword on their side a couple of them appear to be a little better dressed but none of them are warriors they don't appear to have a very visible guard on the deck of the ship no go ahead okay soon as that sentence comes to an end you hear a rapid clattering of heavy wood against wood it's all of the various ports and doors in the interior of the ship all manage to slam open at once all the members on the opposite side look at each other make an intimidation check a 22 they all look at each other and begin to back even further away from the edge one of them rushes down and goes deeper into the ship and a moment later returns with one figure which appears to be better dressed than the others you see very bright blonde hair and a relatively well-dressed leather tunic over decent captain's clothing he comes to the front and goes i am the captain of the stormcap who am i to be parlaying with i am captain jules errog of the stormcap and i would very much like the lives of my men spared what supplies do you need perhaps there can be a trade organized his expression gets really confused it's like okay avantika is on the other ship just leaning against the opposite side watching this happen just keeping an eye on everything looks across to the rest of his men looks over towards you again okay the intimidating thaumaturgy-casting smeed okay do as you will bouldergut takes a step towards the gangplank and goes grrr looks over at avantika who shouts perhaps not having her on the plank is a good idea bouldergut backs up and does a running jump and hits the other side and you watch the ship shift in the water from the impact and the weight of this ogre so now you have that a fire bolt make an intimidation check okay the captain thinks to himself and nods he turns and steps aside from the doorway that he's been standing in okay at your disposal right there would probably be vera who is the previous quartermaster but she is a bit older not quite geriatric but is in her older years vera ipess or norgul vera norgul is her name who are you calling a giant bushy bearded gnome comes by and he has his shortsword drawn all right let's do it lead on the three of you make it across the gangplanks and now the group is four of you including bouldergut the large opening that leads down into the ship the rest-- the captain's quarters is underneath in the back okay as you head down almost everybody who's on the ship is up top you see a few figures that are deckhands cowering in rooms they're scared shitless and when you begin walk past you hear (shushing) they're trying to stay quiet you're in the captain's quarters what are you doing make an investigation check a number of shipping ledgers there are books keeping tabs on payments to the crew and how long they've been hired there is one paper you do find that is hidden in a locked compartment beneath but you manage to find underneath this little bit that you can slip your fingers through and pull a sheet of paper out on the opposite end of the shelf this is a list of the supplies on the ship there is food and water for the journey there are clovis concord spices menagerie coast specialty dried meats tropical fruits that are specifically frozen and brought so they're slowly thawing through the journey to get them as fresh as they can where they're going this looks like this journey was intended to go to marquet to port damali the bay of gifts amongst all the various bits of general supplies cloths clothing and silks that are specific to the menagerie coast there are some elements of empire goods as well that are put in there but the thing that catches your interest there is one last addition everything else seems to be written in one type of handwriting and there is a different type of handwriting in the final entry and the final entry says requested package guarded and the amount that was paid for that was 1800 gold that was received by the captain on this ledger to keep on the down low in here you do not not within this chamber okay while you're looking are you waiting for beau or are you heading out beau joins up with you guys actually as high your investigation check was and you continued investigation into the room in search of any sort of thing you do not find this package but you do find underneath under the small tossed somewhat mildewed rugs that mark the floor there is a section of floorboard that pulls open and there is a small chest that is locked when you pull and shake it a bit it's filled with quite a bit of coin it's pretty heavy as you are moving and shifting it it sounds like it's filled with a lot of coin bouldergut grabs it with one hand and walks over as bouldergut makes her way onto the deck you can see the captain notice it and sigh loudly men please to the bow of the ship they all begin to shift and make their way that direction as the captain begins to move goes all i ask please is leave enough supplies for us to make our journey does not break eye contact with you and gives you a serious dark glare it certainly keeps the other side nervous you go past into the cargo hold which is below here on the level where the captain's quarters are and just below there's the rest of the cabin quarters for the rest of the crew and then below that is the cargo hold as you make your way past the various hiding other members of the deckhand crew down in the lower cargo hold there are a series of crates and barrels that contain all the supplies that were on the ledger you would assume all the different trade materials which ones okay they're all trying to keep a distance from you scurry down and begin lifting things at which point a voice below goes what's going on and they go shh they begin to move things back up to the top make an intimidation check eyes wide the pupils gyrating in a very quick shaking motion i don't his name he came with one of the pieces of cargo he just stays down there (panting) and continues to grab and pull the crates up from across the other side-- yes bounds across the gangplank on the other side what do you need she heads down to the ship with you the whole boat okay the chest does not emit a magical presence in order to really check the other ship you have to go across onto its bow and scan and walk across it it's a 30-foot okay as you begin to make your way over towards the bow concentrating on the spell a tiny little magic source below you deep in the ship catches your attention in the other ship yes while this is happening-- you guys head down into the cargo hold make a perception check okay looking inside it is lightless and appears to be empty aside from the series of crates and shipping containers that are in here other than the ones that you've had moved up to the top between the three of them they've done two quick up-and-downs they've brought a fair amount of supplies so far and they'll continue if you tell them to no because you spent your turn helping her technically it's both of you looking okay looking through frumpkin's eyes make a perception check you're just keeping an eye okay so you're just keeping tabs on the situation they all look at each other the captain steps forward and goes for what make a persuasion check go lieb that way lieb i know so close one of the deck hands looks and he goes what me onto the squalleater he comes across the gangplank over next to you he's just like i-- what while you're prepping he just looks over at the captain very mournfully and the captain's like-- make a dexterity check so over the next ten minutes or so you'll be able to provide a fine tattoo of that simple design you got it he's biting his lip (groaning) okay you move ahead into the hold about ten feet or so there's a small pathway that's built between all the different elements of crates and barrels making sure that you can get to the back of the hold they're not a sponsor as you move around the corner in a flash you hear (grunting) you see this quick arc of steel as suddenly from around the corner a fairly well-armed man with sun-darkened skin short hair pulled into a tight top-knot or a bun of some kind holding a longsword two-handed swings at you three strikes that is 24 to hit that is 18 to hit and ooh that is a 26 to hit three hits there that is 16 points of slashing damage 13 points of slashing damage and oh 18 points of slashing damage avantika listens and goes ah i trust he can take care of himself eh now i need you to roll initiative you to roll initiative and roll initiative for yasha and i'll do for bouldergut 25 to 20 beau you're 18 oh so yasha's up first okay good to know yasha is up first seeing this flashing of blades across fjord fjord gets knocked back careening into some of the nearby crates they shift from the impact you hear the cracking of wood as soon as the figure pulls back getting the blade into defensive position backing up against a corner with that was set with a table and a chair and this is essentially the guarding post of this figure below there's a very faint bit of light in the corner from a hooded lantern that's been faced towards the inside of the crates so it wouldn't give any sort of light that revealed his location you see him going into a defensive position yasha's up first yasha armored yes half-plate go for it 11 misses the blade scrapes across his armor no impact the first one scrapes across the armor causing a couple sparks to fly and briefly lighting up his position the second time he actually pulls the longsword up and manages to parry and cause the blade to completely miss impacting and getting stuck about an inch into the wood before she draws back angrily gritting her teeth that ends yasha's turn beau you're up all right 19 hits all right roll initiative stunning strike on him that's a con save that was out of the box there he has a pretty decent con but he only rolled a 15 what's the dc 14 yeah he saves on that one it's eight plus your proficiency bonus plus your wisdom yeah so the first strike hits him across the head but he manages to resist it he pulls back (grunting) teeth gritted 20 hits roll damage for the second strike six points of damage you don't know it seemed to be pretty decent he rolled a 15 on that one but you can try it again another ki point that is a 12 first strike no impact he pulls back he's rearing to try and deflect or at least keep you at bay the second strike as you crack right across the side of the head he goes down onto one knee you see him his eyes go wide as they're rolling a little bit in his skull and he's currently trying to shake-- you rung his bell you still have your bonus action with advantage if you're-- five points of damage he's stunned and on his knee okay that brings us to bouldergut's turn (laughter) bouldergut there's not a lot of space here so i'm going to give her disadvantage on her attack because she has to try and swing this large greatclub in this enclosed space as an ogre charging by (roaring) comes down to do an overhead strike actually it would have advantage because stunned so it's just a regular roll let me try that again yeah that's a natural 14 that hits for that he takes 13 points of damage on that hit the other attack-- 17 that hits another 15 points of damage nice as he's on one knee bouldergut comes around and she slams he almost falls to the ground again the giant impact slamming into the back of the metal-- you can see that actual armor dented inward from the impact she pulls up for a second strike down on top this one actually sends him down on the ground he's trying to get back up from that impact the back of the armor is pushed in it's limited some of his mobility within his shoulder blades from the way the metal's pushed towards his upper shoulder that's going to end bouldergut's turn it's now frumpkin's go 18 hits that ends frumpkin's go fjord you're up make an intimidation check because he's stunned and beat to shit i'll give you advantage on it okay that ends your turn yasha's up okay make an athletics check for her with advantage because she's raging okay he fails strength and dex saving throws doesn't say anything about abilities-- i'll say yeah she grapples him that's fine beau you're up he's currently being held by yasha and looking right over at fjord who's backed away hands up that's your turn okay it comes to his turn he's being held by yasha and he shakes off the daze grits his teeth and just throws his sword to the ground four points renegade one point paragon yasha's still clutching him there yeah he's still being grappled by yasha without saying a word there's this look of defeat and acceptance of one's pride he's just trying desperately not to engage more than he has to and glances over towards a crate that is across from where he was sitting that would still be in his visual perspective but it's an unsuspecting crate pushed in a cluster of others he looks in that direction and gives a head nudge okay no make an insight check hard to read he's a pretty grim fellow what did you say okay all right whatever you want please just let me go you lift it up looking inside there's a few heavy sacks of rice or grain or sand you can't really tell but they're all lining it for weight on the crate in the center there's a pillow or a piece of folded fabric that's folded in place in the center you pull the fabric back and there you see a very intricate wooden box it's about maybe that big it's about the size of a shoebox if you will but it's really well-scrolled and carved wood like a whittler or a carver spent a lot of time to make it look very beautiful and presentory it has these chain handles on the sides that dangle on the edge it has a little latch on it and it's locked yeah it's pretty light the captain on the stop says something like are we done yet i don't believe so (spitting) you've already guaranteed i lose my job and my wage what more can you take from me i was 150 gold upon my return you just slip it into his pouch he looks confused and untrusting like he's caught off-guard by it soma he just glares at you okay there you go nott beau catches up to you on the other ship there are two of the other powder monkeys that are currently playing cards yeah it's pretty well-made is prayer of healing concentration when you came in yeah the source of magic was that box yeah soma i'm a hired protector it is when people like you come in here and ruin it you'd be surprised how much of an industry revolves around just that he's taken aback even more i will say you are definitely the strangest pirates i've ever heard of he nods begrudgingly it was he looks over at the back part of it that's been smashed to shit by the ogre's greatclub there are a number of crates in the vicinity checking for traps you have to get close and inspect it all right go for it make an investigation check it is trapped it's a fairly complex trap mechanical you gather it's probably what's inside the box you could attempt to disarm yeah that's what mage hand can do as yasha's still clutching him there he's like-- make a thieves' tools check please with your dexterity as the gentle mage hand clutching the thieves' tools begins to do this weird ghostly finger dance across you see it go (clicking) ting you hear a spring break as the mage hand shockers the box sure you hear the spring break on the interior and it seems the trap has been disabled that was disabling the trap now you have to open it roll to unlock it there are three locks there's one lock in the front and two on each side rapidly they come open okay you go to open it up and the inside it's soft velvet interior of the case there you see a small ceramic pot of some kind roughly about that big that has a lid on it and it is enclosed then above it mashed in there a paintbrush about a foot long a little pot of paint it looks like the guard glances over and goes this is bullshit this is fucking bullshit yes i don't want to talk about it i've already given you too much let me go amongst my pride swallowing i don't know i do mercenary work out of port damali from time to time and other places along the shore normally some of the higher-paying jobs are a don't-ask-type scenario that is very true he's just giving the thousand-yard stare into a shadowy corner all right bouldergut stops and turns around toward him and pats him on the head and then follows up behind you guys captain jules errog says no would you please leave us if you have everything you need (panting and whimpering) he runs back across like (panting) (laughter) (whimpering) the captain gives a nod thank you for sparing the lives of my men as you guys come across the rest of avantika's crew pulls over the gangplanks they pull up anchor avantika looking over the opposite side goes do not pull up your anchor until we are beyond your sight if we see you shift beforehand we will turn right back around the other crew nods sails unfurl wind picks up ship begins to move you begin continuing to head westward once you're a little bit out of earshot and avantika's keeping an eye off the edge of the ship looks back to the rest of you and (slow clapping) the rest of the crew begins to clap and there's a bit of applause with that my friends welcome truly to what it means to be free on the sea i'm proud of you so let's see what you found they go to start opening the chest and we'll take a break there we'll get to that when we come back from the break we'll be back here in just a moment in the meantime we do have our wyrmwood giveaway for the evening for this you need to head over to the critical role twitch chat that's twitchtv/criticalrole to enter tonight's keyword is reef r-e-e-f enter it once more

you guys here in a few minutes [break] myrtlewood it's really pretty ironically well-named captaincupcake (cheering) (pirate voice) we'll get that sent to you right rickety-split having now made your way on the squalleater from as far as i know all of you your first real bit of piracy pulling away the chest that was brought on-board is currently being picked and opened by some members of the crew (thudding) as it folds open looking inside you can see it is a mass of gold silver copper and an occasional glimmer of platinum coins this is quite a bit of change at which point the captain looks over to the quartermaster and goes well done this will be divvied up appropriately what else was found we've got some-- and then begin to point out the food the thawing tropical fruit that was placed there bouldergut's sitting there with the rest of you looking around and listening to the captain looking off into the distance maybe ten feet from you make a deception check the captain glances past and goes eh why don't you stay here at least until we're finished divvying up all the findings you're telling me all right anything else what transpired below you have not told me what happened apparently there was some sort of a scuffle and bouldergut goes (deep chuckle) yeah tiny man in armor you begin to realize at this point not a whole lot of timbre difference between the male and female ogres that you have encountered in your time it's generally just more hair on the top of the head-- stubble's about the same that is impressive did you finish him off i'm impressed you are all very strongly adhering to this not-killing aspect of piracy i can tell you from experience it does not last very long but i respect the intent anything else she looks at you hmm not bad bouldergut leans in right over your shoulder beau and goes what's the-- make a sleight of hand check as you reach back your coins slip from your grasp and (clattering coins) all across-- bouldergut goes (grunts) and starts helping you pick them up but fumbling with her giant fingers indeed avantika gives a keen look towards beau nods yes jester i already have plenty but thank you i appreciate the offer i will keep that under consideration anyway regardless well done impressive work let's continue on to the dragshallow reefs come on you catch up to nott are you going as well or is it just you two that's what i'm asking what are people doing you as well it was very impressive you beat the shit out of that man i could tell that it was very nice well done you too goodbye anyone else doing anything okay you find caleb caleb if you haven't left the top of the deck-- (singing) books and cats and books and cats and books and cats all right you go to your chambers sam and yasha pulls in what is going on no no the full box are you inspecting the full box the box is about shoebox size correct yeah no cousin of the metagaming pigeon the not there imp not there fairy there you go don't forget nott you still have that marble silver shield thing you can take time to do it a few times the shield yeah it does eventually use up the paint over time (laughter) i didn't think this through no in hindsight it occurs to me she would need a surface to paint it on you only had to actually be pirates and fucking roll a ship to get it so live with that goddamn it yeah technically no okay i don't think you-- technically anyone can use a shield but you're not proficient you get a bunch of bad things correct no shields all right i'll have to add it to there myself it's a custom item for any level it's three okay there you go okay you take a little bit you do this little dick and suddenly-- okay and you paint it and finish it and you look at it and take the edge of the paintbrush and nudge it and it rolls a bit (surprised laughter) yeah you're not turning this into second life with all the different fucking floppy dicks flying everywhere you'd have to find out and try no it's +2 and then +1 on top of that hmm i'll double-check that ah there you go make a perception check okay it seems to be fairly clear no in the room you're in currently there is not a port window you know the general vicinity of where it would have happened it would take a little bit of searching and a little bit of-- you know yeah depending on what you have at your disposal like definitely narrow the search but if it's just based on your memory it would take a while to find it but you know the general area where it went down at this point it's later afternoon it's like five or so you're like an hour or two from dusk all right the rest of you go about your business yasha does the same okay how far away are you jester 15 feet make a perception check looking about across the deck you do not see her currently near or visible a few more days' travel to darktow a couple of moments here in one night that you are in your room sketching your book testing out some of your new paints you feel a hand on your shoulder you glance over and you can see the pale soft fingers and a dark greenish sleeve resting there you glance over to the side and you can see the draping hood and the slight curved smile across the angular chin of the traveler protruding from beneath the cloak hello i see you found a new toy well i'm quite excited at the things you're capable of jester how are things surprise me yes my dear yes i've been pleasantly surprised i know your tenacity is impressive maintain that balance that seed of chaos well there are many different enchantments that could achieve the goals you seek trickery listen listen to what piques his interest and then happen to be the source when he needs it if that fails there are plenty of enchantments that can sway his mind i'll do my best no i know so what are you making me i'll wait i'm never far (laughs) what are you making him as you finish painting it it takes gravity it almost seems to fall a centimeter and center itself it goes from a two-dimensional shift it's almost like blinking-- sitting up from the edge of the bed the cloaked figure walks over and lifts it and inspects it and places it back down you're getting better preferably where it would be the least expected and the creepiest to find i'm excited yes make me proud jester the time's coming soon we'll meet the rest of your brethren soon my dear as you look up from your notes closing your book you turn to look and the traveler is gone you guys don't know anything fjord maybe two days out from the reefs you go to bed that night as sleep takes you you find yourself kicking through the thick sludge-like waters that surround you sluggish in your movements the darkness all-encompassing yourself alone in these shadowed depths a faint green light is visible in the distance you push and swim towards it light glowing brighter closer as that grows closer a second light even further impossibly distant but you can acknowledge it rests on the horizon as that first light gets brighter you can see this source taking shape it's a figure female nude also swimming avantika emanating this strange green glow swimming ahead of you her body wreathed in this faint greenish-yellow aura she looks and points to you the waters around you seem to glow the same color light you look down at your body and you see that you are now the third glowing source of this green energy suddenly the waters are easy to traverse what was once sluggish and difficult to fjord is second nature a voice comes through watching the distant light you see suddenly dives with incredible speed nearly out of sight avantika dives down after rocketing down below you breakneck in her speed you dart after her to give chase moving far quicker than you anticipated you realize the water is becoming thinner and thinner like air you're falling three shooting stars plummeting through a dark sky learn glancing down below this endless void you plummet towards you make out the details from a surface rushing towards you you plummet towards an ocean the faint distance endless glittering of moving shifting waves of some sourceless moonlight just barely giving the shapes below with three large masses beneath you like a misshapen triangle of land masses of incongruent sizes one two three you rocket downward towards the space between the three the center of this triangle hitting the waters of the ocean with tremendous force impact but no pain you sink the light of the other two figures glittering through the lightless waters down down you sink until you see a structure coming to view from below a tilted tower wrapped in sea vines the hollow center providing a wide tunnel further within you peer inside this empty tunnel of the tower's depths and watch as a sudden bright yellow light shines from within a gleaming yellow eye reward as the two other lights seem to try and drift towards you behind you you fall into darkness and the dream ends you did you passed south of it your piracy stunt hit right at this trade route there that's where you were the three masses were not even in shape and size and they were clustered at the time from what you recall the ship was heading outward yeah anyway contemplate this in the next few days that pass eventually the fog rolls in and the blue cloudy skies you have become familiar with on this journey give way to gray rainy and cold this marine front rolling in as you begin to come upon the outskirts of the dragshallow reefs okay you do know that the current master gunner is keeping a very close eye on you after you have exhibited-- okay make a sleight of hand check okay you steal over time a pretty decent amount of this powder you're pretty damn proud of it yeah write down on your inventory you have a handful of pepper (laughter) awesome go ahead and roll for that this would be tinker tools yeah with this one it would be yeah dex since you've already made one 15 yeah you manage to construct a pepper arrow pepper bolt there you go the ship skirts around the southern edge of the reefs you can now see the tangled graveyard of destroyed ships and gathered driftwood marking the shallow spots across this jagged cluster of reef curving around a southwestern passage a channel that opens the channel beckons you entry as you turn to head northward to what would be the center the heart of this cluster no more than maybe 20 minutes into entering this channel avantika shouts up at the rest of the crew raise the colors at which point the massive ogre bouldergut tosses the gnomish second mate ipess high up to the central mast to the crow's nest where he swaps out the flag to a new one one that is straight purple as it begins to push its way in make a perception check make a perception check this is a different flag than the one that was raised during piracy natural what okay 14 so what's the total nice okay okay jester it's a couple of things you pick up on the detail of the flag it is straight purple but there is something different about it you're not entirely certain it looks like a straight color but there's sometimes some of the way the light hits it you can see a sheen in parts of it that's the best i can describe the rest of you also look around and you can see amongst these reefs not only are there the jagged bits of it that come forward and bits of rock that jut out the ocean amongst the rest of the rubble around and it looks like a lot of it has been placed both as a communal barricade on top of the reef and as a challenge to anything that wishes to come in but you can see in areas where the rock itself is a little more sturdy and above the surface there are watchtowers and there are bolt-throwers and catapults and there are defenses all across elements of this reef that you imagine are one of the many reasons it's not been taken back by the clovis concord in what you would know to be the 40-plus years that darktow has belonged to what is known as the revelry the revelry is the communal band of pirates that work together to maintain some internal order make a history check fjord and anybody else proficient with history okay okay fjord and caleb you know that this began as a dispute with the heads of the guilds in the clovis concord they own and run a majority of the trade routes that come in and out but a lot of the smaller shipping businesses and various other side-industry leaders were being over-taxed repeatedly in an attempt to close them out of the business and essentially completely own all means of shipping in the vicinity this pissed off a lot of people and eventually in moments of combined desperation and frustration they banded together and where darktow was previously a very important repair and stopping station this far out from the menagerie coast for long-distance shipping they ransacked it and took it over they killed those that defended themselves and any of those who did not want to raise arms would be absorbed and be allowed to become a member of what was now called the revelry as such they have since held this location and continued to be the source of piracy both for their own wealth and continuation of well-being but also as a continuous source of aggression and destruction of the otherwise very prosperous trade that the clovis concord runs you do know also that the revelry is run by what's called the plank king the previous one was killed 15 years ago by the current plank king who challenged him the plank king is known as wyatt marinas and all you have heard is he is a giant of a man as you move deeper through this channel the day goes on begins to get somewhat dark as you begin to see the glittering lights of the southern edge of darktow isle the cold pulls through and a light rain begins to fall as you approach this island unlike the jungle islands that you've come across and a vast majority of the swavain islands here off the menagerie coast is mostly rock and cliff in fact from what you can see most of this island from this perspective is jagged cliff face and probably a few hundred feet up is where the island's even surface even begins at the base around this cliff face you can see a scattered web of a shipyard just tangled docks that maneuver around containing dozens and dozens of ships across that you see numerous torches that mark various intersections where they all meet and built into the base of this cliff face you see a number of buildings and windows all slowly being lit as the night grows darker and darker this mass of natural-looking hive-like pirate city there stands before you welcome to darktow as the ship makes its way to the docks and eventually comes to a stop you can see a few figures up there at the edge one of them that rings a bell as it comes in and a couple that come out to meet avantika steps out and there's a couple of hands raised and go hail avantika she goes we have returned i know it has been quite a while but success and celebration i believe are on our lips tonight a few of the men come up and look over the crew and look over a few of you and take some notes and then dart off the ship now has docked they're beginning to take remains of the supplies the mistake is pulled off onto the other side and orly and your other hired crew are looking very wide-eyed and confused about what the fuck is going on you literally hired a bunch of guys out of-- nicodranas that have now been brought into a-- yep as you begin to step off the ship-- jamedi steps off with the rest of you looks to avantika and goes up to her and goes you still owe me 50 more gold i counted what you gave me she goes oh my apologies i thought i had correctly counted that she pulls a few coins out of her purse and hands it to him counts it himself our business is concluded looks to the rest of you be careful around this one be safe he turns and walks into the city it is salty with sea splash and cold to the touch because of the nature of the stone no one talked to him over the journey there was a lot of back and forth over the journey avantika turns to the rest crew it has been a good journey you have all been very kind you have been resolute and uk'otoa will be proud laura and tonight we drink come let us be off to the bloated cup the rounds are on me sam and marius comes around the edge of the-- of the docks yes remember marius yes he's like okay don't mean to make this really-- where the fuck are we okay (nervous sighing) both really what should it be got it oh there's more lepual lepain orly's big turtle hand clasps on the back of your left shoulder beau and goes oh i kind of like that one well i like juice (unsure uncomfortable humming) wait what i'm going to need a drink the rest of the crew looking confused amongst themselves stick together and they come over one of them his name would've been-- oh actually no at this point this is gallan gallan who has recovered and is-- yes who has become loosely the-- because he's the only one who was originally on the mist and knows it well-- he's become the den mother of the other hired crew you've brought into this wiley adventure he comes up and goes so all these ones what's the plan i'll ask around he doesn't seem bothered by it he's been here before gallan left this port on the mist but he seems genuinely-- over the travel he's gotten a little bit concerned and seems somewhat invested in the new crew you've hired he goes and relays that message to the rest of them in the meantime the rest of the crew seems to have followed suit with avantika leaving a few crewmen that are just a part of the docks to keep watch pretty damn well patrolled and monitored this is the bread and butter of their business you get the sense here and based on your history checks everyone who resides in darktow is a member of the revelry by the way you guys are members of the revelry well by becoming part of avantika's crew coming into port and having a few individuals mark your presence you imagine that's probably the case well what are you guys doing it's more the former than the latter from the first part there is no uniformed guard there is no-- yeah the heavy realm of piracy has only existed for 40-plus years on this coast it's still in some ways finding its footing winding through the docks following the rest of avantika's crew the docks and bridges it's this labyrinth to find your way beyond that to the stone and rock where you had kissed earlier the city itself is a series of switchback paths and carved caverns and cave entrances that have since been outfitted with pieces of wood with windows now at this point it's pretty much pitch black in the sky what little bit of light there is from the nearby torch and lantern light gives just a hint of the mist that's rolled in across the outskirts of the island the only light sources you have are those you keep on you or the distant glowing smattering of hundreds of fire-lit windows lit from the inside the warm buildings that make up the city as you make your way to what you assume to be the tavern the bloated cup if you will avantika's currently standing outside talking to somebody there you see this burly rough-looking human man probably a week and a half unshaven this thick five o'clock shadow grayish curled hair that goes right about shoulder-length it's slicked back probably with his fingers to one side but it's oily enough where it stays in place looks like he's wearing an officious coat and they're currently in the middle of a discussion and she looks over her shoulder to the rest of you and goes ah my apologies there is one bit of business we must attend to before we can celebrate the rest of you continue on my new compatriots it seems and the human figure pipes up and goes word has reached the ears of the plank king that you've brought new blood here to darktow i imagine these are the new blood based on and he looks at a sheet of paper that's handed to him and looks at the description that was written and he would appreciate you bringing them to the throne roost and have an audience well i'm the assistant of the plank king james tybalt i'm certain he wouldn't argue he smiles now this is the first time you've seen his grin and there's maybe six or seven teeth most of them are blackening i'd recommend y'all follow me you too avantika he wants to check in she sighs but gives a smile ipess bring like 500 he starts counting out gold from one of the chests they had brought with them no that's what quartermasters do it's all good the coin is passed over to a smaller chest and avantika carries it up under her arm you guys are led to the western side of this city and then begin climbing up this precarious set of winding stairs carved out of the rocky cliff above the city slick with mist and recent rain it looks like the way the wind's hitting the rain isn't hitting the cliff side but you can see it passing maybe 15 20 feet in front of you partway up this climb the occasional torch is now replaced with a wooden pike holding a skull or a head at varying stages of decay okay you put your metal scary mask on you're led up further maybe 250 300 feet up this cliff face leading you with some of the bursts of wind to lean against it to pull across the stone stairs themselves vary from two feet wide to maybe a foot at times looking down over the edge you can imagine a few folks have found their end with an odd misstep the stairs finally stop at a wide stone shelf that overlooks the town at about 200 to 300 feet above the furthermost edge ending just above the rocky waters of the inlet a cave mouth greets you against the cliff warm with firelight two watchmen notice you and they stand there keeping an eye as a cloaked man pushes past you to descend from where you came he just pushes past you avantika nods to the guards and shows the chest he's a little ways past you now make a perception check it's too dark and there's too much rain it's hard to make out any details unfortunately avantika continues in after showing the chest the offering the rest of you follow as you follow inside the smell of fine cooked meats and sauces mingles with wet leather and stagnant water a soft fiddle and squeezebox duet dances through the evening air the bardic sources atop stools next to a large stone chair carved from the surrounding rock sitting atop the throne is a giant of a man half giant to be precise his dull gray skin marked with scars his coat long and velvet blue tattered at the edges plain breeches and boots shift as he stands his eyes cold shifting with his smile long black curls toppling along the sides of his head past his shoulders framing his face to about mid chest now you know this through your research and some of you had experiences for the most part male goliaths don't have hair let alone such luxurious locks as he stands up a servant enters and leaves a bowl of somewhat bruised feet-- somewhat bruised fruit at the feet of the throne the large figure claps his hands once loudly and the music stops coming to a halt deep guests avantika you bring guests welcome friends to the revelry come sit a spell two servants all of a sudden come behind you hear the scraping of wood against stone as two long benches are pressed behind you you find yourself awkwardly having to sit on them as they creak with your weight another bowl of nuts and somewhat mushy berries is placed in caduceus' hands a bottle of wine is opened and handed to caleb my manners where are they (chuckles) i am wyatt marinas the plank king of darktow master of the revelry and you are sets it awkwardly on one of the arms of the stone throne okay gilligan so avantika it seems you took all of these under your wing she nods and takes her chest and puts it forward and goes that is true and i believe the rest will introduce themselves here in another moment (grunt of acknowledgement) yasha just goes i'm yasha well you've all come under the banner of the squalleater what draws you to a life of piracy what drives you all right looks to yasha i like to punch things kind of smiles looks back over his shoulder you've got all that linus and you see off to the side in an alcove you weren't looking you see a man hunched over who's currently writing everything down in a book and sketching and he's paying really close attention to everybody and is listening yeah no (laughter) he's feverishly taking notes and sketching you recognize he's drawing as well as making notes okay well if the captain here vouches for you then i trust you won't go causing any trouble only law here is no trouble coming between pirates while within the reef you cause trouble on land i judge you you've seen a few judged on your way up here trouble outside the reef well you'll either return to explain your cases and i decide what's fair or in need of punishment or if you don't return i just assume you're guilty them's the big ones you understand depends on what the other one thinks if the other one doesn't want to be harmed or stolen from well that's breaking the law well hard for me to hear that you broke it now darktow means protection means family and family shares its good fortune he looks to avantika and she now kicks the chest across and scrapes he stops it with his foot and kicks open the lid and the coins are there now visible a couple spilling out i accept your tribute welcome back we'll get your ships up and fixed real soon welcome to the revelry (laughs) (uneasy laughter) a damn dream-chaser she be so be warned where she leads you she's crazy fucking nuts she looks up at him and goes you are quite the peach yourself there master squints to himself well thanks that's it shove off get the fuck out of my room yes he's glaring over at you of course no i have my drinks brought up here as avantika leaves the rest of you are leaving takes his arms and pushes you out leading you to the exit make a perception check 17 couple of things you notice one you glance in the vicinity you look and notice the plank king right where the hairline is it's a duller paler white in that moment you remember the first plank king was definitely known for his longer darker locks (groaning) looking around the interior of the chamber because the way this is carved inside the mountain it's this nice arched cavern top and there are number of alcoves and hidden spaces and you glance around it and first at just a quick glance notice at least six or seven other figures that are hidden in the alcoves just watching figures seem to be either human or-- as you're all being ushered out of the chamber and pushed to the side the plank king is like anyway off with you enjoy your night drink well we'll take care of that and there's a little tug on your arm beau the plank king comes and whispers in the side of your ear he says you've a keen ear right avantika ever does anything untoward to our little community here you let me know there's some grand coin in it for you just backs away okay with that you make your way out back to the stone steps avantika sees you all exit and goes well that was harrowing and necessary but over now for drinking yes he's certainly a series of adjectives yes i'll give you that well over a decade probably oh well it's not paying him to not kill us it's sharing in our spoils to better the community i don't know i've never tried nevertheless i'm going to get drunk who's with me all right come on she smiles and turns around and you all begin to make your trek down the somewhat slick stone steps to the darkened city of darktow the glittering firelight the open windows below leading you to whatever revelry the evening has in store and that's where we'll pick up next week you a stole a ship and followed the path it is a point of comparison this is true well guys this is a very unique flavor of campaign he's a fun one on that note folks we're going to pick this up next thursday look forward to the art book coming on sale monday morning the final chapters the second half and end of vox machina's campaign as created and presented by you the fantastic art community yeah other than that have a wonderful weekend we love you and is it thursday yet goodnight guys (wolf whistle)
