hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play dungeons & dragons so welcome i know we had a two-week hiatus we had some birthdays-- in fact the twins had a birthday (cheering) yes it did yes it did no so starting off our announcements for the evening first off i am going to be flying out bright and early tomorrow

mary and steve are there also so don't choose come to both no exactly but i'll be doing signings panels and meeting a bunch of you critters that are out in that area so come by and say hi this weekend and if not go say hi to steve and mary wherever that happens in the lesser part of dallas i don't know if it is i just like-- where are your dice travis is going to get them wow two weeks to stew on this and it's already falling apart while he looks for those-- i do want to also say the newest dear abby article series for critical role characters went up-- or goes up tomorrow right friday and whose is that one the next dear abby oh then we'll have vex tomorrow coming up see her answering questions to various distraught people throughout the realms of exandria and her i'm sure very astute-- possibly this is very true so look for that tomorrow on geekandsundrycom that'll be fun and exciting also for those who didn't catch it yesterday we had an awesome event at meltdown comics with the official dungeons & dragons crew announcing one their new storyline which is the storm king's thunder i think is what it's called really awesome bringing the giants back into the world with a very fleshed-out story i'm super excited about it and keep tabs on that whenever that comes out should be in the next few months i think i've seen some stuff behind-the-scenes and it looks really really cool but as part of that event yesterday we also kicked off and announced a new video series campaign that i'm doing with the actual wizards of the coast dungeons & dragons team me and chris perkins wrote and designed together a story that i fleshed out and am running for a series of celebrity guests one of which is our fantastic ashley johnson there that was pretty great guys i'm not going to lie that was pretty legit that's right we're waiting on scanlan to get here other guests include utkarsh shelby jonah-- i wrote all the first names down because the last names some of them were hard to pronounce but you can look up the actual announcements to get the full names i'm really bad at this it's been two weeks give me a break nah i've got so much free time but it's going to be a great group and i look forward to announcing it soon on when those will begin to air throughout the summer because it's going to be a lot of fun and i get to play in forgotten realms which is something i've wanted to do again for a long time and hope i don't mess up all the existing fantastic lore that ed greenwood has developed since he-- oh are you okay laura you want to jump into that yeah so we have a new sponsor coming in sponsoring this episode of critical role this evening (cheering) well please continue we're not stopping you please go ahead you did good sam you did good it's been cool having sponsors come to the show partially because they all come to us from being fans of the actual show and that's the driving force behind this so we want to make sure that things are on-brand from people who are genuinely interested in our community and have things to offer that'll be useful i can say this as i have a web series i directed many years ago and spent a whole year doing i lost all the files because of the hard drive that i had-- the external hard drive failed and i don't have any of those anymore and so since then i've been very very careful about backing everything up so this service would have been really helpful back then so don't make the same mistakes i did there will be brawl only lives as final video files it kills me i couldn't even fix stuff still have the watermark on the last three videos for the escapist that i can't remove anyway learn from my mistakes so do we have anything else any of you folks want to announce e3 is next week no it's two weeks from now i believe nothing coming out of that mouth now all right great so without further ado and no further delaying the inevitable-- little thing on my nose right there no it's great so let's go ahead and roll the intro and start playing critical role [dramatic music] tiny vax thanks to a potion that does that you managed to go ahead and put in an immovable rod within its stomach which held it up for a moment before it decided to truly gain the advantage it needed to escape the circumstance allowed it to tear through its body as well as an arrow that was shot by vex towards her brother in hopes of-- i don't know being a signal of hope or to put him out of his misery i'm still trying to figure it out at this point in time umbrasyl took to the sky and began to coast off towards gatshadow seemingly the domain that it's carved for itself in this region on its way out grog had thrown his newly acquired bloodaxe and his chain of returning into the dragon left it and is now being dragged behind it now dangling as it flies off and that my friends is where we kick back into the story so we have as you guys-- grog your feet leave the ground as you swing forward unable by the momentum pushing forward to keep up with the sheer speed of this dragon and its size its mass its full stretched wings it is far faster than any of you expected and it whooshes off towards the mountaintop you just looking behind as the ground just fades further and further away the rest of you vox machina seeing this happen see essentially half of your friends your party only one of them visible now beyond your reach with that being said for this circumstance let's pick up where we were on the initiative order between you three yeah we left at the right time for that guys here how about this because i can't find the original initiative order we'll just say for this circumstance we'll roll initiative based on what action's going to happen here so we're going to have you three roll initiative all right so as it crests into the sky (whoosh) blackish dragon blood dripping from wounds you can feel every single tension of its upper torso muscles with each swoop of the wings crushing against you in this rhythmic pattern what little bit of air currently has been placed at the top of the stomach based on your thunderwave is all you have to maintain any semblance of hope you there's an arrow in darkness however umbrasyl at this point who does go first in this order is just concentrating on survival and continues gliding upward you hear a rumble within the inside of the body and the essence of a growling angry voice creeps through these foul creatures get out of me (straining sound) i need you guys to both roll strength saving throws right now 15 you manage to put your arms against the side and using whatever forceful arcane cantrips to keep the walls at bay before it actually finds you and you slip out in time you however do suffer six points of bludgeoning damage as the muscles once again tense against you umbrasyl is very much aware that there are now living things inside the stomach squirming around and as the muscles relax the voice just growls again try all you want don't worry i can eat you now or later so we had two 13s and a-- 12 all right so grog vax what are you guys doing the bramblewood is now beneath you you're heading towards the mountain you can see the edge of the forest now you can see it curving up ahead of you and with how high the sun is in the sky it's around noon there's a heavy bit of shadow and at this distance make a perception check 13 it seems to be somewhere around the base of the tail like where the tail meets the rest of the actual body itself the torso area no it's not quite in his butt it's more in his side looking down numbers are hard for you to pick up it's a long way it's a long way like-- yeah all right go ahead and make an athletics check athletics which is better technically yeah it's strength plus your proficiency bonus you get your proficiency bonus you're no longer raging because this is more fear-struck at this point 19 yeah you begin to ascend the chain you get closer to it and you can now see the axe itself is embedded and is starting to wiggle and pull out so you're making your way up the chain with the full round at this point you're almost to it but that's going to be the rest of your action this turn so what are you doing okay the arrowhead is still poking through-- okay okay all right go ahead and make a general dexterity check to see if you're able to-- okay using the essence of where the actual shaft of the arrow has pierced the hide and is stuck through you take the blade and use your understanding of precision weapons and implements to find the slight opening and the blade thankfully is very thin slide it through with minimal resistance you can see the muscles are still pushing against it but the already preset wound from the arrow does guide it through and you manage to go straight to the hilt and it's found its way all the way through the wound no additional damage is dealt necessarily but it has gone-- you said you wanted to put it through an existing hole yeah do you want to roll an attack for this right now you would make the attack as the blade the idea being that you wanted to guide it through the hole didn't you use any luck for the battle right so you have two left plus one yeah and then it does additional damage against dragons okay this roll will be at disadvantage right right right go ahead and make the secondary attack yeah okay so the blade is in there and it has found its way through the existing wound but you don't quite have the strength to actually wrench it enough to do any real serious damage as it is a very very hardy and well-defended creature from its natural mass the fleshy interior of a dragon is almost as dense and as protected as the armored hide on the outside and that's one thing you weren't counting on when entering its form you've put the blade through the hole and so now you have that blade lodged in you can then use that to try and widen it in successive turns in itself and that will prevent you from having disadvantage on the attacks with that blade going forward because it's already in a soft place and you can just wedge it but it's going to be a strength attack for each of those rounds the dagger unfortunately you just can't find any purchase at that point there in the time given because of the movement and the squishing you do also suffer an additional seven points of crushing damage you are in the most difficult terrain there probably is pushing towards the wound okay i would say that would be part of your attack next round actual movement within you would be able to move a few feet but you'd have to release the blade to do so any actual blade pushing forward would be your next action so hold off for the next round scanlan what you got this is true it was very small it's the equivalent of a bullet going through because the rod when it punched through it didn't-- it's a very thin elongated object so it pierced through like a metal rod at a very high speed if it would have hit-- at whatever angle it would be even then it's only that wide and it would still puncture a tiny slit and due to the density of both the muscles of the creature and its body it took damage and there's a little bit of blood coming from the wound you imagine but it's not like it's going to leave an open cavernous hole yeah it's a cut but you did see where it (tearing noise) through you just saw it (tearing noise) through the creature's stomach you do see a little bit of blood beginning to pour out of where the wound was okay okay well before that happens you do take four points of acid damage from the stomach before you take the form because that would be the top of the round so at which point you turn into a small poisonous snake now floating amongst the acids and find your way along the surface and you're heading towards the wound okay all right-- right you do (laughter) through the acid it's swimming once you get to the actual wound this is more squeezing and that's going to be more of a strength-based element so that being the case here a poisonous snake i'm going to need you to go ahead and roll a strength check to push against the wound which just as a heads up is a minus four to its strength so that's technically a negative three yeah you just dive in headfirst and with all your snaky might you slither and slither and slither just getting nowhere no headway this is bad (laughter) sure go for it roll for an attack plus five a 19 the inside of the stomach is not as well-armored as outer parts of the body a 19 would hit go ahead and roll damage this would be-- oh no you don't roll it takes one piercing damage (laughter) and it has to make a constitution saving throw versus your poison that's an eight plus 14 at a dc of ten so yeah it doesn't take any additional-- oh it takes half damage so go ahead and roll 2d4 it takes three points of poison damage (laughter) all right top of the round okay so umbrasyl is still flying up looking down at its form is glancing about grog as you're holding onto the axe you see before you just pass underneath the leg and the front arms that are reaching down this giant dark looming projection comes down and looks right towards you the horned front of the dragon as umbrasyl stares right into your face and goes there you are (draws in breath exhales) and unleashes a torrent of acid towards you i need you to go ahead and make-- this is going to roll a dexterity saving throw you have disadvantage because you're currently holding onto the chain but i believe you have advantage on them because you are a barbarian yeah so just roll no they are way over-- they're like a tiny little dragon speck in the distance we'll get to you guys here in just a moment but their situation is a little more dire and immediate so i have to figure out what's going on with them right now you can if you want to did you want to go after them laura and okay we'll get to that in just a minute as it is-- the dragon's speed is it can fly 80 feet per round yeah and it's making double-dash manoeuvring here even at your fly speed on the broom-- let's check that real fast giant eagles-- 80 feet so the eagles are able to keep up do you want something that way first off grog you take 62 points of acid damage she took damage and it dropped so as the stream pours past you you feel your flesh burning and elements of your skin are actually sloughing off and plummeting beneath you like a thick oatmeal you still maintain your grip on the axe through sheer force of anger and willpower umbrasyl slows down a little bit in not doing the double-dash maneuver that's going to end umbrasyl's turn so you sent the eagles after-- so the eagles swing by-- okay so you retrieve the rod grab it and head off in that direction so we now have both of you on eagle-back heading off with you trailing behind as you can't quite travel at the same speed as the eagles okay keyleth what are you doing go for it yeah bad news is out all right as you're flying off you're having a hard time with the bumpy ride as this eagle also has been near death due to being partially dissolved by the acidic attack from the dragon before it wasn't the acid it was something else that wrecked it yeah i think it was a bite or a claw because the acid would've destroyed it so the eagle's heavily wounded and due to it shuddering and trying to keep up it just causes you to end up bending a portion of the actual weapon all right so you guys are keeping up you're concentrating on the stone bringing us back now grog you're recovering from this attack do recall you do have one point of exhaustion since your frenzied rage did wear off beforehand so you go into a rage it doesn't help with that no okay athletics check with advantage you find your way up grabbing onto the edge of the tail and you actually pull yourself up onto the base of the tail you're on the back of umbrasyl right now the chain is still currently attached to its side it's taken your whole turn to really get up there are you going to dislodge the bloodaxe or leave it there okay so go ahead and make your check to remove it it's a dc 12 i think you pull on the chain but the reason it managed to hold your weight this whole ride up was it was wedged pretty well into its armored hide and thank god it did however at this point it's proving that that is now coming back to haunt you as it is really hard to pull it from where it's stuck in the dragon that's going to be the end of your turn vax go for it correct i'm letting this one be a finesse 25 you carve an opening in the side about a foot and a half in full length there as you drag it you hear a roaring go ahead and roll damage on that 16 all righty this is less rules and more narrative you don't understand the body or where you really are in the body of the dragon he's not threatening the creature right now if anything it's potentially threatening you this would not be a sneak attack no worries i'd say yes because the only reason you didn't have disadvantage with the other blade is because it was within an existing wound and then you pulled back okay the other dagger you go ahead and stab again this time it hits a dense part of muscle and does sink in but not enough to do any serious damage from the inside a little bit yes it's about that wide you staying there yeah go ahead and make a straight strength check 13 that's fine thankfully the dc's lower because you managed to carve the large wound in you plant your feet against the other muscle wall that you are between and you push off and get yourself through and in the most awkward tiny birth just above your armpits your head and arm emerge out the side immediately a gust of wind hits your hand as you realize and look down you are hundreds of feet above the ground bramblewood right beneath you but you are partially out of the dragon take a deep breath you take three points of crushing damage as the muscle walls around you are still squeezing in on you in your current placement that ends your turn you at the top of your round your snake takes acid damage only one point of acid damage how many hit points does your poisonous snake have it may have less than one hit point in which case you're just going to turn right back into scanlan let's find out it has two hit points that was before you transformed it was at the top of your round no you just let it go it was a good idea just not a very strong snake okay so using that little pocket of air you bring your hand up you do your quick somatic components shouting the phrase and bigby's hand appears and is currently being squished between some of the walls of the stomach yeah i don't-- yeah (laughter) this would be a very forceful hand this would be the definition of bigby's forceful hand go ahead and roll an athletics check for bigby which is strength 28 so add plus eight to the roll total of 12 the finger pushes partway in and gets about halfway up to its second knuckle (laughter) i'm blushing man all right that's your turn you do have movement yes you can move your arms yeah okay make a strength check six you take it and (ting swish) it just slips along the very heavy mucous material lined interior of the stomach there's a little scrape line but that's about it top of umbrasyl's round breath weapon does not return however is going to use one of its legendary actions and attempt to beat its wings to shake you off of it grog i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw 18 you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage which is reduced by half so you're only taking seven however you are knocked prone yes which causes you to begin tumbling off the back of the tail the wind of it-- (thump thump) the chain of returning is still attached to you however and as you go tumbling off the back of the tail it catches you and you are now swinging towards the back of the creature of the dragon now back where you started only the dragon is very aware of your presence but you didn't plummet to your death that was the end of your turn now it's the top of umbrasyl's turn yeah imagine that at this point now as this has gone on for a little while as you guys began to ascend and it went upward it's now partway up the mountainside you can see the forest has gotten more sparse there are trees scattered across the top of the mountaintop you can see it you're not there but it's going across the forest top and it's coming towards the actual mountain base it hasn't quite ascended it completely they're keeping in tandem with it they're not able to quite catch up entirely just due to the nature of the fast dragon not for her unfortunately no you at this point jumping on would just be on the outside of the range if you wanted to try you're at disadvantage on these attacks because you are on the back of a flying wounded bird with disadvantage that hits go ahead and roll damage you lost hex yeah gun goes off you hear a whizz go by your ear as the bullet hits the side of umbrasyl (grunting) the head looks back towards the rest of you now approaching at a distance so at the top of umbrasyl's turn as you guys are pushing forward and you're still concentrating the dragon growls under its breath (spellcasting) you can't hear it you're too far away the outer view of the dragon shimmers for a second and then vanishes from sight no yeah you see the dragon grog is dangling from nothing right now grog is kiting through the air in theory yeah if you can keep a bead on him a very heavy grog he would be you haven't taken a lot of damage yet or at all then you still have hunter's mark on him yeah continues upward that comes to the next part grog you're up that has gone away unfortunately make an athletics check 15 all righty you manage to pull yourself halfway up the chain you get back to where you were towards the base of the tail that's the extent of your round there the wind resistance itself you can see the axe itself after you tried to tug it forward did bring it a little loose so its position is still a little precarious all right vax it would be part of the attack to draw it out and attack it wouldn't use your movement it would be part of the attack to draw it out and attack with it it wouldn't use your movement okay you're in a weird position now where the blade's at your side so pulling away from the body there's very little strength to pull that way since you punched through the wound so you're essentially holding the blade right here you'd be at a disadvantage on it go for it 15 there's just not enough strength to get it though you try and pull upward and the blade comes loose comes towards your body but doesn't actually find any additional part of the muscle to cut through 21 just scrapes across the hide not strong enough to pierce it from the outside you do also take one point of bludgeoning damage as the wound tenses around you once more scanlan roll an athletics check with plus eight 20 the hand pushes into the wound causing it to tear open and rupture part of the stomach as it punches through temporarily leaving an open wound in the side of its stomach area bigby's hand is partially outside the dragon now it takes 11 points of damage from the wound and you currently have a little bit of light that's visible before the wound closes the muscles re-tense you watch it punch through and everything (gasp) it's the moment of impact you leap in after bigby's hand just in the wake of it slamming into the side of the muscle of the stomach walls in that one moment you're rushing past you can feel the actual muscles tensing behind you go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw 18 okay you manage to leap behind bigby's hand and grab onto the side of it as the hand punches entirely out of the dragon's body the wound slamming shut behind you are now outside the dragon holding onto bigby's hand he is flying bigby's hand bigby's hand can move up to 60 feet so no it's slower than the dragon starting to drag a little bit behind as it's moving no that was its action that's most of your turn really at this point that was your movement to push through after the bonus attack so you have your action i'll give you your action you have an action so you could technically you look out as you punch through you look down below you suddenly after you take a moment to look and you can see part of vax emerging from the side of the dragon and then the whole dragon and vax vanish you do see grog dangling from the chain slowly pulling his way up towards the back you are now right there with bigby's hand (laughter) not this turn no okay all right advantage on the dexterity saving throw what's the dc of it the dc of the lightning bolt nope you are clutching both hands onto the side 18 it makes the save roll damage and it takes half damage 26 all right so it takes 13 points of lightning damage (blast) the bolt streaks upward hitting the sides of the wound that you just came out of it and arcs up the side of the body most of it is absorbed from the hefty scaled hide of the black dragon but it does (unhappy groan) roil with pain you hear it yelling and with a very slight shifting of light you notice the dragon is still there and you recognize this this is an invisibility spell that ends your turn so the rest of you guys trying to keep up the dragon's far out of range of anything you have and it's just seems to be coasting as fast as it can out of the way so you have nothing i don't think that can really go past a 300 400 foot range so you're just keeping on that eagle holding on you as well you're behind the others just slowly falling behind i think it's 50 feet i can look it up again real fast it's not a racing broom quidditch broom i'll find it for you i'm going to look it up right now just to let you know so we can all relax i gather that (laughter) back to the top of the round the dragon umbrasyl now (wings flapping) even you are being dragged behind nothing you can hear the wings beating you still have full sight of the dragon at this point the voice growls out of its throat fine let's see how well you hold on insects it begins to spin and do a barrel roll i need both of you as also its muscles tense to roll strength saving throws six 26 you get swung around the chain taking the brunt of all the weight across its back (popping) comes free thankfully you were in an up arc but you are now arcing in the air you also get ejected from the wound from the muscles tensing behind it almost squeezes you out before you can even get a grapple on the dragon vanishes from sight and you're now falling backwards okay as you emerge from the body of umbrasyl there is a streak of shadow that scatters into a burst of darkened raven feathers that fill the air around you you still plummet but as a nature of your prayer that brief moment of understanding it appears there is some reaction that'll be that element there oh you're like 20 seconds in 30 seconds in you guys now watch as suddenly grog and vax just (rush of air) vax appears out of nowhere and is falling scanlan's being held aloft by a distant bigby's hand and grog is arcing in the air at that point now grog vax what are you doing as you're falling backward (air puffs) yeah it's like 25 cent quality above you grog as you squeeze your eyes and hold on plummeting down towards the bramblewood vax i believe it's an action 23 does hit yeah it makes it it would've had to roll a one to not make it unfortunately sure make a perception check just glancing around you four no you see earth beneath you sky above mountain to your left and the inevitable plummet coming at you vax is about 20 feet from you grog's about 60 70 feet from you the dragon's moved ahead to this point now since you guys have fallen off grog is vax is a little bit below you he's trying he's holding a scrap piece of fabric that's just (rustling fabric) right now you could catch up to one of them yeah grog is in an arc so you would have to meet him as he fell okay so you clutch onto bigby's hand and move as he plummets what are you doing what are you doing scanlan okay the hand comes forward sends out this cupping motion the fingers below you eyes closed clenching tight (impact) all of a sudden the wind stops and it's like you're being held by your mother again a memory you haven't recalled since you were a child you open your eyes slowly and you're still above the ground holy shit but there's a giant purple hand around you and a very freaked out scanlan clutching the outside that was the turn to even get to him and catch him you still have an action if you have anything no you have a vague idea of where it might be that's useful okay so as you look over at scanlan with a big look of relief and thank you he gives you a cursory look as the hand vanishes he grabs you real fast and suddenly you have feathers what the shit and strangely you become smarter as giant eagles have an intelligence of eight it's a beautiful mind moment in the middle of the sky suddenly you understand the instinct hits you and (whoosh) you have wings you feel scanlan's tiny hands grasping the back of your neck all right you guys start seeing this happen in the distance and a little sparkle of hope hits you whatever it may be coming back around to the top umbrasyl is taking a double dash motion he's past grog it's your turn you do and it is a perpetual flurry they're coming out of nowhere it is this long visual line of black feathers that are being tossed from beneath vax's flapping cape there's just heavy feathers and digging in so as you go into a full dive that's 80 speed that's 160 feet (whoosh) you manage to just crest underneath the plummeting vax the trail of black feathers trailed by a long line of brown feathers being plucked out from scanlan feverishly trying to grab onto your back for some sort of purchase pain you deal with pain all the time it doesn't dissolve your focus vax i need you to go ahead and attempt to grab onto the eagle as it swoops beneath you go ahead and make a single strength saving throw this is the time to use it as the eagle swoops underneath you you reach out you don't even see it you're looking up into the sky as you plummet the trail of feathers going past as you concentrate on the acceptance you've made to the raven queen and the understanding that perhaps if there is a chance to survive let it be through this leap of faith you've taken in the direction of an entity that you've been so fearful of and scoffed at since she came to you in your dreams a moment you see the feathers begin to trail off and subside from beneath your cloak and a voice whispers in your ear and says left without thinking your hand reaches out without even seeing and you (impact) grab the edge of scanlan's cloak as you're dragged behind you (choking) from behind you can barely breathe as the eagle swoops up you can feel the heartbeat the blood flowing in the back of your head your ears hot (heartbeat) as you slowly reach over and grab the back of the eagle is this keyleth you don't know all you know is scanlan swooped in and in this moment of need seemingly a prayer was answered so what are you guys doing yeah he's tiny that's the only reason i'm not having him tear you off the back of the eagle because of the size okay you guys see this in the distance as now the eagle captures the falling vax and then begins to head down towards the base of the mountain where the bramblewood meets okay you guys make your way downward towards the bottom keyleth you finish your concentration on the stone (whoosh) suddenly you step through being pushed through a tunnel of blue light and energy and for a moment all you see before you is vax's face his tiny little raven-sized face (whoosh) as you guys watch keyleth apparate right in front of vax and go speeding past you as she's now plummeting from the air having summoned to your side you're still earth elemental so yeah you see keyleth as a giant boulder that appears at the side you have to dodge out of the way (whoosh) as this giant rock being out of the corner of your eye appears before you however she sinks straight past you you're flying as low as you can you're going terminal velocity and there is this (rumble) rock entity plummeting at the same rate yeah i know it was at about 200 feet up you continue to plummet all right you're not doing anything else you're going to take the fall the very edge of the bramblewood and the base of the mountain you're not quite sure where you'll land you see treetops and rocks and then the rest of the damage would carry over that's 20d6 all right so you're going to take it all right you guys watch as the earth elemental curls up forms this streak of flame and smoke behind and now a plummeting keyleth meteor goes slamming into the base of the mountain just past you as you pull up from impacting at terminal velocity you suffer 76 points of bludgeoning damage upon impact (boom) this giant crater is left around your form as now there is this somewhat smoke-swirled keyleth sprawled out in the center of this the rest of you all eventually catch up the eagle-back carriers you on broomback finding your party bruised hurt but ultimately survived this moment of the encounter as you've all had this moment to yourself vex you hear a noise to your left coming from the exterior of the bramblewood you glance off to the side and you can see emerging slowly from the forest a single humanoid standing before you no you see slowly coming forward a woman an older woman an older goliath woman missing one eye and missing her forearm-- her left arm right at the elbow the right arm clutches a very tall quarterstaff that is being used as a walking stick as she wanders up you can see dirt smeared in her face darker dreadlocks pulled tight against the back of the head that dangle past the shoulders tattoos similar to the ones that adorn grog across the face and shoulders she slowly walks towards the party let's go ahead and bring our guest for the evening out you can go around the other way let's welcome chris perkins right to the edge next to you keyleth as she steps up and emerges from the forest everyone turns and sees the worry on vex's face you do actually not very well shale has been around longer than you have as part of the herd but is mostly considered past her prime as a warrior since she lost her arm was set to the side and a lot of the herd seems to not value their elders when they become less powerful in battle but even still she carries a bit of spit and vinegar to her but it's been a while since you've seen her and to see her surviving out here both curious and honorable (caw) shale's holding her staff out which caught your attention the large crashing boom how long does the potion last yeah three hours it's a sizable climb gatshadow-- while this portion is the south part of the cliffkeep mountains which get higher the further north you go this mountain is called gatshadow because it is dark and ominous and stands out amongst the rest of the mountains while the other ones crest at about maybe 4000 feet up this one's nearly a mile a little over a mile high there are sparse trees most of them dead or dried out towards the top but other than that the vegetation is pretty sparse since you guys landed here it's probably been about two three minutes even at your fastest pace eagle speed the broom is slower than the eagles eagle speed you're looking at about-- i'm estimating somewhere between ten to 20 minutes you would know being as dragons are your favored enemy and you have information on that generally they don't-- they themselves can recover over time and if given a full day or so they can largely recover from the wounds they have sustained almost entirely especially a dragon as powerful as an ancient you would know that because they understand and fear their demise or at least are arrogant enough to think it's not possible they will have certain reserves to try and help them recover if they ever find themselves in a dire circumstance occasionally depending on the intelligence of the dragon and what resources it has at its disposal some semblance of healing magic items they may have acquired that can help the longer you wait the more it can recover is essentially what it comes down to all right go ahead and do that and shale you feel nice and warm at full health as the mass cure wounds tickles you unfortunately no if only correct no they were just for that little bit of damage the scrying will take you about ten minutes or so that's if you were all on eagle-back which you don't you have eight people and you currently have two summoned eagles yeah the speed of the slowest here you're looking at walking up the mountain shale walks away and starts hiking up the rocks at the very base of gatshadow to attune to it will take you a short rest that's up to you guys actually you check and the equipment that you have attuned to you and attached go into the form with you so at this moment you realize oh the axe you look behind you and it's just been dragging behind you in the dirt carving this path in the rocks and rubble like a kid with a deflated balloon you're just dragging behind you you know where it is he is up at the top of gatshadow somewhere in that mountain at the moment seems chilling short rest or not what are you guys doing it's about a mile up you're looking at the better part of a day yeah take shifts with the eagles back and forth probably about an hour if you're going to do it that way yeah you're still looking at about an hour and a half at that point with people moving there and back and getting enough rest you can't short rest on the trip and the short rest is about an hour half an hour right but you still have to have the eagles that went to the bottom to pick up the second team to get there so you're still looking at about an hour and a half to two hours it's a concentration spell you can only have one of it up at a time yeah and it only lasts for an hour and you've already been at this for probably about ten 15 minutes you have about another 40 minutes of the eagles you'd just have to recast it you said you have transport via plants right if you wanted to scry up that mountain and look at one of the trees at the top you could do that that would be technically the fastest way it depends on how close the nearest tree to the cavern would be sure umbrasyl was looking pretty rough at your size the three of you would probably be able to take one eagle because you are tiny so we'll say for the purposes of this it'll take an additional cast of your spell so mark off a second casting of conjure woodland beings however that brings-- what level is that conjure woodland beings conjure woodland beings is a 4th-level spell laura animals there we go sorry so yeah that is 3rd-level so yeah mark off your second casting there you guys manage to make a short rest between the journeys making your way up towards the dark blackened rock peak of gatshadow we're going to take a short break here for restroom we'll be back here in a few minutes in the meantime we have an awesome video from backblaze to show you guys-- we'll be back here in a few minutes guys stay tuned for apparently the attack on umbrasyl's lair see you in a minute [break] okay i'll let it happen usually you attune one item in a short rest i think it's fine for this you get attuned as you walk up the rest of the way it's fine so you're out of hit dice all right everyone else good ready to jump back in (laughs) yes you did but you know loosely where it was as you guys slowly make your way up towards the peak of gatshadow you all come to rest maybe from what best you can tell is the entrance cavern that umbrasyl currently calls its home across this blackened dark craggy surface you see clumps of dead petrified trees leafless gnarled and devoid of any life there are signs of melted stone soot long ago there may have been a fire that claimed the top of this mountain and set its visual presentation that got its name however this is your moment should you wish to make your way towards your conflict with umbrasyl how do you wish to prepare there is a cavern opening there are a few small little inlets into the mountain at certain points but the path that you guys land on that ends you're going to have to climb around the mountain to get to the entrance of this there is no walk-up path actually just an opening on the side of the mountain you're about 400 to 500 feet away from the entrance you stealth ahead and look a little bit and you notice the path comes to an end you probably have about a hundred feet that you have to scale the side of mountain to get to the entrance you see one other small entrance about maybe 60 feet below it a little bit to the left that is not my music that's the atmosphere which actually you-- this was probably a couple hundred feet back they made it near the peak however they were spotted upon the approach and you heard the battle the very short battle that ensued heard the screams of them far from your eyesight yeah it's all atmosphere guys i paid them to do it i know all right towards where the actual walkable portion of this mountain cliff ends you have about 40 feet of scaleable wall at an upward angle before you can reach that small little inlet that you saw there an additional 60 feet beyond that is the larger entrance where you saw the best you can tell umbrasyl retreat towards-- or exit before when you were watching him emerge from the mountain that's it yeah totally so we'll say for the purposes of that anyone at this point who'd like to make a stealth check to go ahead and keep yourselves hidden from any onlooking parties add ten for pass without a trace the armored cleric cannot be seen (laughter) with vex's help you guys manage to take bits of the mud soot and the burnt remnants of the once lush forest that dotted this mountainside and darken your exteriors to help obscure the vision of anything that wished to pry along with the magic drawing the shadows to your forms you're pretty confident that most of you would be fairly difficult to be spotted by most creatures that's ridiculous ashley and you've stealthed through time people who had seen you previously in your past have no recollection of ever actually seeing you (laughter) exactly all right so what's up now there you go just smear it okay on umbrasyl well here let me pull up the actual specifics for scrying here it largely depends it's more like picking a location as opposed to an actual-- okay you are familiar with the target as you've done battles that does adjust the saving throw for the scry so without further ado what's the dc of your spells currently 19 hmm as your eyes close your vision projects itself beyond your form beyond the craggy landscape of gatshadow out beyond the mountain pass that ends abruptly beyond the cavern entrance you are pulled within the darkness suddenly you find a little bit of light scatters across the damp stonework of the inside of this cavern you see stalagmites you see pools of murky greenish-brackish liquid ever so gently disturbed by the wind that curls in and out of this cavern you see towards the back an elevated platform next to another pool where a large outcropping of stone that has just slowly pulled itself out of the rock nearly touching the very height of this cavern you don't see anything in there all you hear is (low breathing sound) that's all you see okay go ahead-- all right so you manage to find bits of rock and pull yourself across the way it's not too long a distance but enough to the point where i need you to go ahead and make a basic strength check 14 okay it's hard and you feel part of your muscles build up lactic acid from the exertion from the previous round with umbrasyl and you not being necessarily the strongest individual of the troupe but you do manage to scurry your way up to the edge of this small opening in the mountainside getting inside you get a look this hole continues for about 15 feet into the mountain before it ends abruptly the only other thing you notice is there are currently four long-dead skeleton corpses within this hole perhaps some sort of mountain-climbing expedition or travelers that found their way there and couldn't escape there are remnants of a small camp perhaps a small fire that is long iced-over through winters past a layer of dust sits on everything and other than the occasional gust of wind that finds its way in here largely undisturbed for a long period of time okay you rummage through the remains you find roughly 85 gold pieces amongst their corpses and spare change in silver and copper-- copper the pennies of d&d poor things copper dragons everywhere are just so disappointed you do find an oil lantern climbing gear for four people some long-spoiled rations and you find a very moldy diary as you're scanning through most of the pages that are still intact and not completely molded over or destroyed it appears to be a journal that contains writings of what was an expedition to reach the peak of gatshadow because there was some sort of movement some sort of activity up there that nobody could really discern the rumors speak of some sort of creature that would stalk out in the night and steal mountain goats (belches) pardon me goats steal mountain goats steal or find and kill anybody who lived in-- there used to be a smaller village that lived north on the mountainscape that is now abandoned because of this creature the folklore of the time said supposedly lived at the top of the mountain it speaks of the entrance the place that umbrasyl now calls the lair and this leads you to believe that this is a fresh lair umbrasyl did not appear to always live within gatshadow but is only currently making it its lair at the moment make a perception check actually this would be investigation 20 feeling along the walls you find elements of the rocks that are easier to break off than others but this is predominantly the end of this cavern so vax finds his way back to the group (whack sound) no because unexpected she is swift and she is strong for being one-armed and of her age the sting hits the side of your shoulder before you have a moment to really understand and your diminutive form is thrown about three or four feet back before you catch yourself make an insight check really so chris which is easy because you put out the proper hand for the one arm she has so you're coming up to the entrance go ahead and make another strength check you manage to climb your way up to the larger mouth of the cavern it's about 40 feet across at the very front of it and about 50 feet up it's this large-- yeah and the rest of you guys are you pursuing rest of you climbing along the mountain as well all right everyone who's climbing i need you to roll a strength check there's no actual walkway to it i don't think they are no advantage on the roll 16 okay 18 all right okay and you're floating up all of you begin to shimmy across the surface the wind is piercingly cold the clouds up here are dark and there isn't enough moisture to rain but there are flashes of some sort of wild lightning storm that go off in the distance in the roiling clouds as you're making your way across pike your foot skips across one of the stones it breaks and falls beneath you and you almost lose yourself grog grabs you and holds you in place and pulls you back up you all slowly make your way to the very mouth of the cavern you've been at this point as well you wanted to go ahead and make an investigation all right go for it 24 feeling around the exterior there are two rocks that are nearly identical placed at each side of the cavern entrance upon approaching their texture and their weathered appearance is far younger than the rest of the stone around them and that catches your attention the nature is some semblance of a magical enchantment this is a little beyond your understanding unless you want to try and roughshod it in the way you know how as keyleth and shale approach the threshold that you're currently standing at the rest of you are a little ways behind he points out these two stones go ahead and both of you guys make an arcana check shale just from what you've seen in the world oh druids you ascertain shale just from stumbling upon such constructions this is-- there's some sort of magical essence to these rocks it's old magic which is the only reason you really recognize it it's not the hoity-toity-learned-in-a-tower magic all the stupid people in the world tend to learn this is old magic that's all you were able to pick from it it's old magic there are two stones about three to four foot in diameter that are almost matching that are younger less weathered than the rest of the stonework around them they're on opposite sides you could circumvent them they're not in your path they are embedded in the sides of the wall so you could pass through them over them however else you want to try and circumvent them you can yeah yes your 4th-level stoneshape you cause a portion of the rock wall at the side of the cavern to actually forge itself into a tunnel circumventing the exterior rock on the left okay so roll your stealth check yeah because you've come out of stealth and back into it so you make your way into the next portion you're actually able to start seeing-- --in a raised platform in a pool of somewhat pungent-smelling liquid as you get even remotely close to it the fume causes your sinuses to open and burn and tingle make a perception check 27 you hear a very faint breathing breathing that is trying to stay quiet but by the sheer immensity of the beast creating the sound you can pick up the very subtle movement of air through the normally still cavern (faint breathing noise) stealth about there would be in tandem with where you were as he curls back the cavern is revealed further the pool does come to an end there are pieces of stone that jut out of the floor you do see now scattered across the grounds occasionally a bit of shine a little coin-- gold silver-- elements of wealth that've been dragged deeper into the cavern that have left behind them some remnants in the process of being carried and carted in actually no because she's really well stealthed no you guys have no visual perspective on each other you've all stealthed away from your own party yes there is the light grows dim at about this point then it becomes darkness at about this point yeah what little bit of daylight that's coming in the cavern entrance would be over here what you can see it is flat there's a little very faint breeze that occasionally comes through so there's a slight disturbance here and there but no specific visual disturbance because of your darkvision being an elf you can see pretty much to the edge of this there's no displacement of the pool a little bit of a further view just the cavern continues in that direction you can hear it very faintly you can't quite make out the source there is something about the room and the air that's travelling through here the sound itself you're just barely catching it and it seems to be reverberating to a small extent off the walls of this cavern which carry sound very well you look up you see about 60 feet 70 feet in the air just past where your vision begins to fade-- the only reason you know there's a ceiling there is because there are a few points of rock the top of the cavern does descend into stalactites-- it is yes thank you not from what you can see no the mineral build-up of the inside of this cavern leads to a direct slick surface in the walls the minerals rounded off most of the stone make a stealth check all right what is it all right so you're back where you were the rest of you what are you doing this opens up slightly more and you get to see a portion of the mineral growth-- a lot of the moisture that has coalesced into the ceiling has come into a central point and over time it just built up these central columns of rock and natural materials a few pools have gathered towards the base you see portions of the ground where elements of the acrid liquid that filled the pool over here just dripped in whether they began this way or turned by the dragon's presence you are unaware but that's as far as you can see at this point you can make out that additional pool of acid the far back corner and a risen platform you see the portion of the cavernous stone beginning to mass into a higher level towards the far back corner roll a perception check 20 you listen in silence stillness the very faint whisper of wind far behind you as you come around this corner being as careful as you can looking around you-- (impact) your shoulder hits something roll initiative all right so you have just bumped into the currently invisible form of umbrasyl lying in wait in the far corner of the cavern that would be a 20 initiative from umbrasyl at this travel pace it's been about 45 seconds or so you hear jenga out of the back of the earring as let's say the rest of you guys are right here i assume trinket is in your necklace all right this is going to be you with your big stick chilling here with the rest of the party so at the top of this round you just hear the growl the snarl (snarling) you say jenga blades already at the ready you go to stab as (swooshing) all of a sudden you hear this swishing sound of air being cut through at such a speed that it causes a high-pitched whine claws and teeth come spinning out of nowhere you can't even see your attacker but you feel the brunt force behind each of these blows no you've still got uncanny dodge on one of the attacks just from your roguish instincts correct it gets disadvantage on the first attack which is going to be a bite that's a natural 19 and a two with the two that brings it to a 17 so with that you (whoosh) see for a split second the ripple of teeth snap before you missing your face by mere inches before they disappear once again two more claws (whoosh) towards you the first one that's a 19 again and a seven that's going to be a 22 oh your ac would be 20 because you're not hasted right now so that would put you at 18 points of slashing damage halved to nine also your displacement is gone from your cloak yeah for the next attack it's a 19 misses you 20 yeah the second claw swings through at this point from the pain of the first strike of the dragon claw hits you you back up to the very edge of the cave and duck out of the way as you hear the wind change as you do you hear the stone crash behind you as the claw misses you slamming instead to the side of the cavern wall it's now your turn you hold your action until one of your friends is on it and then you move okay so that ends your turn everyone else i need you to roll initiative your initiative from before was-- so 25 to 20 (laughs) percy so that's 20 20 to 15 another 19 nice so pike then keyleth scanlan what did you get (laughter) and scanlan taking the rear as you guys hear the crashing of stone at the far corner accompanied directly after the whisper of vax's cry-out of jenga you already know shit is going down percy you're up first clutching the bottom of the broom that has not moved yet what are you doing with your turn so you're firing in this direction go ahead and make your attacks at disadvantage due to the massive size of this currently still invisible entity you do manage to catch an odd bullet towards its form go ahead and roll damage all righty (gunshot sound) gun goes off echoes little bit of dust comes loose from the ceiling and falls down as you ready for your next shot at disadvantage this time the shot goes the second time (gunshot sound) poofs against some stone in the distance not hitting its mark so with that the third shot (click) nothing emerges from it and you look down it's not been a day for percy not a dash because you used your action as she takes her one good arm and cleans out missing an eye now or maybe missing an eardrum (laughs) that's going to end your turn percy this one right here that brings us to vex you would still have one more use yes go for it at disadvantage on this shot as you cannot see the actual entity you're firing into the darkness 19 nope okay as your reaction you guide her-- though the blazing bowstring was unfortunately used on the first attack that missed okay i misunderstood as you go for the attack you see the actual arrow bursting into flames not quite sure where to fire you're about to pull back and aim and pike shouts to you putting her hand out suddenly a spark of divine energy hits the front of the bow and corrects its course beyond your actual arm motion and you release based on the faith you have in pike the arrow strikes true you hear a slight growling roar from the distance go ahead and roll damage 22 nice it would say in the actual item you send trinket out ten feet in front trinket is going to go-- it's 40 feet right trinket rushes forward there you go make your second attack trinket goes (angry bear growls) big old grizzly bear charging into the darkness growling echoing through the cavern 27 with disadvantage still hits yeah your honed senses to dragon-kind you can remember the mass and general size and placement based on the sound you heard from the growls from the first impact you made you just strike again in the same direction hitting true roll damage 12 damage just on the one yes i'll allow it because he is currently threatening it it was a lucky shot it was a very lucky shot all righty good to know so total of-- 17 thank you both arrows done trinket rushing in-- you can duck down but you've used most of your action in this turn to sail in and you can't hide per se makes sense all right so we're now at 20 at this point in time the roar hits (roaring) echoing through the cavern as the echoing begins to vibrate and the noise doesn't subside the low hum turns instead to a (buzzing) as seemingly out of the pool of acid a cloud of biting stinging insects emerges (buzzing) floats in this direction getting the three of you right there i'll say for the purposes of this that you guys are both in that radius anyway this cloud of insects moves in to-- i need percy shale and vex to make constitution saving throws 18 so you guys both being dexterous and quick but also able to maintain your form-- the best you can at this turn-- manage to pull out of the way without too much impact however poor shale is surrounded by the insects you take 12 points of piercing damage as the insects riddle you with bites and stings at this point now you hear a few footfalls vax you see a splash in the pool next to you that almost scatters against you bits of it hitting the edge of your armor but the armor absorbs the blow being attuned towards acid resistance a few other steps as it begins to walk away i'll allow you to make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage-- yeah as you sense that it's moving away you wildly swing out in front of you 15 whiffs on air however (heavy footfalls) moving forward a voice comes roaring out into the area you dare soil my home after what you've done below i will watch you dissolve before i suck down your liquid forms i need vex pike keyleth scanlan and percy to all make dexterity saving throws not enough to prevent this it's a lobbed stream of liquid acid that comes and surrounds corroding not unless you have something that gives you advantage on him nope all right so you use cutting words to reduce the damage 18 all right hold on i'll just double-check while you're saying this just to bring up the ability it would have to be a damage roll because there's no attack roll there's no other roll incorporated on this other than the damage roll right but it reduces the damage roll which affects everybody it's faded since it's a concentration spell yeah if you were to use cutting words on this it would reduce the damage all of you would take from it what are your cutting words scanlan go ahead and roll your bardic inspiration die so 18 saving throw what was yours keyleth vex one pike seven okay reduced by three you all suffer 47 points of acid damage you take half of that you take 23 points of acid damage after its long angry boastful diatribe as it rears back to blow your words confuse it and the spray seems a little off-center than what it intended however most of you are now currently dealing with the searing pain of the acid pressed against your bodies ending that turn vax you're up you did it came from there this area correct because you don't know if it moved away or not you don't know exactly where it is you just know it's somewhere in that vicinity nope 22 just hits trinket however is actually adjacent to umbrasyl so you could do sneak attack damage 26 all right so one dagger just vanishes into the darkness the other one sticks into the hide for a second before disappearing in a plume of smoke reappearing at the side of your belt you hear a low (snarling grunt) all right looking at the rest of this cavern-- there is what seems to be the majority of the funds that were gathered from westruun and whatever else of the previous dragon's hoard have currently been brought over to the new lair who knows how much has been-- so that end your turn all right now it comes to shale you are currently surrounded by stinging biting insects there you go you come pushing through brushing them off with your stump and your staff waving it in front angrily growling you come to rest at the side of this one pillar that juts out of the ground with vex right above you you can't see anything but you do hear right in front of you a growling snarling bear you see elements and flashes of the bear that you saw vex summon forth from her throat it's stomping around a little bit you saw where the actual projectile came from so you know it's somewhere in this vicinity a nine you hear slowly curling out from the darkness ahead of you bravery means nothing survival and victory mean everything and that's how you end a round pike you're up okay so you move over and leap up onto grog's back holding tightly what's the trigger for your action that you're holding the next time you sense the dragon is attacking somebody all right what action are you holding is it a spell so you begin preparing the spell you are now concentrating on it as you're holding the back of grog okay holding that bit that brings us to keyleth what are you doing you don't know over here you're going to get up around there unless you want to try and go over the top of the rocks that way is going to require a climb check all right go ahead and make a strength check yeah it's not too hard you ran up grab leap over the side you can get right there in this vicinity you can see trinket is currently snarling and lashing out and biting in this area of the cavern all righty so faerie fire you guys watch as suddenly this burst of somewhat violet-ish blue light like a small tiny explosion of glitter and starlight just hits the area and outlines the entirety of the large dragon umbrasyl yeah failed saving throw actually you know what yeah i do third and final legendary resistance you get a glimpse of where umbrasyl is and then the magic dissipates umbrasyl vanishes from sight he can succeed automatically it's a choice to succeed nope no that's true yeah it does yeah well no essentially he rolled at disadvantage to make the saving throw failed it and then decided to succeed using legendary resistance as far as you know from previous experience with dragons there are no further uses of its legendary resistance does that end your turn keyleth it's a level one spell you still have more up your sleeves if you wanted to try it later you can't use a bonus action to hide unfortunately because you're not a rogue sorry girl you can totally do that and you are currently hugging in the pillar going (panting) at the end of keyleth's turn it's going to use two of its legendary actions to wing attack it's going to beat its wings everything within 15 feet which right now would only be trinket has to go ahead and succeed on a dexterity saving throw go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw for trinket 12 okay so trinket takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage-- because of the armor then you can find another dungeon master all right so that ends keyleth's turn grog you're up this way all right that's about as far as you can get there so that's movement with pike on your back so that's your movement all right (growling) sends you into the rage you still have your action anything you want to do are you holding your action for any particular thing all right that ends grog's turn scanlan you're up not from what you can tell no okay you take your d10 inspiration die and stinking cloud haven't seen that in a while stinking cloud where are you setting it right there all right we'll put this over here to keep track of the stinking cloud we'll just know the insects are in this vicinity as most people have passed beyond it with that umbrasyl is going to attempt a constitution saving throw three plus 14 that's a 17 what's the dc all right that will technically be at the start of its turn but we will carry that over all right the cloud appears in this space you can already hear (coughing) are you going to move or stay where you are it's still in this vicinity yeah if you want to make a strength check to climb 17 yeah you actually hopscotch up leap over percy and get up on top next to her over there all right that ends your turn scanlan with that it's going to use its third legendary action this turn to attempt a tail attack against you vex you're welcome i will stab you that is a 19 to hit 20 with that you dodge out of the way you feel the impact of some large heavy slam onto the stone right next to you pieces of it break off and then withdraws barely dodging it in time all right that ends-- yes you can what's the word appear there you go oh that's cocked all right that is a19 plus 11 i'm pretty sure it makes the save sorry that would've been during your turn you can only hold your action good try brings us to the top percy you're up all right towards the pool you can get there you're outside of the insect cloud not a worry as you're running you're cleaning it polishing loading it okay looks good okay your second wind go for it okay vex yeah you do see some elements of the cloud are displaced in places it's not showing you exactly where it is but you are aware that the entity of umbrasyl is directly in front of shale and nearly directly in front of you no not to mention the fact that you are technically in its melee range so any of your ranged attacks-- unless it's five foot is it five foot or is it melee trying to remember i think it's five feet but regardless it's close to you it's bad news trinket can move independently of you it's half-movement yeah okay so trinket's going to go ahead and-- roll a perception check for trinket but there is a stinking cloud right there roll again we'll see if trinket can discern between-- that would be trinket's wisdom-- 22 okay trinket (bear sniffs and growl) runs past here but can only make 20 feet of its movement because he used the rest to get out of prone however strafes aside and begins reaching out and starts snapping so you want to give trinket-- okay as part of your attack action is that what you're doing as your bonus action on it okay go for it have trinket roll for an attack with disadvantage because it is invisible 15 trinket slashes out in the air with the obfuscation of the stinking cloud and the invisible dragon trinket's just getting mouthfuls of air on the broom still i mean that will give you a little more action you just can't attack from the broom because you'll have disadvantage on your attacks since you haven't finished your set-up yet as far as you can get on your regular feet there you are completely out in the open you have no way of hiding right now you be can like hide you don't see me yes you can there okay you can get there however as you rush by umbrasyl does get an attack of opportunity on you he's going to make a bite as you rush by that is going to be a 30 to hit all right huh no that's not quite what it does (laughter) a total of 33 points of damage as you rush past all right that ends your turn vex all right the insect cloud fades away insects just dying off and dropping to the ground in piles of currently twitching insects however the acid pools suddenly begin to rumble and expand and reach out any creature within 20 feet of the pool has to make a strength saving throw so that will be shale grog pike and vex strength 23 good to know pike all right 13 and five all right so you guys both manage to as the pool swishes out and comes up to your knees grog and you just pull back and lean against the wall as the pool subsides back no immediate effect just barely manages to catch you however both shale and vax are pulled 20 feet into the pool-- i'm sorry vex i keep saying it now over and over again pulled into the actual acid pool yep i'm sorry about that you both are knocked prone and pulled into the water because it is an acid pit you both also suffer 12 points of acid damage both shale and vex all right now umbrasyl who failed the saving throw-- i can't believe stinking cloud worked the creature spends its action retching and reeling yep so the action is spent the dragon is just (coughing) which is good because it rolled a five and got its breath weapon back but it can't use it this turn because it's coughing and you-- i will--  it rears back about to spit the acid before (coughs) and bits of it come streaming out of the nose like the milk-in-the-nostrils thing except for it's acid that's the dragon okay that ends its action it is going to move out see if it's-- i forgot to roll concentration for the invisibility on the last attack that happened i just rolled a one with that it appears once again on the map the invisibility spell no longer there it's going to stomp over out of the cloud right there he does actually go ahead and roll for trinket 17 that misses or it hits and trinket's claws streak across the back of the dragon's hide no damage sustained but good job trinket all right so-- he's doing great vax you're up all right what's the far range on it he's out of range still can't get close enough not with your full movement you can move 30 feet okay okay so you pull her behind the pillar you go ahead and feed her the healing potion that is your turn he dragged you out of the acid pool all right so that is a 4d4 plus four healing to you that ends vax's turn shale you're up you do actually you take six points of acid damage you've now stepped up right there the dragon is fully visible to you go for it you have three attacks correct across the hide no damage as a level 13 fighter don't you get a third attack with your action okay roll damage with the quarterstaff okay all right go for it 15 hit points to you go for it ending shale's turn that brings us to pike but at the end of shale's turn the dragon is going to use a legendary action to attempt a tail attack against you scanlan as you are the source of the stinking cloud that caused it to cough it goes (growls) foolish bard get back into my stomach and as it whips around its tail comes streaking overhead and it rolls a natural one (cheering) pike it's your turn you're in the position for it what level are you casting guiding bolt third level on guiding bolt all right that will put it at 6d6 so go ahead and roll a spell attack go ahead and roll 6d6 and we'll double it it's a critical hit 50 points of radiant damage right up umbrasyl's posterior suddenly as pike still clutching onto the back of grog you reach and grab the symbol of sarenrae leaving your sword to the side of your sheath hold it forward and as you do you concentrate a glowing beam of radiant energy shoots forward just as shale knocks the backside of umbrasyl the tail streaks overhead to hit scanlan leaves you a nice direct shot right at the dragon rump there's a dull (impact) sound and umbrasyl sits straight up for a second (confused noise explosion) as there's a burst of divine explosive energy right in the posterior (painful growl) looking back there's now a shiny glow pulsing from the back of umbrasyl's body and the next attack has advantage against umbrasyl that's your action you still have your movement and bonus if you want okay where do you want your spiritual weapon to go what level is spiritual weapon second level yep all right where are you setting it all right sitting right there at the tail of umbrasyl this giant glowing radiant meathook appears and makes its strike go ahead and make your spell attack against umbrasyl all right that hits go ahead and roll damage it's a 1d8 plus five nice all right going to stay where you are or you going to move so you're still piggybacking on grog got it okay that ends pike's turn keyleth you're up actually at the end of pike's turn-- okay you're staying where you are though okay so you'll be there at the end of your turn umbrasyl's going to use another legendary action to make a second tail attack at scanlan again frustrated by this whole circumstance that's a 20 you may if you want to it's a natural 20 you could reduce the damage though with your cutting words probably for the best for that you suffer 28 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail swoops down finding its mark slamming into you sending you against the wall of the stonework and you stumble forward back into place feeling already the impact of the bludgeoning wound so you reduce that to 24 so 24 points of bludgeoning damage from the attack however umbrasyl's next saving throw is at a disadvantage because of mythcarver now keyleth what are you doing yes it does with disadvantage on the saving throw so that's a four plus nine because of the disadvantage i rolled a ten and a four that will bring it to 13 it does not succeed you watch as a second burst of purplish energy surrounds umbrasyl radiating a glow gilmore would love this right now fancy dragon now we're talking you went from being not able to see the dragon to very much being able to see the dragon all right okay look at you being a druid and shit water elemental keyleth are you going to stay there if you'd like to you gather yes pretty big range you're right there scanlan is right next to you to the right unfortunately the cliff ends right there so you couldn't get in front of scanlan without dropping onto a lower platform percy is down there you could fill some of umbrasyl's space but you're not going to be able to guard anybody from an attack unfortunately especially being an entity made of water not a whole lot of defensive strategy in there shale's over here flanking from the side all right grog you're up there you go you already have advantage on all the attacks because of faerie fire so you don't need-- yeah go for it barbarian crits man well do the damage for the critical yeah 24 okay the dice roll is well you roll 1d12 what was that the first d12 you rolled 12 so make a-- it was a 12 oh shit okay that's a 24 and then you add your modifier and then roll two more d12s so that's 24 plus is that seven plus the two for the axe oh my god that'll be at 33 plus the necrotic-- oh fuck and that's doubled too okay yeah we have to now so it's 24 plus two for the axe plus seven for the strength hold on getting there we're getting there it's getting math crunchy here guys so 24 plus nine so that's 33 plus-- the necrotic times two which is ten that's 43 plus the two other d12s which is an 11 so that's 54 plus your last d12 you did 64 points of damage with this one critical hit all right so that's your first attack 20 the first strike swings wide and slams deep into an already open wound left by a rogue earlier in the sky this time the axe sinks deep into its body and umbrasyl roars out in immense pain you see spittle and blood both being jettisoned from its mouth under the sheer pain that it's feeling you take the axe and you push even deeper and push even deeper and withdraw as you do the blade is entirely covered in deep purplish-black dragon blood you swing for a second strike this time it puts its claw out and catches the axe in the middle of the air you manage to wrench it free from its grasp but it turns its head toward you angrily that is channel divinity i'll go ahead and double-check here real fast it won't do anything it helped you with the temporary hit points it helped you with-- sam marisha and it helped you with the fear-resistance to begin with that was a big one channel divinity war god's blessing and you can channel divinity twice so you can do it a second time you can wait didn't you use it-- between rests yeah you could do it a second time if you want to all right so with that with a plus ten brings it to 30 so as umbrasyl grabs the axe stopping it in mid-air you just grin reach forward with the axe and push it into its actual claw go ahead and roll damage 27 points of damage all right and do you want to use your bonus action yes you do all right 21 as you push the blade into umbrasyl's hand (angry snarl) it rears back its head and snaps toward you you duck out of the way pull the blade back and go for a third strike this time however it actually rears its torso up putting its claws in the air and you (slicing) find air right beneath it does not strike true yeah that finishes grog's turn at the end of grog's turn it's going to use its third legendary action to go ahead and make a-- actually no its going to hold onto that legendary action all right that brings us to scanlan scanlan because you took the tail attack earlier i'll have you roll a concentration check for stinking cloud you have advantage on it though so add your constitution bonus yeah you're fine you can i think it moves from a short breeze actually older versions i think you could bigby's interposing hand all righty the idea is you can use your bonus action to set it each turn to what you want it to do so right now you're having it as an interposing hand so yeah it prevents it from moving-- the interposing hand interposes between you and a creature you choose until you give it a different command it stays between the two of you providing you half-cover against the target so it helps from ranged attacks okay so you're just going to go and clenched fist of course you are go ahead and make a melee spell attack that would be over here d20 add your spell attack modifier 27 that hits go ahead and roll 4d8 force damage as bigby angrily jams the magical finger back into the wound it's 4d8 force damage ten points of force damage all right scanlan are you going to move or stay where you are vax is over here he says this as a giant bigby's hand is just (impact sounds) at the side of a giant black dragon that brings us to the top of the initiative round percy it's your turn oh my god you are about ten feet from it right now okay percy you walk right up to the dragon 26 hits 23 points of damage all right 22 just hits go ahead and roll damage all right go for it i know seriously all right as you unload on umbrasyl the pent-up anger and frustration you start slashing over and over again you guys watch as the blade shines in the air in the presence of its naturally designed enemy you see at the corners of his outfit little tufts of dark smoke beginning to appear the scar of orthax still shows when the fury builds within percy as each blow strikes cutting away hunks and bits of dragon flesh and scale umbrasyl is heavily wounded and looking desperate that ends your turn i believe you guys gave it time to rest amazing what a dragon can do in two hours all right vex actually at the end of percy's turn he's going to use his third legendary action knowing the source of the faerie fire and extremely frustrated by the fact that it has lent to a very difficult round it turns towards the now water elemental quivering before it and the tail comes down to smash towards your liquid form speaking of natural 20s 32 points of bludgeoning damage halved because of your elemental does water elemental have resistance to damage all right so half that so 32 made to 16 16 points of bludgeoning damage i need you to go ahead and roll a concentration check roll a concentration check so roll a d20 and add your constitution modifier you maintain concentration you needed to beat the 16 well half the damage no it would've been ten actually because it's half the damage you receive all right cool so vex what are you doing a lot of them are pretty much the whole party aside from pike you and your brother correct thank you yes it does go ahead and roll damage as a bonus action all right good memory on that one 19 damage all right yep go ahead and roll damage for the second hit 23 all right so ending your turn comes to the top of the round umbrasyl now gripping into the stone i will not fall suddenly darkness begins to sweep into the area in this area a 15-foot radius all completely around umbrasyl all of you in this area your vision goes dark cancels out faerie fire this is magical darkness no this is an effect of the lair actually faerie fire would still affect it if you attacked it per se but it doesn't reveal its location currently within the darkness however it is technically larger than the darkness regardless all of you guys that are in there it would negate the advantage you would have from faerie fire it would just be a central attack a little bit of it's piercing through because it is magic on magic however the rest of you see most of the party disappear into a giant sphere of magical darkness that fills the space you see the wings poking out the sides of it you still see where he would be okay so with that umbrasyl is going to go ahead and take a risk he's going to lift his wings and head upward to move into an advantageous position unfortunately you have to be grasping it or grappling it to attempt to-- which one trying to remember how this works college of lore i don't know if it is because what you do is you grapple-- oh war caster thank you that clarifies it i was like i don't see this in the college of lore you're confusing me so as a war caster when a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an opportunity attack so yeah if you wanted to go ahead and attempt to grapple-- you can totally attempt that bigby go ahead and make a strength athletics check to beat a dragon's strength bigby is just slightly under the strength of the dragon so let's see it's a roll-off it was a 19 on my end natural 19 as bigby's hand reaches forward the angry wounded frustrated furious umbrasyl just kicks the hand away pulling up attack of opportunity from you you you and you no it does not get attacks of opportunity without advantage because of the magical darkness that has surrounded you guys the darkness would give you disadvantage the faerie fire negates that i'm letting you do this that hits okay grog all right so grog and keyleth both get a hit in go ahead and roll damage 20 all right good to know because that's bullshit so as you swing out you arc and the axe strikes across the back of umbrasyl's hide you slam with your water elemental form the flight is staggered and barely lands on his feet umbrasyl i will take you all down unleashes i need a dexterity saving throw from shale percy keyleth and scanlan all right shale actually succeeded on that one dc 23 so you take half damage on that one that's going to be doing the dice rolls here so that's 62 points of acid damage down to 31 to shale and 31 to you because you're resistant so 62 points of acid damage to both of you guys your armor takes it by half so you would take 31 and with that it takes the rest of its action to move further back at its 80 foot flight and it's going to end up right about there i know leaving the spiritual weapon there all right that's going to end its turn that now brings it to vax oh you need to make a concentration check by the way from the damage you just took he did add your constitution modifier the faerie fire fades as the acid consumes you no longer affected by it all right vax it's your turn to answer your question no nope okay that would be about there okay you go rushing clambering onto the back of its tail it swoops around and sees you doing so but you're already quick and on it what are you going to do okay good to know all right that takes the end of vax's turn shale you're up speed of 20 feet you said you can't quite get to it unfortunately that's about as far as you can move this turn you can dash if you want to but even so you still can't quite get to it okay there we go all right ending shale's turn pike you're up you do actually that's true 22 that just barely hits go ahead and roll damage nine points of damage got it technically because you are behind you are flanking it so as we'll use the flanking rules for this you do have advantage on the attack 29 hits go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack 24 all righty correct yeah you just get the one action to hold so as part of your action surge you get two more attacks the one hit it snorts in reaction to it as it pulls back you swing twice more pretty sure the head was in the same place it was going to be but unfortunately meet air curse your sight caught the attention all right that brings us to pike what are you doing what level is prayer of healing within 30 feet of you so five ten 15 20 25 30 that's as close as you can get right now it's enough for scanlan and keyleth percy's not in range you can stay right there okay you can just barely make out the position of where umbrasyl is you can go ahead and make the attack but it's going to get cover bonus to the range you can move here if you want to and it'll help a little bit it'll only give it a minor bonus go ahead and make your attack go ahead and make your spell attack is this basic level guiding bolt okay you try and reach around and as it's moving its wings about you manage to strike the stone just blocking half of its form it splashes with energy and dissipates with no effect unfortunately yeah you can do that yeah 20 feet to there is that as far as you can move it spiritual weapon can move i believe it's 20 feet yeah that's as far as you can get it the range of the spell is 60 feet but as a bonus action you can move it 20 feet and repeat the attack keyleth you're up yeah yep you're not sure okay what's your movement as a water elemental 30 feet 60 you're so close fucking dragon wings there you go you're so close we'll say you're there that's fine that ends your turn keyleth all right grog you're up there's healing and then greater healing so i imagine it would probably be greater healing yeah sure go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw to catch the tossed potion at that distance you don't even look you can keep moving if you want all right finishing grog's turn scanlan you're up i'm conflicted in giving that inspiration take it it's fine no it's perfect throw okay so bigby's hand will move with you 60 feet okay we'll go ahead and use some of the platforms today problem with leaving it to heal man should be more like there we'll say you may 29 hits 26 got it all right second attack both hit go ahead and roll damage all right as bigby's hand lifts you up you reach out and swing with the axe one hit a second hit both streaking across the face the second one actually cutting through one of the eyes the eye bursts against the blade of bloodaxe and you can see now the fluids and material that once were contained within are now spilling down the side of umbrasyl's face all right scanlan that was your bonus action i'd say there's an arc you could probably hit yeah sure the heart region of the dragon all right that is a dexterity 21 save so i'm pretty sure it's halved go ahead and roll 8d6 half damage 12 points of lightning damage all right the bolt of lightning bursts through the body all righty that comes to the top of the round at the end of scanlan's turn it's going to use a legendary action to strike down with the tail onto vax behind as you are already in that vicinity no this is instead going to be a 26 to hit that is instead a 24 to hit all right so what would be 18 damage you take nine instead from the tail percy it's a greater yes 4d4 plus four okay that is nine plus 14 23 dragons okay all right second shot the first one (boom) slams and blasts near the ocular socket of umbrasyl shattering the bone but not actually damaging the eye the second shot manages to go through the wing but unfortunately the area was already damaged and it's minimal in the effect on the dragon third strike it fell to the table two other shots unfortunately (bang) okay end of percy's turn going to use another legendary action to slam with the tail once again towards you vax this is going to be-- correct 25 you only get one reaction so yeah that's going to be 22 points of bludgeoning damage whack the tail comes down and slams into you putting you face-first into the stone you can feel the blood run from your nose from the impact as the tail picks back up again vex you're up arrow just splinters across the dragon's hide what was the second one 16 the second arrow strikes the side of umbrasyl's face unfortunately once again the wood shaft streaks across broken and destroyed by the impact that ends your turn okay you can do that roll stealth did you add sneak attack oh no because nothing hit sorry sorry i was trying to be mindful trying to help failing miserably but trying no hunter's mark got rid of that okay good to know top of the round magical darkness fills this entire sphere once more encapsulating grog vax and everybody else in the area of the dragon vision is taken you are all considered blind and have disadvantage on any attack rolls dragon does not seem to be-- blind where you are affected by it correct yes actually let me see something with a five yep umbrasyl is going to turn up towards you grog the head peeks out of the darkness for a second right before it fills your space and it just says i will finish this you hear a familiar sound of gurgling and then (liquid spray) out another time this is going to go for everything in that vicinity that's going to be keyleth shale grog trinket and percy you couldn't move that far unfortunately that's as far as you could go with your movement so i need a dexterity saving throw from all of you guys yeah and trinket oh what's the range on cutting words unfortunately unfortunately the distance of the bard just to make sure 60 feet yeah so that's 66 points of acid damage to grog shale halved to you and 66 to percy trinket is unconscious and dissolving percy is unconscious and dissolving grog you're good hit points yes you do shale what are you at fantastic she's got grit she's got perseverance all right grog go for it not with advantage the reckless is for your actual attack round i'm pretty sure it is let me double check just so the internet doesn't yell at me it's going to yell at me anyway it always yells at me during this turn not round so yeah 27 was the hit that hits roll damage 22 how do you want to do this (cheering) so held aloft by bigby's hand acid sprayed in your face two of your friends on the ground unconscious and dissolving in the center of the dragon's lair grog strongjaw how do you want to do this as you lunge forward the darkness fills you but the feral instinct that you've grown up with is enough to know the source of that pain the source of that acid is also the source of victory and as you swing wide the jaw still extended from the blast of acid you push through it as it's spraying into you and the sheer force of your blade hits the edge of the jaw and you push and you hear from the back of the throat as the acid is projected the gurgle of horrible shrieking pain (groan) the stream stops as the blade goes towards the base of the skull pushing forward and upward you divide the actual mouth of umbrasyl like that the darkness (whoosh) flicks out as you guys watch grog descending putting your foot now onto the front of the dragon's neck you stand up getting hold onto where the wound is there still living the one working eye flitting about wildly you reach up and grab the edge of the nose bring the axe up with the other hand and slam again and again and as you do the eye rolls back the whole body begins to fall limp as it crumples backward vax i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw 25 okay you dodge out of the way as the dragon plummets to the ground (heavy impact) what was trinket's maximum hit points let me check something here the remaining damage yeah you're fine umbrasyl's body hits the ground the two arms reach up and the body still continues to pull itself backwards you pull out of the way the head lolls around the jaw now grossly cartoonishly open giving out these horrible choking sounds as the blood and bile and acid all mingle it tries to talk the bubbles continue coming forward before it stumbles the arms sprawled out its head falls limp to the side as the eye twitches and then falls still as you stand there shale watching the dragon fall as grog strongjaw the once runt of the herd of storms slams the blade over and over again in the dragon's head a little part of you is a little jealous and another part proud and a little sad that this was not the time for you to lose your life in battle against a mighty dragon (sizzle) i can make that joke in two weeks as you go and bring trinket around for a second using the last bit of the magic that's been afforded to you as a ranger trinket comes to (bear grunt) a lot of the fur has been singed off and spotted flesh with acid burn but is conscious and alive and weak trinket leans forward as you're cradling his head and licks the side of your face and tucks his nose into the side of your shoulder (bear grunt) you go ahead and help percy get off the ground you come to consciousness again and you see pike's hand touching yours as she lifts you suddenly a surge of invigoration hits your body and you find yourself feeling a lot better than you did a few moments ago heal man clerics don't fuck around make an investigation check you do 12 okay you guys spend the better part of the next 15 or so minutes glancing around and trying to find any sign of these strange obsidian spheres that were previously in the lair of krieg or brimscythe after coasting through the crates and barrels gold piles the various artifacts and trinkets and things that are strewn about this back corner no sign of anything like that there's a lot of things in there there are weapons there are two glaives polearm glaives there appear to be a number of pieces of ornamental armor very beautiful made of gold and platinum that were either used for ceremonial reasons or just adorning some sort of popular hall strangely enough no nothing seems to glow in the vicinity of the hunk of quall there are two glaives pulling the list up here going through the whole hoard because it is 1120 we may pick up the actual looting element at the beginning of next session we'll be here for a while if you want to do that you have probably another 20 30 minutes or so before it fades checking in your various pieces of equipment you have on you as opposed to what you have stored elsewhere you had a few vials they are a little jangly when you reach for them and you realize they've been crushed go ahead and make a nature check all right so as you guys are gathering the elements of this dragon's hoard gathering the equipment the art pieces the relics all things that were part of this-- and it is especially since you know as far as dragon hoards go especially for an ancient dragon it isn't huge and with the recent moving in you get the idea that this dragon's true hoard probably exists elsewhere this was either a temporary lair or was intended to be the new lair and the process of transitioning hadn't quite begun most of the gold here seems to have been what was given to umbrasyl by the herd once they had taken over westruun that you saw in krieg's lair no you do know from having one made by allura within your keep before that they take quite some time to ingrain dragon's only really had over a week or so so gathering up the materials the remnants of that hoard you guys descend down the mountain if you wish or is there anything else you wish to accomplish within the actual lair right based on the roll you made so we have two empty vials that you managed to acquire yeah it's difficult because with the nature of umbrasyl's death as well as being a creature that is naturally caustic and acidic in a large portion of its body there was a mixing of a lot of the blood that has caused it to become impure while vialing it so you get three vials of the blood that are still pure and viable everything else seems to dissolve through the glass upon contact many dragon's teeth were sundered in the ravaging of umbrasyl at grog's furious storm of axe blade strikes however you do manage to harvest from the body unscathed 14 ancient black dragon teeth quite a lot of scales here yes it's going to take you a long time to harvest what you can off this body a lot of the areas have been damaged from the various wounds and such how much time do you want to spend to harvest scales you have no idea as you come down and-- ravaged and eaten horribly in the bramblewood never to be seen again no you come down and as you speak with the remnants of the herd of storms many of which a number of them did survive the battle though scarred horribly and many did lose their life in the battle with umbrasyl zanror worra recovering all right however the number's now thinned down to a simple 12 members of the herd as you speak with zanror he looks to you and says shale you live have you word of the mountain the dragon good good he takes the tooth and gives it to worra well vox machina they call themselves good we need greatness in this world we-- he grins to himself it is but there's been a lot of cost in it too i'm glad you're back shale your wisdom stays strong we've been talking here i think the herd of storms died in battle with the dragon there's not many of us left there are and while we lost the rivermaw i think maybe it's time we went and joined them they're damper lands better for raising children take a break from all this warring and go back to a simple life will you come with us shale good we'll set out tomorrow at dawn we plan you guys set up for the evening resting your sore bruised bodies smelling the ruin of the black dragon as you prepare for an evening's rest well-earned we will close this evening's session well fought guys it's amazing you imagine why he didn't mention it before but scanlan does indeed have a hot spring in his magnificent mansion no it's magnificent guys a big thank you and round of applause for chris perkins
