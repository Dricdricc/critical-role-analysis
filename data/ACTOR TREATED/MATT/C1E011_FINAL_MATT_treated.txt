when we have a little more time so we'll get to that shortly all right so i think that gets us up to speed on everything we're trying to get you guys up to speed on before the show so welcome to critical role to give you guys a little backstory as to where we are for those who are tuning in for the first time oh you are tuning in to an interesting time this party of adventurers were tasked to locate an individual a famed folk hero a paladin of bahamut named lady kima of vord who on a vision quest went to search out and destroy a great evil that was germinating beneath the dwarven city of kraghammer in the cliffkeep mountains the party upon delving beneath the city discovered it breached into the underdark and following her trail fought past duergar ashy-skinned evil dwarves past mind flayers and various other terrifying denizens of the underdark eventually saving lady kima after weeks of her own torture and discovering that some great evil named k'varn had unified these normal enemy races the duergar and the mind flayers the illithid also finding that apparently this individual-- yes sir oh well snap let me finish explaining this and we'll do the giveaway they discovered this entity called k'varn this great and powerful entity which apparently had acquired an artifact known as the horn of orcus that adorns its head that gives it some sort of power imbued by the dark god of undeath orcus himself the party then managed to find its way into a cavern where the illithid city yug'voril exists and after a scry spell via keyleth last episode unveiled this entity k'varn to be a dastardly beholder an extremely dangerous aberration that currently holds at the top of the temple in the city a stranglehold on the mind flayer civilization so that was where we left off the party slowly encroaching the edge of this island and we'll start in a moment once you give the giveaway all right guys so be active in the chatroom that will enter you as part of the giveaway we've already hit that so the giveaway should be happening very soon so say hello say your opinion be around and have fun that's right well so it's a shame scanlan is not here at the moment since-- i'm just saying it's a shame because he's right in the thick of this sequence here so as the party was making their way up the shore they found bits of the ruins that coat the entirety of the subterranean city they found what looked like some sort of a large stone partially crumbled fighting pit and what looked-- as vex vax and scanlan were stealthing over scanlan himself invisible had stealthed over to scout ahead managed to find what looked like an encampment of some kind a series of rags and furs a very large living space for some sort of creature scanlan failing his stealth roll seemed to draw the attention of whatever entity lived there which was an extremely tall large giant-like creature malformed kind of pale purplish-gray skin one squinty eye and one bulging yellowish one that was dragging something fleshy and bloody behind it it turned towards the rest of the party going to inspect what seemingly created the sound near its homestead and that is where we left off right now you're on the outskirts of the fungal forest that covers large portions of this island where you are right now is on the edge of this stony pit that's dug into the ground it's about a 15-foot drop down into this pit where the remnants of this encampment was and the leftover large fire pit that's just slowly burning ember coals scanlan is still invisible next to you guys don't do that there are chunks of ruined buildings in the vicinity probably a good 30 40 feet from where you are you guys are right along the edge (booming footsteps) okay so the two of you leap off the edge of this down into his living bedding area the two of you leap off down both make an acrobatics check favored terrain makes a ranger very happy 22 20 and 22 all right the two of you leap off-- the 15-foot fall is easy to tumble through and both of you land right next to this large pile of rags and furs you both quickly dive inside which the instinct of survival prevents you from immediately realizing the terrible terrible scent of long-festering body odor what smells like a combination of dried blood and some sort of excrement as well as whatever entities once wore these furs or adorned them on their fleshy self there are still chunks and pieces of them dried and/or still rotting within this pile so both of you sit there for a second diving underneath keeping as quiet as possible scanlan is going to attempt to make a stealth check all right as this giant humanoid beast starts lumbering forward and you can just barely catch a glimpse at him because you guys are hiding from behind you can see giant saggy fleshy ears this kind of bulbous nose it looks almost like tumors all across his shoulders and back and his teeth are kind of broken and nasty there's this black in the gums it just kind of steps and looks over the edge (sniffs and grunts) licks his teeth for a moment looks over takes a couple steps around the edge glances over towards the edge of the forest both of you make a constitution saving throw as the smell itself it is a terrifying awful smell a natural one top of the game natural one gets no bonus that is an automatic fail what kind of a choice is that true so vex as you reach over you notice you put your hand up to shut him up but an unfamiliar liquidy warm sensation hits your hand as you catch him mid-vomit stream (laughter) you manage to muffle some of the sound this is really disgusting i'm sorry guys all right the creature suddenly whips its head over towards the pile of rags and goes (grunts and sniffs) what's that smell grabs the edge and leaps off the impact of its weight no more than ten feet from you you feel even through the softness it is still soft through the nastiness you feel the impact of both of its giant thick tree-like legs slam into the stone right around you scanlan sees this hears this and instinctively without much recourse his invisibility fades as he begins to form an incantation thankfully he's distracted at the moment but the large entity is going to attempt-- i'm sure he does see if he sent something to me yeah he texted me the same stuff all right so no what he's actually going to do is he's going to cast domination so as he finishes the spell the giant creature as he starts reaching and pulling the sheets back it pulls back right as you guys see its horrible gnarled face right in front of you its nose you can see dripping with liquid from somewhere inside as you pull back your blade all of a sudden it stops and looks up turns around looking over at scanlan on the edge and scanlan goes hey go for a walk and the giant okay climbs up to where scanlan is and just starts walking towards the fungal forest at the edge of the area i don't know come back scanlan says come back the giant turns around sit down it sits down still hasn't made its saving throw even sitting scanlan is up to its knee you've seen giants to an extent at some point or larger creatures an ogre would be about waist-high to this for just reference there that's about the size you're looking at he's a tiny guy tiny guy scanlan goes you wha-- you told me to do something you guys aren't there i know that's what we're working through stealth check all right you get about a third of the way through wrapping the rope around his body he kind of just sits there looking confused at you his jaw looks slack you continue to wrap and as you are pulling on the second round all of a sudden his expression goes from dull slack to angry travis and he looks down at you scanlan goes oops i think it's worn off at which point he makes a tense physical action against the rope that you've bound him with and before you have a moment to react with a powerful surge of energy breaks through all the rope that you had tied him on you are now standing at the base of him at which-- you guys are on the shore go go someone let sam in all right so as this giant entity reaches over and is going to attempt to try and slam his fist down on top of you that is going to be a 21 against your armor class yes all right you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage as the hand just slams down onto your sister presumably he doesn't seem to notice you there okay go ahead and make an attack roll on that what'd you roll you do have one reaction to this as you stabbed and missed you have a reaction as well after you've taken it you pull yourself from under its fist and it's now starting to get up onto its feet proper oh what you got he's getting up now he was sitting down okay all right how big a large this creature constitutes as huge that'll do yeah all right so so go ahead and make a roll a contested roll for that if you don't mind (laughter) you got this you got this we're going to find out here in a second let me pull up the spell all right so i got it right here grasping hand all right so use the hand's strength score to resolve the grapple so you roll that and add eight to it what'd you roll on the d20 18 plus eight that's 26 all right versus its athletics okay so as it's getting up suddenly you freak out bring your hand up and you summon that same sparkling wave of arcane energy that shoots out from your hands forms this giant version of your hand clings around both his arms his torso and tightens itself around its body as it does it stands up and it's currently grappled yeah so mark off your domination also the target takes 2d6 plus five damage crushing as you're now grabbing and forcing its body nine points of damage total to it all right gotcha to this wondrous entity yay all right all right great so that ends your turn it is currently grappled it is now your turn you can go ahead and we'll say you've been down here scanlan is right here and you are right here not with trinket because you went out to scout and stealth so that's you there you guys hear that those of you who have earrings shout that out the rest of you are starting to run liam and at full-round sprints yeah it's not going to be a very quiet walk for pike that's okay it'll take you guys about two rounds to get there at a full round so-- okay oh it takes a while to make a sleep arrow yeah it takes like-- yeah we'll go into that later all right so you go ahead and pull out the single arrow first or sleep arrow first okay you realize if you damage something that's asleep it wakes back up i'm saying if you do sleep arrow first you hit him then you do a second it'll wake back up just letting you know okay 25 definitely hits 16 damage for the first hit fantastic go ahead and roll damage on that did you multiply the dice that's a critical hit not for the multiplication no it's after the fact 25 yep 30 damage all right so as it's still standing up and you see as he's standing up now he's reaching off to the side and he's pulling a giant club up that was kind of leaning against the side of the inner portion of this giant fighter's ring as he pulls the club up you pierce him in the arm with the first arrow and he looks down at you angrily with his one giant eye glaring and the smaller one the second arrow pierces the smaller eye and he pulls the arrow out with his fingers like a little tweezers angrily i will say because it was a critical hit on a sleep arrow normally what you would roll is 5d8 to see how many hit points it can affect go ahead and roll 10d8 it's not damage this is just to see whether or not you can put it to sleep 47 so the arrow pierces him and he pulls it out and you can see for a second the eye gets a little-- he flicks the arrow off and it snaps as it leaves his fingers and he glares down at you with his other eye angrily shrugs off the effect that would have been really cool unfortunately he still has a lot of hit points left sleep arrow is something to glide into later in the battle you don't know that no fucking-- you're still on the beach oh no you still did the 30 damage from the sleep arrow that was just to see how much hit points it would affect if it was going to put him to sleep but a nice try all right so that ends your turn that brings us back to the top of the round between you guys so we'll wait for the rest to arrive before we do full initiative we're just running off of the sequence of events here did you want to move at all or are you going to stay right here okay so as you start running backward we'll say to about there he has a very long reach with a club and he gets to swing at you as a reaction so as you go bolting he just takes the giant club around (whoosh) streaks it across the ground yep which means he's in a bad situation and he because he is grappled it means he can't move from his current spot he's being held in place his speed is zero but he still manages to roll a 14 to hit all right so you jump over the club roll off the ground turn around get your bow back in ready position untouched that's the end of your turn now it's his turn he is going to-- did you throw the daggers or did you leap up to try and backstab him there right so you're right there he-- -- spins around bends down just glares at you with his one giant yellowish eye with almost a slit pupil in it as it does you feel this strange oppressive force come from the eye into your mind and i need you to go ahead and roll a charisma saving throw 17 you manage to resist whatever effect this was you shrug it off it looks at you angrily even more and takes its club and slams it into the ground like a giant pouty child it looks like it's-- yeah the smell is still present in your face pulls its club up to prepare itself for its next round that's its turn oh no sorry it also makes one attack it gets to use the evil eye and one attack so angrily it's gonna lift up its club and slam down towards you that is going to be a 15 versus ac can't roll worth crap today club comes down (impact sound) actually breaks a good portion of the stone on the side of this that comes up falling backward and tumbling into a pile inside this pit as you dodge out of the way that ends its turn no you're up scanlan no scanlan first and then you and then you so scanlan yes yes yes you are yes he is okay yes it comes from you and it goes in a straight direction you get the feeling he has about a 15 foot reach with this so as long as you stay within that reach you're still gonna be okay currently yes you do where are you going to move it's 15 feet up so you can jump down into the ring if you wanted to go down there or you can move around this way he's big enough where you'd be able to see him so you leap off the side as you leap in the air he glances over with his large eye and does a backswing with the club in mid-air trying to basically baseball-swing you we'll find out that is an 18 okay you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage as he (impact sound) really like backhand swing hits you go ahead and make an acrobatics check because your landing has now completely thrown you topsy-turvy the impact throwing you off your balance (laughter) 20 will do like a cat you correct your trajectory in mid-air and still three-point land (laughter) all right go ahead and roll 8d6 dexterity he does not make his saving throw he is too slow at that size you guys are running up to-- 31 total so after you land on your foot you turn around and reactively just fire this bolt of bluish arcane energy it streaks up slams into his face and shoulder area you can see he rears back from the pain of it reaching up in the air like he can somehow fight off the lightning bolt as the bolt passes through him it leaves this burn mark on his chest and the side of his face smoke is (sizzle) up off his torso he looks very pissed you do you may i will say the mild echoing sound of mildly off-key whistle following a mighty lightning bolt is inspiring enough go ahead and take a d10 and now it is your turn okay so are you going directly for the eye acrobatics check so as he's reeling back from the blast of the lightning bolt you see that opportunity you jump up onto his partially bent knee use that as a platform and leap up in the air daggers drawn slow motion towards its face go ahead and make your first attack since you are going directly for the eye-- i will say that it is at a disadvantage on the attack but if it hits it will be considered as a sneak attack i will say it's a disadvantage on the attack but if it hits him in his eye you will do sneak attack damage 26 all right that one will hit eight plus your 5d6 oh this is the second attack that you did right technically you were both going for the eye i'll say i'll allow it 26 points of damage so the first dagger you attempt to swing down he actually moves his face out of the way and it just scrapes across the side of his cheek doing nothing more than a scratch but the second blade strikes true slamming into the side of the eye as it pierces for an eye you expect would pop it's still a hearty material you actually have to push into it it's almost like it's full of hot muscle on the inside of its eye the dagger still drives in and using your weight you drag down and cut it open on the bottom it screams out in pain and pushes you off you barely manage to catch yourself on the ground you haven't seemingly blinded him but you've definitely left a serious mark on his eyeball do you want to use your movement at all you can or do you wanna stay where you are right you can use your bonus action oh you used your bonus action to do your secondary attack i know i know i'm pretty sure as a rogue you can use your bonus action to do disengage that's one of the benefits but you used it as a secondary attack to get sneak attack so you could move out of the way but you'll take a swing from him all right so you'd say you'd move back to about there as you do he reaches up and grabs his eye with the other hand picks up the club and backhand swings at you that'll be a 19 you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage but as the hit slams into your back you manage to just catch your feet underneath you so you don't topple off the top of this edge ends your turn what you got vex all right so you pull back same wooden shaft all of a sudden sprouts these nice thorny jagged spikes on the sides as you release the arrow hits him 3d10 damage go ahead and roll that 17 second attack go ahead and roll it 17 does hit he's pretty big he's a big ol' sack of hit points and no armor 17 yep don't forget your hunter's mark okay so 22 nice all right so one arrow hits him in the elbow and it looks like it pierces the sinew that holds the arm almost goes slack for a second before he flexes and tenses you hear the actual wood shaft snap as he brings his forearm up grabbing his club turning around you shoot the back of his elbow causing him to drop the club on this hand he looks extremely frustrated at the process now he's got blood streaking down both arms he reaches down to grab the club again to try and prepare himself for another round of attacks you guys are just now arriving the fomorian is going to finish its turn and then the rest of you guys can go he's going to take two swings first he's going go ahead and angrily leap forward to there small jump lands on the ground takes one swing at each of you actually no that's a valid point he is still grappled thank you for that he's going to try and break from the grapple for his move that is going to be an athletics of 20 go ahead and roll a d20 and add eight attempts to break free of grapple can't do so he's stuck where he is he currently has nothing in range to attack no you're 15 feet below he doesn't have range on you at the moment he tries to take a swing at you but partially because he's so high up he cannot move and because you are so small you literally just stand there as the swing-- the wind blows your hair back a little bit but does not find purchase on your body completely wasted its turn well done all right so that brings us to you again actually no it now goes to everyone else because they have all arrived on the scene now you guys are all starting to appear we'll say-- over this area so who's going first all right everyone all together now all together now he's considered a giant all right so we have 25 to 20 25 to 20 20 to 15 15 to ten okay marisha and all right so percy and keyleth all right so ten to five ten to five you're an eight all right we got vex-- all right that is almost everyone who-- one yeah scanlan all right tiberius and pike you're up first as you guys rush on the scene seeing this creature being currently crushed by the semi-ethereal giant arcane fist of scanlan pike tiberius what are you doing okay so you're going to use your aqua sphere all right what is the effect on huge creatures what it officially says watery sphere so as you create the sphere around it the water forms around its physical form it doesn't seem to be affecting it it's large and strong enough to the point where it's thrashing because he's holding it in place but the sphere is just having no effect he does there are cleaner portions of his flesh this creature's a little larger than what you're used to capturing with a sphere this is an ogre essentially he's much cleaner (laughs) all right pike what you got you what okay okay all right so you're creating a spiritual weapon we'll say this can be considered just an additional grapple all right good to know so you create it i'll just use this as the spiritual weapon in his space currently it begins to wrap around him rapidly one two three four and finds purchase on its own self holding it in place so there we go do you want to move with your turn or you want to stay there you're right here as a note real fast guys let's see if we have the-- no i want to make sure we have the laser pointers for you guys everyone forgets those all right i have one here all right so we have two over there all righty good to know thank you for your patience for the purpose of what you want to do with this grappling hook it's not going to do any damage to him it's just going to be an additional grapple to him holding him in place all right that brings us to grog you can talk but it comes through in single words and usually not in a diplomatic way grog next after this is vax it's a little late for that unfortunately he's ahead of you go ahead and make a persuasion roll with disadvantage so the bound twisted malformed giant creature that's currently held by ethereal rope and ethereal hand glances over at you for a second and you swear you hear a chuckle (chuckles) and spits a basketball-sized loogie onto the ground in front of you i would say that diplomatic attempt on him would be your action you would be raging as a bonus action okay do you want to move as well all right that gets us to vax it's a big 15-foot wall that goes down into this pit going stealth for this i would say would be considered part of your move it's a disadvantage if you're stealthing while moving actually for you isn't hide the stealth ability that you can use as a bonus action so that would be it yes it would be your bonus action to attempt to stealth yes yeah go for it that's two luck points what did you roll you don't know if you're stealthed or not all right 16 and an 18 gotcha all right cool so we have an 18 stealth technically (sarcastically) so pitiful as far as you know you may or may not be hidden what are you doing okay yeah you wouldn't be able to wait you'd have to wait until next turn you can't hold part of your turn you've already taken-- okay so are you shimmying along the side he's 15 feet above you you're down 15 feet you would have to throw a dagger to hit him at this point okay currently bound kind of easy to see he's really ugly you throw a dagger up towards him with your action you've already used your bonus action to go stealth what'd you roll plus-- tell me what your final numbers are okay yeah both of those unfortunately miss you fling both unfortunately the process of jumping down and running as you chuck it at the end of your movement next to scanlan even though he's bound you're just a little off your game it just cascades out of sight and then vanishes appearing back on your belt that brings us to percy and keyleth you're over here okay 20 hits okay arrgh (heavy impact) i will-- (laughs) okay so as you shoot off the kneecap he tumbles forward over the edge this way both of you guys make dexterity saving throws it's a 50-50 shot on which side he fell your dexterity saving throw 17 no but you're nearly crushed by an extremely large person all right percy does that end your turn okay keyleth he's 15 feet down you can move up to the edge here look down and see him on the ground currently restrained and struggling on his back i'd say you would be able to okay (sings) i'll use this naga figure for that leap down and you're trying to grapple him all right so go ahead and roll a d20 what's the strength bonus of the form what's it say for the constricting it should have the rule there for it all right so you add six to that okay you start moving around and even though he's still struggling in his form he gets one hand up and is holding you at bay you have not managed to grapple him yet but you are in the process of trying to next round you can try again he's pretty strong vex yep he looks-- there's been a lot of grappling this past round he took a lot of damage before everyone else showed up and it's been just a lot of holding him you can't see him right now because he's fallen all right and now you see him on the ground all right both of these shots are at disadvantage because there's keyleth currently trying to wrap around him as a giant snake so just each attack with disadvantage that hits second attack secondary sleep arrow all right go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep 17 also hits all right so go ahead and roll damage on the first arrow with your hunter's mark damage all right 16 okay and then go ahead and roll 5d8 for the sleep arrow yeah wasn't a critical hit sorry 22 as the arrow sinks into him you see him struggling against both the snake form and bigby's grasping hand as it struggles and throws about the grappling hook tightens on its form-- now she has one so for the moment combat is paused you guys do what you need to but be aware that every period of time he's going to be making saving throws clarota steps forward and goes i can for a short period of time or i could just take its mind i would then have its memories and knowledge at my disposal until it resists the influence for eight hours no nothing in my repertoire lasts that long which is why i say let me take his mind i'm hungry the creature begins to flutter its eyes for a second clarota immediately looks down and puts his hand out and releases a force of arcane sparkles that cover its body and it falls back asleep you don't know much about drow poison go ahead and make a nature roll 20 you know that drow poison for the most part would not facilitate keeping something alive okay you go ahead and glance over the top it drops down about 20 feet in what looks to be a series of long rusted-over metallic spikes whatever this pit was previously used for was almost like a gladiatorial experience you can see what looks like some clusters of old ancient bones at the bottom mostly seen disuse for hundreds of years so what are you guys doing how long does geas take to cast okay you can certainly try we'll see how long you guys can keep him restrained right as you guys are getting the chains around him he maintains his slumber you guys continue to bring the chains around it's a big body and there's a lot to get around how much chain do you guys have total by the way length-wise 150 feet of chain okay you get the chain-- full length of chain around his torso area you start getting it around his legs you start pulling the rope around he begins to wake up once again he begins to thrash about he rolls a two to break against the chain he's currently still grappled clarota releases another sleep spell okay you take one of your eight fancy robes you had kicking in the bag of holding it is probably the nicest thing this creature has ever worn just keep that in mind you finish restraining him with the chains who's doing what perception check 24 you do see what looks like some sort of mild glimmer of metal that amongst all the rest of the weapons and armor that have been destroyed down there one seems to have resisted the age that has stayed there is nothing to find purchase for here it's just a pit okay keyleth you're casting all right so we'll say-- we'll get there it takes you a full minute to cast it every round he gets to resist the sleep spell actually no this spell just puts them straight to sleep so this spell he is asleep for the duration you finish your geas spell all righty all right so we have geas so it has to make a wisdom saving throw so what is the dc spell dc yes 18 all right as the sleep spell wears off his eyes begin to flicker and you see the strength flexing in his muscle form as you hold the axe there his one slashed but you know not bleeding in this moment eye it seems that a lot of the fancy robe has absorbed whatever was oozing from it he glances down at you in this horrible guttural series of phrases and consonants (speaks undercommon) anyone speak undercommon the two of you-- you do he says essentially what have you done what do you need its eye slowly tweaks over back towards keyleth what do you ask of me the giant takes a moment and his head nods slowly like-- kind of yeah (laughter) all right he looks down at the chains and looks expectantly at you he seems to be in agreement best you can tell you get the chains off and as each hand is free he (grunts) shakes it free all you kind of jump back for a second and places it on the ground and stands up to his full height around you i'll assume that you're no longer a naga as you cast a spell eventually he gets to his full height and stands there looking down at all of you kind of glancing around grabs the large hardened piece of wood and stone that he's fashioned this club out of and glances and says to you you translate for her where slings the club onto his shoulder with a hefty (impact sound) you all feel the actual impact on his body just the nearby presence the air around him being pushed looks at you for a second looks back to keyleth and gives a solid nod and just stands there his hand reaches down and completely envelops your fist and just pulls away jerky is gone from your hand and you feel probably a few scales went with just glares at you the big eye squints in confusion at the tiny thing and just keeps licking the remnants of beef jerky off his fingers that it just robbed tiberius of all right so the two of you guys move towards the pit you're what now you are-- okay you hold on you get down the spikes now that you are up close you can see are about five and a half feet in length at the base about that wide and pretty nasty jagged covered in whatever rust soot ash found its way there it's nasty times it's going to be a little careful to get in there without hurting yourself go ahead and make just a straight dexterity check 25 you manage to mission impossible-style swing underneath grab the rope you manage to keep yourself at a lithe side angle where you reach between two of the jagged spikes reach down and grab this metal pole that was shining pull it out and it's an intricate gold and bronze javelin 23 okay pass it on to grog all right so you guys now stand on the outskirts of yug'voril we're a little ways from yug'voril and the fungal forests in the distance you can barely see the dull greenish glow of what encompasses the top of the temple what is your plan of action as you've now bound a fomorian to your will well this will be more of a-- yeah this would be a-- this will be just a nature check foh-morians foh-morians what'd you roll all right between you and your understanding of the underdark as well you manage to suss out a fomorian is a long-cursed species of giant that lives in the underdark specifically that's why its form is so malformed and physically messed up they are inherently very evil very selfish creatures and the fact that you even have it in your presence says well of your magic but also means it's probably very very very minimal in its control or ability to really help you unless it absolutely has to so sometimes things might want to take damage depending on what you tell it to do just saying you're riding a very fine line keeping this thing not thrashing and smashing your head right now you ask in undercommon the best you can get out of his response is the equivalent of i don't really know or care i hunt i find things that wander too far from this city and occasionally squash a dwarf or two kima looking at him says i'm not sleeping next to him her eyes for a moment seem to dart to your shoulder where you had previously shown her your awkward purple third nipple i'm fine scanlan but i-- i appreciate the offer meaning not him individually his actual species long ago it was a line of giants that was cursed by the fae to be this horrible form best that you understand not a lot of study has gone into the breathing apparatuses of certain aberrations and the few that have been close enough to a beholder haven't really tested that theory the top has the brass crossbar some sort of translucent material that fills in the parts that aren't the brass it appears to be to where you want the pillar to come out of yeah all right so to bring the map on top here where you guys currently reside which is this portion here you imagine based on the distance you traveled you have about a mile or so before you get to the city maybe a little over a mile actually probably a mile and half before you get into the city which is about two miles from the temple it's already been attempted to be healed this day yeah it's like a once a day kind of thing okay so you take a bit of the swirling yellow orange-ish viscous fluid out of-- you place it against some organic matter which you find somewhere in the vicinity partially rotted chunks of-- -- flesh from the pile the fomorian was sleeping on as you place it on it blackens the flesh around it there is a sizzling sound which organic matter which inorganic matter so you're putting it on (shouts) google will answer that at the break so as you take a dab of it and you place it on the rusty instrument which actually looks like some weird hooked crowbar-type implement the rust immediately cleans off and the metal underneath begins to slowly warp and bend and then dissolve at the place where you dripped it placing it on the sapphire it kind of coats it slips off and begins to burn the ground around the sapphire clean it off it looks like there are very very minor pockmarks across the surface but yeah essentially what you had seen in the vision was within this room there is that giant brass gold bronze-looking structure that almost like an upside-down christmas tree it comes to a spiraling point above the elder brain pool which is in a raised platform in the center of the room to one side there are two large cages that contain what look like some sort of skinless creatures that are currently being experimented on on the far end of that room there is a table that was set up with implements this is probably in the process of what k'varn has been just having fun toying with flesh on the opposite side of the room it was shrouded in darkness and that was where you saw k'varn reveal itself out of the shadow which at this point as you say that clarota goes that is not an option it is a powerful entity but it has its limits in its currently weakened form clarota is currently stepping back with a look of confusion at the term 'clarence' you see the tentacles go i do not know i was not around when it was created i didn't know it existed until you saw it i have not been in the city in months nearly a year it's a series of-- the way you saw it it is a cluster of brains that are kind of merged together into one large hivemind mound liam and yeah less a crystal and more a metallic structure it's a slowly like a spiraling mass of metallic pipes tubes metal bands that just slowly twists and comes to a gradual point like an upside-down christmas tree it could carry a grog and that's about it all right so you guys take an evening of rest we'll take this as our break our little quick ten-minute break guys we'll make it quick so we can get back to this because we have a lot to try and cram into this evening so we'll see you guys shortly wait do we have a-- yes thank you so much yeah i think you should keep it it has a dragon i think the mouse is actually-- keyleth so the staff-- i will say if we're pushing to go to a dance party after this since this is maybe a climatic slightly overtime game then we got to take a very short break see you guys here in a second welcome back yeah we hit 3000 on the break (cheering) so back to the game at hand you all after an evening of taking turns resting the best you can nothing catches your eye although occasionally you see a little bit of movement very slow movement just outside of your main light radius along the edge of the top of the pit you guys slept in just kind of fade in and out something just drifted away eventually you all come to your fomorian friend is just sitting there in a very unfriendly aggressively passive manner just staring at the rest of the group expectantly he takes it in his hand which to him looks like a small mug he peels the top of it off breaking the wood (gulps) (shattering noise) make a wisdom saving throw should you choose to you manage to resist the urge to fly into a rage and smash your axe into the face of this entity you bite your lips you can taste the blood in your mouth okay as grog rushes up in a blur of angry motion you see a trail of froth in the corners of his mouth as his head comes colliding into the giant i'm going to say for this go ahead and make an athletics check can you check for me so as grog runs up full-force angrily slams his goliath-skull into this large fomorian underdark giant you hear what sounds like a clap of thunder nearby and you swear for a second one of the two heads are about to crack or explode from the sheer force of the impact you see grog whose head is approximately a fifth the size of this entity has hit it with force so strong that in that breathless moment you're waiting for grog to scream out in pain with blood pouring down his face however it is the fomorian who reels back from the force of the blow his giant eye closing in severe pain before he falls onto his back stunned (groans) as grog stands over staring down at it it's only partially reminiscent-- and in your fury you didn't realize that you shouted at it in giant it looks up at you and gives you a nod of momentary submission as you step off of its body onto the ground walking away extremely furious well that happened the mending wheel continues its process the mending wheel completely forms it into a pure untouched perfect empty cask you roll medicine and what level healing you want to use you guys just rested everyone's spells are back at full just keep in mind what spells you want to have prepared and keep in mind what may be ahead of you so be sparing i recommend it looks like it's had advancement rolled 20 for medicine all right and what level healing spell are you going to use just keep in mind the battle you may have ahead of you so 1d8 plus five mark off a level one spell casting okay so that and the medicine check part of the scarring from the lava burns that still remains begin to heal over most of the scars are gone you're on the cusp of getting past your disadvantage but not quite yet all right what's the plan gives you advantage on your dexterity checks no and skills that are dexterity-based so stealth would have an advantage which is nice all right so we have scanlan there we go look at these guys here on the new carpet so as you guys hold place the two of you drift into the air just the two of you the two of you hop onto the carpet and begin to slowly ride up past the treetops of the nearby fungal forest as you curve upward into the air-- -- you get a very fine view of the city proper you can see a lot of these buildings in the outskirts of the city are rubble they have fallen in on themselves they have collapsed you can see pieces of foundation and ceilings and rooftops that have caved in and right in the center of the city is a very easy-to-see temple which in itself is essentially a pyramid with a flattened top there is that dull greenish glow that seems to just slowly trickle around the very top of the temple as you are just starting to crest over the top of the outskirts of the city proper i'd say about here are you guys going over the city are you following the outskirts what's your plan of recon you guys are currently now moving this way all right both of you roll stealth with advantage he has advantage 14 18 okay so you guys begin to crest around and you look down and it's very very dark there are what looks like these greenish spores that found pockets in the city that give off light this very very faint luminescence within the city and they get thicker and thicker and cluster and make the center of the city more bright and easier to make out the details of you don't know if these were placed there or if they naturally grew there and just add the ambiance to it but what you see in that little bit of light as you glance down are many figures walking and moving through the city you can see humanoid-sized individuals gliding through the city 20 30 50 illithid visible in one section of the city each carrying two to three slaves each some trolls ogres other dwarves other creatures of the underdark that at this distance you cannot make out their form but there is essentially a thriving community down here of mind flayers some of them it's hard to tell where they're going but there are some going to and from the temple carrying small satchels or boxes as they glide-- or actually they wouldn't be carrying it their slaves would be carrying for them and they're keeping alongside them as you continue around the side here you start getting more into the ruined area and this part of the town itself on this side is mostly nonfunctional it's abandoned and you can see the repurposed city construction by this colony has started in the center and over the past few hundred years or as long as it's been here it's slowly building and repairing outward as you crest around this side you can see a far ruin about another half mile to a mile off from where you are too far away to catch any details of it you cruise around this side and you hear this squeaking sound this (squeaks) and you glance up and you see what looks like a cluster of bats moving to the top of the cavern they're almost buzzing you guys in the head up above ten 20 feet ahead of you they're just coming back and forth over you you guys take it a little lower to kind of get away from that eventually the bats stop harrowing you you find your way back around come to rest back at the camp it was around this section here you saw in this portion of the city which is the only one example the best you can see around this this whole intersection right around the temple is pretty fairly populated with mind flayers and their slaves clarota puts the thought in your mind immediately basically this very strong realization that without the town freed i have no leverage with my people kima has finished wrapping the leather on the handle of the great maul that she's holding grasps it in her hands her armor freshly polished after waking up this morning looks at the rest of you and says are you ready to walk into the great halls of the warrior minds before us orion and kima looks at you for a second and pulls her own holy symbol out and says the guidance of bahamut has not steered me astray as of yet and your deity also has brought you down here for a great cause i think as long as they're both looking over us and we are straight and true with our intent we shall be fine as far as the tactics they seem sound as long as we can maintain the element of surprise i feel that if that is given up we may have to improvise improvisation scares me so everything we can possibly do to maintain a very quiet arrival is going to be the key to success in this does anyone have a net clarota motions for a second and says we also have to consider this temple has doorways in and out this chamber that k'varn has taken has ways to be opened and outside forces in do we have a way to seal these entrances if we are to do this fight so we don't have any additional visitors k'varn thinks for a second and says-- there are if i recall two doors to the room not large not if you damage the device if the device is damaged he no longer has sway over the illithid perhaps divination oh you mean divine inspiration that happens the moment you use it yes it's not so much hey god come with me it's more like please help me right now something may happen that turns the tide maybe in the battle like the moment you need the help is the moment it will happen most likely because of the rushed nature of this go ahead and make a roll roll a d10 add it to the roll nine as you're attempting to fashion it to the arrow unfortunately the vial shatters in your hand you take three points of acid damage it happens at the process of you setting it up based on the roll you made better to get them out of the way now then kima gives a nod to that and is like i'm useless at that range but we have a few members of the party that excel at that clarota pipes up and says the two other doors are accessible from only within the temple if you had two parties to enter the two other doors they would have to go through the entire subfloor find a way up which you're welcome to try but who knows that was all clarota had to add to that yep kima lobs her maul on her shoulder and gives you a look and says yes this day we save kraghammer cliffkeep mountains and quite possibly the future of tal'dorei but if we fall others will come to try and finish our journey either way we do this as heroes we do this together for vox machina she puts her hand out in the center clarota slowly hovers towards the center these terrible long lanky fingers almost wrap around the cluster of hands at the top cold and nasty trinket comes up and nuzzles in the center kima once more says for vox machina so what is the process here it's about i'd say 20 foot by 20 foot so it's a pretty wide square enough for all you guys oh yeah there's like a five-foot wall on the edge clarota turns to you slowly and says piercing in your mind with a force of honesty and almost condescending essence you will make it ten feet before the brain is pulled from your skull the fomorian stands up the fomorian stands up with his club and looks to you and says in undercommon what do you need licks the side of his giant club which you can see is covered in this horrible mixture of moss and rotting entrails from whatever he smashed the other evening licks it off and goes eat all right (grunts) like slams his chest most confused-looking mouse you've ever seen if there could be an expression of what the fuck on a mouse it's on that one who's on the carpet all right (laughter) trinket can't be on the carpet trinket's too heavy for the carpet keyleth are you hawk carrying the gnomes you can fit six people on the carpet no (laughter) boulder falls smashes party (laughter) so first shift is-- kima looks you dead in the face and says regardless of what your plans are i'm bringing this hammer onto the head of that foul abomination i know i will not survive this but i will be damned if i don't dent its face before i go noted second trip first be quiet too heavy unfortunately it's a big bear as you're having this discussion trinket comes over rubs his nose along you and gives you a look of like a very stern stance of essentially the feeling is trinket wants to be by your side for this mm-hm grog is not strong enough to carry a bear and you on a fly spell you can try there's a good chance he might drop trinket on the way over from that height which would be a splatter bear kind of yeah from flying over there on the carpet at its full speed-- i'd say it'd take about 20 minutes or so 15 minutes the carpet isn't extremely fast all right so so first batch vex vax percy scanlan grog is flying all right grog's there and we'll say clarota will go with you guys because clarota can stealth kima will stay back good all right as you guys all continue forward let's see keyleth are you going with them all right okay everyone on the carpet make a stealth check clarota goes invisible hmm yes it is you add ten to it there you go 18 total all right okay you guys make your way-- -- over to the temple the bats don't seem to take any notice of your passage you find your way slowly coming towards the temple that dull eerie green glow towards the top the carpet finds its way just along the edge to the point where you can safely step off on that little five-foot-wide section of walkway that surrounds the glass top and you do see it it is a relatively large see-through almost glass-like substance it's hard to say it looks like glass it's about a good three inches thick and the metal beams themselves are bolted into the stone itself yep and grog slowly flies over and meets up with you guys yeah did you roll a stealth check yeah okay so you guys are left at that point now go ahead and make a perception check actually no this would be investigate yeah all right you gather best that you can that the metal itself is essentially bolted overtop onto the stone if you were to run the acid along where the metal is overlapping and bolted down on the top that would weaken it significantly the stone itself is not going to help much but where that boundary is where it's essentially clamped that area right there is going to be where you want it to put a bleed through and coat all right are you going back for the others all right are you guys just standing carefully on the edge okay all right tiberius you head back all right eventually grabbing the rest of the group here all righty pass without a trace second time thank god (laughter) as you say that trinket suddenly straightens trajectory a little bit and starts finding this awkward zig-zag but nevertheless is finding some sort of purchase in this strange flying environment you can see if a bear could have an expression it'd be bewilderment confusion and slowly trickling into joy as you all begin to drift back over towards the center of the city if i can get a stealth check from everybody including trinket plus ten everybody on the second trip all right all right all right and for trinket as trinket continues floating behind the carpet you hear this familiar (bat squeaks)-- -- sound as a cluster of bats begin to descend from a darkened portion over the cavern they're about 60 feet back about 60 feet go make a persuasion check it doesn't matter what you roll you can't persuade bats they're bats i know but you can't persuade bats but you can't persuade bats i was just fucking with her oh i did not hear that i thought you were just trying to do that (laughter) i somehow missed that phrase or that never came up in the conversation anybody else hear speak with animals as a spell okay i missed that okay so so what was your persuasion roll then 18 okay okay now this comes into play good i somehow missed the spell this was a really funny moment of keyleth in my head i was like what is-- okay okay the cluster of bats you can see there is this odd green glow around them that is slightly reminiscent of the top of the temple they seem to shudder in place as you're giving off this strange series of squeaks and echo-based sounds and they seem briefly rattled as opposed to going away they just stay in place as you guys drift further and further away you don't know what that means but-- you're not getting chased eventually you guys come down you're now landing around the outskirts of this you stay on the carpet all right so what are you doing while they were off what were you doing there percy okay who has the mouse by the way okay all right all right make a stealth check 23 okay you take-- no no it's smooth stone surface surrounding this glass top percy as you've placed the acid around the two sides you kind of slowly move around and trickled along where the metal beams reach the stone the acid is having an effect but it's a very slow-- arcana check i mean there is a magical aura to the metal itself it does not seem to be protective in nature it is more of a best you can tell a transmutation-based magic probably something that is directly affiliated with how-- the effect it's having on the elder brain you use a tiny bit and it does hit the metal with a (sizzle) and begins to dissolve the metal but the actual metal material also balances the acid with a little bit so essentially you begin carving into it but the little bit you use doesn't keep burning through it burns to a certain point and then just loses its acidity you make your way about halfway through the vial before that one platform you feel is about halfway or more dissolved through stealth check it's built in a way that's almost smooth entirely of the top like the construction-- 29 okay so you empty the rest of the yellow vial on the other side you can see the actual metal-- the area where you dip it the kind of yellowish liquid hits this kind of smooth shiny bronze color and the leftover material is this like thick horrible dark green color the way the two mix and dissolve you empty the last of the vial and the other beam gets about halfway dissolved through before eventually the last of it's used up all right as he releases it this rod is now stuck in mid-air anchored permanently until removed by a click in that position okay make a stealth check all right so you've dissolved a portion of the two metal beams on each side you guys have a mouse kind of tied to an arrow what's the plan okay you understand the spell heat metal is less of a localized damaging the metal what it does is just causes a metal structure to in itself become hot you would not be able to necessarily damage the metal with it what you would do is you'd be able to weaken it universally possibly with enough heat it's not like a blowtorch or anything so you're attempting to pop kima looks there and says at a certain height i imagine it would work the fomorian you imagine probably weighs oof i'd say three to five tons i'd say about three tons investigation check looking at the sections of the beams that you've damaged the thickness of the plane and the metal bars the part where they attached-- you're not getting a full view 'cause you're not actually looking in the room yet everyone's avoided looking in the room at this point but you gather with enough speed and enough weight this thing would break and hinge pretty easily so tiberius on the carpet tiberius you take the mouse in your hand and for a second it's adorable until the smell hits you you all sit around the edge like keeping out of view you can see a little bit of faint light coming through the glass as the general green glow that permeates the circumstance tiberius slowly lifts up-- okay as you get overhead tiberius you get the first look into this room as you glance down inside you see immediately in the center of the room the giant brass structure coming to a point above the elder brain in the center of the room on the elevated platforms you see there are two caged sections of the room that contain two kind of flesh skinless altered creatures that have been subjected to serious tortures by k'varn k'varn floats off in the distance by what looks like some sort of experimentation table containing glass vials and strange metallic structures right here but first we are gonna go ahead and find-- all right so everyone we'll say the group is for the most part up here there is a flying bear up here they are working on this side it would essentially hinge this way as you glide up tiberius far above looking down into this all right is there any other preparatory spells that want to be cast at this moment you wanna give inspiration to people do you wanna cast any spells you are welcome to look over into the glass if you'd like all right so that's a d10 you can do that up to four people d10 inspiration die for you either an attack a saving throw-- i'd recommend saving throw that's an inspiration dice to you and-- a d10 and vax vax a d10 inspiration to you as well keep track of those guys these are the only ones you get from the bard this game because he used them up front buff spells that want to be cast at this point in time pike any buff spells you wanna put on okay is grog the only one you want to cast it on yeah it's not concentration as many fourth-level spell as you have you can cast it on different people it lasts for eight hours as many 4th-level spells as you have it's one person per cast okay you cast blur on yourself vax vax okay so death ward mark that death ward on both you guys keep that in mind i am not gonna keep track of that for you it means next time you go to zero hit points it brings you to one then it's gone all right guys you cast blur on yourself hold out the mouse aim okay as the mouse descends out of the middle of the air the fomorian goes tumbling down angrily cascading towards it with a deafening crash sound the fomorian goes slamming into the glass you hear the cracking and crashing sound of the planes as they shatter the metal structure-- this horrible breaking bending sound as they bend inward and slam the inside of the temple the fomorian who's streaking down slams into the ground from that height taking-- at that height he is dead even at his hit point level he is right there on the ground so as that happens the entire structure tilts to the side part of it bends and kinda hits the side of the temple and whatever strange green glow was at the top of the temple dissipates all right you're way up here right now start making your way down all right everyone roll initiative because k'varn turns around immediately and you hear this very familiar deep voice echoing from within the chamber naughty naughty i left the door open for you everyone roll initiative all right so go ahead and-- we have 25 to 20 guys 20 to 15 19 all right 15 to ten ten to five what'd you roll pike what'd you get pike seven oh man that was-- no no that was a kima going last all right grog you're up first you don't know it's your turn most everyone's behind you technically so you land there all right kind of swing around you end up in that area there you're-- ugh it's hard to hide you yeah he's already landed so that's your movement you've landed you can see now the giant beholder standing with his metal plates kind of haphazardly bolted onto its body and a giant horn curving upward in front the eye focuses on you its pale blue color looking at you with a menacing anger the strange sense of joy and playfulness it's awful to behold that's all you're doing your turn certainly try certainly try that tiberius you are coming down as fast as you can on the carpet you get about halfway to the top of the temple with your turn vax yeah that's using your whole round to just fly down with the carpet okay at this distance you are at disadvantage on the attacks 'cause it's too far away so go ahead and-- 16 misses 21 hits 17 misses all right you do attack before he does this turn does that do something with an assassin right yeah it's not a surprise you kind of blew the surprise with the giant fomorian crashing through the top so you have one dagger that hit okay all right he is currently poisoned all right that ends your turn all right that brings us to vex all right hunter's mark is on k'varn okay so you pull your arrow your hands shaking slightly as you see this creature now focusing its attention on grog below you pull out the arrow you focus your magical energy the shaft of the arrow you know juts out all these different thorns and you release it below go ahead and roll your attack 29 hits are you doing a secondary attack go ahead and roll your secondary attack now just to get it out of the way all right you can 23 hits so as you release the first arrow you fire the second one you pull back and the shaking in the hand is too intense and as you're about to release it pike reaches up and touches your shoulder with her hand and you can feel the surge of sarenrae guide your arrow your hand straightens and your arrow strikes true to k'varn go ahead and roll damage for both all righty the damage right 18 okay yeah your bracers give you plus two to all those damage rolls 19 he is currently bleeding gotcha keep that in mind it's currently hanging right now seemingly disabled all right that ends your turn vex you step back it's a five-foot space you're having to like lean and as you look back like it's a long slope okay all right so k'varn starts k'varn's turn k'varn now with like the poison coursing through its body kind of just looks about and kind of shakes for a second the eye stalks kind of looking in different directions and just goes (laughs) i want to play and begins to drift up into the air k'varn moves up at which point you guys who were ducking down off to the side k'varn comes into sight as he drifts up towards the top no it's at this angle right here it's basically kind of following the temple ceiling there so first things first it's going to fire its first ray all right so one of the eyes whips around it aims at-- let's see this would be at percy percy go ahead and make a wisdom-- no this would be a dexterity saving throw 24 you manage to just duck out of the way as this kind of whitish-gray beam of energy goes (tsch) and shoots out from the top of the temple a secondary ray-- all right secondary ray is going to go ahead and fire at-- (sighs) pike another beam of-- another beam shoots out go ahead and make a strength saving throw 12 yeah you can add your inspiration dice to a saving throw if you'd like up to you all right so it's a 12 plus a d10 go ahead and roll a d10 a 14 so as you bring your shield up to defend this strange kind of grayish-green ray slams into you and you feel weightless for a moment as all of a sudden you're lifted off your feet and carried down into the chamber floating restrained unable to move and you're just kind of floating in midair right there right now and then the beam releases you go ahead and make an athletics check with disadvantage 'cause you're in heavy mail acrobatics technically sorry my fault four all right all right you take 23 points of damage as you plummet slamming on your back on the ground and you're currently prone the third ray-- all right the third ray streaks up and is going to slam into you vax go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw 24 you see this deep bluish ray come shooting up towards you you pull out of the way and it slams into a part of the broken metal that's left over as it hits the metal you see the metal turn to stone you manage to just pull out of the way of the blast that's going to end k'varn's turn that brings us to clarota lifts off-- to hover down into the other-- gets to about-- we'll say for the purposes of this just for-- 'cause i don't have enough things to put up here we'll say clarota eventually-- at his turn-- float from the bottom we'll say we'll say nearby over here the face-- he's going to go into the mind blast okay as clarota lands next to it grabs the side of its head and attempts to mind blast as a cone in front k'varn just turns and laughs in clarota's face (laughs) your kind has tried so many times big old toothy grin pulls across the front of the beholder that ends clarota's turn percy you're up correct oh the one that knocks him prone the wing shot i would say that would cause him to plummet a little bit not necessarily due to the nature you could lower his current position in the room but his floating nature wouldn't allow him to necessarily take a lot of damage from that all right okay okay okay will hit the poison has worn off k'varn is still bleeding currently so how many damage for that since the rays automatically hit i'll consider that those who get hit by the rays will have advantage on their saving throw okay the outside over here okay we'll say you're over there all right that ends your turn percy keyleth you're up i'd say at this distance it's about a good 50 feet at an angle what are you doing you're not on the carpet with tiberius you're on the edge of the platform tiberius is up here there you go athletics check first okay all right so you leap off and swan dive-- all right go ahead and make a grapple check roll athletics again with the earth elemental's strength yes all right that would be a strength of 20 so it's a plus five to the roll for the athletics check what is that okay all right so you grapple onto k'varn holding onto his form k'varn is dragged not entirely to the ground but is reduced to about that height so you drag k'varn now down to just about like a ten-foot height and is currently grappled on as k'varn is like (grunts) pike it's your turn yeah you're prone on the ground so you might want to get up yeah you use it once and you can't use it again for the rest of the day that's your action you ask what kind of intervention you want what kind of aid you want and then i decide how that functions all right okay what's sacred flame do flame strike that's a horse of a different color all right so 5th-level flame strike coming out a ten-foot radius and a 40-foot high platform where are you creating it what are you doing pike what are you doing guiding bolt all right guiding bolt level one guiding bolt all right make a ranged spell attack against k'varn it is at a disadvantage because k'varn is currently grappled you rolled twice take the lower one it's a 15 still total of 15 so you rolled a 15 and what's your spell attack your spell page that does hit all right so on a hit the target takes 4d6 radiant damage and the next attack roll made against it has advantage so go ahead and roll 4d6 16 damage all right so the next attack on him is at advantage as a reaction he's going to use one of his legendary actions on its turn to-- as it gets hit and dazed-- one of its eyestalks bends over again the same one that hit you last time is going to attempt hit you again go ahead and make a strength saving throw again 14 the ray slams into you again and you feel yourself lift off your feet as the beam throws you across the room slamming into the bars on the side as you hit them the impact doesn't do enough damage but suddenly these two giant fleshy arms reach through the bars and grab you and pull you against them you take-- nine points of crushing damage yes and you are currently grappled and held against the bars that ends the legendary action and i think you've used your movement to get up that's your turn that gets us to scanlan so scanlan as you hold over the edge you look down and you pull out the scroll and begin reading it hopefully the arcane language will come to you bits of it seem familiar i need you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add your ability modifier which is five ten plus five the difficulty is 15 as you finish muttering the spell the actual scroll disappears in your hand and bursts into this strange array of purple color that then coalesces and releases with such force that you're nearly blown off the top of the temple a bolt of energy shoots out slams into k'varn-- i'm gonna look up chain lightning here 10d8 lightning damage k'varn does make saving throw so it's half damage 24 sam and 44 okay half that is 22 damage to k'varn i will say you choose the targets oh not targets it's as many as three other targets you can choose not to affect your allies on this but you must be within 30 feet of the target which yeah both of those would be yeah if you want all right okay 22 damage to that guy and 44 to him he does not make his saving throw he's looking pretty rough all right this brings it-- that the end of your turn and a move no unless it says it's a bonus action all right kima runs around to where you're on the side grabs the rope from you and says i need to do what my destiny tells me to takes the rope and rappels down lands there she is going to go ahead and use her action-- if i get into combat-- she's going to cast aura of vitality on herself which allows her as a bonus action to heal allies within 30 feet of her and pike's within-- over there she casts the spell grabbing her holy symbol this white light consumes her body for a second and creates this kind of gentle 30-foot radial area of divine energy and she looks over at you go ahead and-- you heal eight points of damage no just-- she can choose one person per turn all right that finishes kima's turn at the top grog you're up pike is still being grappled yes you won't know until you get there it's kind of hard to tell he's ten feet up you're 8'7 with a great axe you can reach 27 hits yeah roll the attacks now 22 hits hits to the ground 21 each of those attacks is reduced by one because your axe is currently not magical in the front of his anti-magic cone i got those numbers for you you already-- those were three strikes oh it's 20-- sorry i heard twenty-- 21 29 17 sorry so that was-- the first attack was 20-- 39 13 okay gotcha okay cool all right that brings us to the end of your turn tiberius you just now get using your full turn you can get to where everyone else is it's not your speed it's the speed of the carpet the carpet moves at a consistent speed okay okay so you'll be hanging over there all right that brings us to vax there is one rope currently that is attached to the immovable rod yes you are about 50 feet up right now okay so you grab the rope leap out in that direction catching yourself at 25 feet that's going to be your movement for this whole thing so you reach up you grab it go ahead and make an athletics check as you leap off the platform one of the ropes in your hand your fingers clutch the rope and you can feel the pain as the rope-burn burns through your gloves but you still hit that point in time where you latch on at the perfect moment for a second you look right into the face of k'varn swing back and then come forward again straight towards-- remember your daggers right now are not magical your daggers are not magical that hits all right that wasn't your hit that was your attack that was your-- all right 14 does not hit no all right you are like now on the rope on the end of a front swing holding onto it as its final lair-- final legendary action this turn as you slam into it with the sneak attack your dagger pulls out as the rope begins pulling you backward one of the rays turns to you i need you to go ahead and-- let me roll here all right go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw total 20 all right you-- the kind of pinkish ray slams into your side and you feel for a second the entire room's color shift as if all of your allies turn red for a second and anger fills your body and you shrug it off you feel the color fade as your backswing pulls you back kind of floating right in the middle there put you there for the time being all right that brings us to vex all right you have disadvantage on this attack 'cause you have an earth elemental currently clutching-- 19 just hits all righty nice okay what was that that's gonna miss so as the first arrow slams into it sprays off and manages to pierce the side that doesn't impact clarota or your druid second arrow splinters off the inside of the temple room all right yeah if you want technically if you're still maintaining concentration on that no no you cast blur so he's no longer flying yep okay trinket's already ducking all right that brings us to k'varn's turn k'varn takes ten damage from the bleed poison wore off all right so so let me see what was-- what effect is giving him disadvantage right from your head shot awesome all right so the first thing he's going-- all right so one beam turns around and sprays this pitch-black ray that careens across the room this one is going to slam into-- let's see where it goes all right that's going to hit percy it arcs up i need you to go ahead and make a--- cover unfortunately for these doesn't make a difference rays are magical instant need you to make a dexterity saving throw with advantage yeah you manage to pull out of the way a secondary ray that's black as well but seems to be just pinned with shadow that is pulled out of the air around it actually gives off this strange buzzing sound as it (vrrrrr) across the room it's going to go for grog grog i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw with advantage saving throw at the top of your-- 15 you try and move out of the way but the beam hits you on the side of your torso you feel a familiar sensation back when that proto-lich was drawing the life force from you from the phylactery that was sewn in your chest i need you-- nope you take 55 points of damage all right and this time a pale greenish ray comes streaking across this one's going to be aimed at scanlan go ahead and make a dexterity save with advantage 18 that's true yeah so you duck out of the way and the beam just (shhh) past you as it hits part of the stone nearby you wherever the beam hits the stone the stone is just no longer there it's like it just carved through it very similar to what queen ulara did to the top of the throne room as movement k'varn's going to try and break your grapple go ahead and make another athletics check keyleth athletics check roll plus five roll plus five d20 plus five 15 k'varn pushes you off you lose your grip and fall onto your feet but onto the ground there k'varn then goes-- no no that's only for your saving throws k'varn is then going to go ahead and glide back up no actually it's going to be like that that is going to end k'varn's turn k'varn saves against the bleed is no longer bleeding and he just starts laughing (laughs) as you see like black energy seeping in around and you can see visible wounds that grog has left are slowly stitching that brings us to clarota who is still kind of hovering in levitation clarota comes to the ground and lands looks up the tentacles pull back brings one hand down and the arcane sigils you've seen appear on the hands both light up and then releases a bolt of lightning energy up into the air towards k'varn okay k'varn does make his dexterity saving throw takes half-damage on that that is 18 points of lightning damage and he's going to move back to there at the end of clarota's turn legendary action he's going to use the secondary ray the ray is going to be-- all right streaming up towards the top again scanlan i need you to go ahead and make a strength saving throw three rays on its turn and then it gets to make three individual ray attacks on other people's turns advantage until your next turn unfortunately it isn't an attack roll with advantage so a familiar beam streaks up kind of a deep green color slams into you and you feel yourself chucked off the top restrained and then pulled down with severe force into the center of the temple and then the beam releases you you go slamming into the ground go ahead and make an acrobatics roll you have advantage because of your dexterity 19 okay you manage to reduce the damage from the fall somewhat you suffer 11 points of damage managing to land harshly on one knee and foot you feel that's going to suck in the morning that ends clarota's turn percy you're up okay 29 to hit okay no you do not all right good i should have done this last round by the way as a point i need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw you are firing a bad news on a small five-foot platform on top of a temple there is kickback on this i'm just keeping tabs on this constitution save to hold your footing because that is a big loud powerful kickback blast 17 it blows you back but you manage to keep your foot from going over the edge keep your footing at the top and reload with your second attack all right percy you going to stay where you are or going to move all right okay okay grog's turn doesn't come for a while for the next round of combat so you would throw grog and then grog would come back down grog is just now coming off this series of frenzied attacks so you would-- no unfortunately it's just out of reach hold your turn all right 'til grog's all right keyleth out of the line back to the top of the next round pike you're up you're currently (grunts) you can yeah you just can't move as a movement you can break the grapple if you want to make an athletics check with disadvantage because you're in plate mail holds on to you and you take three points of crushing damage as the arms are still pulling you against the top it rolled really poorly you still have one action and a bonus action should you choose to use them all right 3d8 plus five 20 20 hit points to six creatures in a 30-foot radius so you can get grog scanlan keyleth centered on that point to each target-- i'd say you can do it on yourself yeah so 20 hit points to grog to scanlan to keyleth no she heals you if you're full you're fine all right i think that's your turn pike scanlan you're up you're currently face-down on the ground or no sorry you're on like your hurt knee you're not prone you manage to catch yourself up all righty let's go ahead and pull this up real fast how does the-- what's the effect on that one this is the forceful hand clenched fist all right so go ahead and make a melee attack with your game statistics so go ahead and roll d20 add your strength modifier and your proficiency modifier ten total of ten all right a fist swings down what you notice is the fist swings or swings upward sorry at k'varn who's kind of loosely facing your direction the fist crosses the front of his cone and dissipates the spell is nullified you roll for it all right great that comes to kima's turn kima who's now landed and cast that spell on her is going to go ahead and use an ability called sacred weapon she pulls out the hammer and as she brings her hand across it this divine flame begins to burn around the base of where she's holding it and the giant head of the maul she steps forward to there actually going to move to the side a little bit there that's going to be her turn she shouts out someone bring it down brings to the top of the round grog and keyleth all right athletics check actually no this is a strength check so just roll and add five to it 15 600 pounds-- right i know i would say you go ahead and roll a strength check as well as you're also pushing off of her 22 between him pushing off the force of your hands you manage to move over leap in the air approximately at his height before you plummet what are you going to do all right you reach out go ahead and make an athletics check you grab onto the horn and you're dangling from it right now ugh you can feel just to the touch of your hand there's this freezing cold sensation as you look up you can see frost beginning to build around the outside of your fingers it's immediate frostburn on your fingers but you're holding tight and you have this giant eye moving in front of you rapidly looking around angrily this giant toothy maw just behind you with a tongue lashing about and this voice right in your face going oh you don't wanna do that boy that's your action what's your bonus action you can certainly try strength check no you can do it now before you know what the answer would be add 1d10 to the roll 16 you grab you take your feet and you kick off the front that thing is wedged in there your body comes back flat against the beholder you see the eyelid has been closed from the impact of your feet and this horrible snarling sound what are you doing so that's your turn at the end of your turn it's going to go ahead and do another lair-- lair action on you because you're in its face i'm going to say it would give him advantage however that's negated by him so you just have a straight roll on this i want you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw 19 damn for a second you feel like the force of k'varn's mind begins to creep over yours and you feel the urge to suddenly turn to his side you shrug it off out of just the general fury and anger realizing that you wouldn't matter being raging are immune to charm effects all right that ends your turn tiberius still over here yeah go ahead and make a perception check 20 all right looking down you look about the city streets and what you can see is immediately a swarm of illithids and mind flayers heading towards the temple all right okay hold on one turn all right so to get to the bottom of the-- you get 20 feet away you said which is you get about that far at the end of this turn with the magic carpet so you're about there i'd say on the outside so you then-- you jump off the carpet you turn you cast fly on yourself you don't know that yet you imagine you're out in the open but you don't know if anyone's noticed you yet right but you can only move so fast on the carpet you come down to the bottom of-- no you can't just like grab the carpet and go down you have to jump off the carpet leaving the carpet behind it's a really really-- it's not like a boop it's a six it's a 15-foot-by-10-foot carpet it's very thick okay just letting you know you're pretty much going to have to let the carpet go or take it down slower so as you coast down you get to about this point you said you cast fly on yourself or are you just going to go for the alter self okay all right you're now in the form of a mind flayer covered in rags with a big old metallic head piece as you coast down you can see a group of what looks like three mind flayers with about seven slaves swarming in towards the front of the temple they haven't quite noticed you yet about 30 feet from you they all stop and look up at you a look of confusion as mind flayers both do not speak through language let alone speak common out loud you make a persuasion roll wait what'd you say 20 plus ten plus nine okay there's-- no there's a really really really fine line here two of them kind of look at each other confused and look back third one looks up at you and just continues inside the temple you didn't get mind blasted three times no that's your turn yo all right vax you're up you mean k'varn all right with disadvantage on both those attacks because you currently have grog dangling from the creature that does hit correct yep dagger slams into the bottom because you're out of the eye range returns to your side end of your turn it's going to use legendary action final ray all right this stalk now gives off this weird yellowish-- like a very faint yellowish see-through color kind of scoops across the ground right past you after you throw the dagger go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw it has stalks everywhere these stalks aim down constitution saving throw you have advantage because percy-- 18 all right you manage to just dodge out of the way it crests your arm and for a second you feel the muscles tense up and then you just shake off the effect all right that brings us to vex okay make an attack with disadvantage total 20 okay that hits essentially how it works is it works like a tanglefoot bag it slams into it you roll damage for the arrow and it bursts over him like a giant package of globby thick glue just (pfft) 19 damage all right it looks a little goopy the purpose of the tanglefoot bag usually is to stick something to something like a creature on the ground so he's got goop on him doesn't seem to be affecting him much you wanna fire another arrow oh i thought this was the tanglefoot arrow okay then given that circumstance the bolo wraps around him bolos-- bolos are used to trap creature's legs when they're running wrap around it they kind of fall over it wraps around some of the eyestalks or parts and doesn't seem to have an additional effect than the damage unfortunately it's just-- bolo against beholder it's kind of a square peg in a hole all right okay all right gotcha cool as the arrow streaks and then slams into his side you see the burst of flame begin to burn up its side and you can see now the armored plates on the side of k'varn some are starting to like creak off and kind of peel off at the side the damage is starting to have a visual impact on k'varn you can see there's bits of beholder blood beginning to pour down the side of its meatball-like torso is that the end of your turn that brings it to k'varn's turn k'varn is going to attempt to shrug you off the horn grog first it's going to fly up unfortunately right now no make an athletics check 15 k'varn nudges you a sheer bit of force your hand lets go and you plummet backward again slamming into the ground make an acrobatics check to try and reduce the damage if you like all right you go ahead and slam into the ground you manage to reduce the damage somewhat but your back cracks into the part of stone that raises up over the platform you unfortunately you reduce the damage somewhat but you still end up taking 14 points of damage from the impact and you are prone that was k'varn's movement now k'varn is going to go ahead and fire three additional rays all right the kind of pinkish-red ray streaks across and is going to slam into you go ahead and make your saving throw it's going to be a wisdom saving throw with advantage 21 the beam comes across hits you in the shoulder kind of goes across the front of your chest for a moment you feel this kind of bloodthirsty urge fill you and you just wince and feel it wash over your body all right the second ray reroll that all right the second one is going to go ahead and streak down towards grog grog i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity check with i'll say disadvantage 'cause you're on the ground sure so it'd be just a regular roll five all right that was his first roll regular roll yeah all right all right grog you take 61 points of damage as the black ray that is carrying that heavy aura of shadow just beams into the ground slamming into your torso second ray into grog he touched the horn and really pissed it off all right go ahead and make a constitution saving throw grog 13 a secondary beam this one like a deep reddish-brown color slams into your torso you take 36 points of necrotic damage all right so as the beam is about to blast your body into severe shock you feel that surge of sarenrae's energy guide over you and pull back with one hit point left k'varn frustrated looks down at you with your eyes still open and goes no 22 all right go ahead and make a strength saving throw grog the ray slams into your body you can see the telekinesis beam trying to move you but for the moment you're just too heavy (laughter) 14 points of lightning damage against k'varn at the end of clarota's turn k'varn's going to use a legendary action to fire another beam at grog yeah all the beams automatically hit go ahead and make another dexterity saving throw 18 that same fuzzing black ray comes back again for a second streak slamming into you as it hits you you feel this sucking cold sensation as the soul is pulled from your body lifeless on the ground the light left grog's eyes laying slain on the floor of the temple as that necrotic energy kind of drifts off of grog it pulls into the horn and k'varn you notice the wounds begin to seal up a little bit and a chuckle comes out who's next percy you're up yes very possible okay bad news aimed up you're aiming-- you're probably going to have to move around to this side which is very careful around the two of them-- oh actually you'd probably go around this side yeah so you make your way to here you kneel down with the bad news you aim for one of the weak points of the metal bent and ruined from the swinging of the platform you grabbed that horn grog 17 does not hit oh no no i was thinking of his ac that hits the platform i'm so dumb yes that does hit go ahead and roll damage 15 points of damage go ahead and make a constitution save as the blast of the bad news threatens to push you back keeping your low stance you keep yourself with strain on the top the blast hits the side of the metal the metal streaks and breaks and snaps the single bit of the contraption swings widely slamming into the side of k'varn k'varn does not make his dexterity saving throw k'varn takes 36 points of damage the blast of the arcane nature of the contraption and the impact from-- it slams into him pushing him all the way to the side over here so leaving you right where you were there and you can see now part of the metal armor has completely been destroyed by the impact so the ac actually lowers for k'varn and he's looking pretty rough oh you mean the action surge okay 'cause you used your second attack to reload you-- unfortunately from your position since it slammed in this direction you don't have eyesight on him unless he's considered having cover right now to move around the whole platform yeah you would have had to you can still fire but he'll have three-quarters cover then fucking fire okay that hits 18 points of damage all right that's so obnoxious all right that's percy's turn pike you're up you can try to go ahead and-- you have to try and break the-- that's right 'cause the grapple guy got hit all right yeah so you can go do that move over to grog 11 technically okay so as you reach over you grab your holy symbol which looking down at it you can see that crack is still ominously in the symbol but you reach down you pray to sarenrae to aid you huh you reach down and touch grog and his cold still body-- you feel the divine energy begin to instill his form i need you to go ahead and make a wisdom check yes you do from which one from gnome's cunning for her racial background she chooses-- she's a deep gnome 16 look that up really fast deep gnome rock gnome okay gnome cunning is you have advantage on all saving throws against magic this was a check 16 okay as you put your hands in you feel this surge of warmth and some of the coldness in the air is pulled back in as grog's chest rises up with breath once again grog the darkness fades and your eyes come clear you're looking up on your back into the room you're at one hit point i'm pretty sure for revivify but you're alive he's right there i'd say yeah you can do that superior is-- is 8d4 plus eight that'll do what's the amount what you got 25 all right go all right at the end of your turn pike k'varn is angrily going to use a legendary action to go ahead and fire another beam at you since you went ahead and healed him up all right go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw taliesin and 19 you manage to dodge out of the way before it hits the stone around you carving just past grog no effect however where it hits the stone you can see the stone is carved in this giant groove like the beam itself is like a giant welding torch that ends your turn scanlan you are down here he's not currently really looking at-- actually no he was looking down at them so it's that-- so yeah you'd be in the current cone you would have to move you're currently in his eyesight yeah all right all right that is a 20 what is your dc what's the dc of your spell he rolled a 20 yes as you release the spell the eyestalks turn and you can see the darkness that normally fades over the eyes just gloss over and dissipate all right it's now kima's turn kima's going to hold off looks over at keyleth and says if you can give me another one of those tosses like you gave grog kima holds back at the top of the round all right go ahead make an athletics check yeah add five to the d20 roll 23 all right you send kima flying in the air maul arcing through the sky as she arcs the mark above her a giant flash of divine energy just kind of sparks in-- is left behind her like a giant trail through the sky she brings the hammer down towards k'varn that is a 21 that hits as she slams into it kima-- go ahead and throw-- is going to go ahead and throw a 3rd-level spell into divine smite doing an additional 3d8 damage on top of that that'll be 38 points of divine damage slamming into the side knocking teeth out you can see now portions of the eye starting to swell k'varn's looking pretty rough kima however just continues to go and attempts to land-- does not make the athletics check and takes-- okay that'll be 22 points of damage from the fall and is prone but is happy with the damage that she dealt grog it's your turn you are yes you can that's your movement to get up yeah he's kind of looking in that direction not directly down at you you're just on the cusp of it yeah you can technically no put it this way since you stood up you're now like cusping in the cone-- the anti-magic cone any potions drank in that area will have no effect magic the actual potions are dispelled all right go ahead and roll to attack as you reach back you lob the axe the chain of returning now also in the cone of anti-magic just snaps off the axe the axe goes flying across the room clattering to the ground underneath the corner over here tiberius okay so you head down towards the base of the temple okay i mean you're visible up here you can see him he can see you he's kind of looking in this direction right now okay go ahead and make the check for telekinesis okay so as you release the telekinesis you pull and pull but that horn is definitively locked in place stalks okay go ahead make another check okay 29 all right so as you pull one of the eye stalks gets flung off the body and you can see this like spurt of brackish blood that spills across the area nearby go ahead and roll 3d6 yep four damage all right tiberius ends your turn okay vex you're up oh yeah vax is first sorry go ahead correct (mouths) thank you for your patience boss battle i was thanking them for their patience 26 hits you are not all right that's your last luck point by the way that was three all right all right all right so you chuck the daggers up they kind of cascade off one of them manages to slam into the side you pull them back to your belt and get ready for the next round vex you're up 14 unfortunately no it hits the side of the wall explodes sending a series of wooden spikes into the stone on the side of the temple you used flaming bow twice already so you no longer can use it 23 hits go and roll damage with your hunter's mark 20 points of damage all right how do you want to do this (cheering) no (laughter) all right so as k'varn's looking around kind of frantic at this point realizing that this whole swarm of individuals are pouring into the temple that looking around you can sense that the-- it's lost control of the elder brain it starts just getting extremely manic and-- another ray of energy it glances up at you just in time for you to release that final arrow it strikes down going right into the pupil the light blue color immediately bursts into an angry red as the eye closes over trying to contain the impact the blood begins to pour out of the front of the eye as the arrow you can see pierce out the back side and is jutting about six inches out the back of the beholder and k'varn slowly sinks a few feet and just slams onto the ground that ends your turn vex okay so on k'varn's turn black energy begins to pull into the horn and the beholder opens the eye again now the light blue color is just a pale white and you can see the jaw's a little slack but the horn is now glowing this intense black color and the beholder gets back up from his position at which kima's on the ground says shit orcus god of undeath of course and she's going to start getting ready on her end k'varn's going to take another ray attack at-- let's see so a dexterity save against-- this would be kima on the ground kima fails kima's form begins to slowly turn to stone her body's like--secondary one is-- i rolled that one all right can i get a wisdom saving throw from you vax with advantage a wave of fear hits your mind for a second watching it rise up but you've seen many horrible things and it's not enough to shake your will and resolve third one all right can i get a dexterity saving throw this will be from you pike as a dull green ray fires out from the currently undead k'varn you take 45 points of damage you're still conscious good (laughs) clarota is going to run forward and attempt to to use his tentacles on k'varn that's an 18 that hits that's 15 points of psychic damage and is now trying to grapple the tentacles around the front of k'varn-- the side of k'varn's head that brings us to percy all right at the horn all right this is going to be at disadvantage because you're-- because you're on the carpet flying down making a specific shot at a very very tiny object 18 against the horn unfortunately will not hit i know you-- the carpet kind of juts back for a second the shot just ricochets off a few walls you can see a bit of stone getting knocked off the side end of your turn all right pike all right so you're using your action to call on divine intervention how do you want to call your deity it doesn't need to be anything too specific it'd be just to aid me whatever you feel like you grab your holy symbol what do you shout out to sarenrae go ahead and roll 2d10 go ahead and-- so roll the first one the second one so at this depth sarenrae's influence is a little too far away to come into this moment and you feel the intervention isn't quite strong enough to really make her presence known at this point but you feel a sense of warmth and comfort knowing that at least she's looking over you but thinks you don't need my aid at this moment so that's your action move bonus action i believe that's-- i think that's an action unfortunately okay go for it heal yourself on that that brings us to scanlan okay all right all right lightning at what level it is level three normally i think lightning bolt is level three okay so that'll be 9d6 does make his saving throw 25 so 13 points of lightning damage the side of k'varn's undead form you can see part of the flesh is now blown off the side hanging limply part of the teeth on the inside of the mouth are now visible it's still standing held together by the power of the horn all right kima and keyleth kima is going to stand up unfortunately because she was prone that kind of takes her turn yes what are you doing it's currently dangling right here right above you precariously you can certainly try it looks very heavy yeah the process of doing that will probably take out a few other people all right go for it go ahead and make an athletics check nine yeah no you just go to reach and the beholder just pushes you off that ends your turn kima turns to solid stone locked in place grog you have no axe here you can get to its side over here maybe all right you rush over as you pass by this creature steps forward and is going to attempt to grapple you through the bars that's going to be a 14 go ahead and roll athletics you take seven points of crushing damage and are currently grappled no you take seven you're grappled you're still next to k'varn you just can't move any further if you want to yeah okay you can do that with your bonus action all right go for it 17 does not hit that does hit then roll 2d6 for the damage plus your strength modifier 15 damage all right you slice through part of its body you can see now three stalks slide off and you can see some of the brain tissue underneath but yet its still-necrotic form is holding it in place that ends your turn who's next tiberius it has probably nine yeah covered in stalks dude looking really rough though he's right here all right all right that's a dexterity save right okay that's 19 makes the dexterity save go ahead and roll damage takes half damage 40 so half that is 20 damage how do you want to do this (cheering) what are you going to do with your glacial blast okay so you take your arcane form and you can see where the impact of the arrow left behind from vex is already still there and the eye's kind of slightly concave as the wound's open you take the glacial blast into one giant jagged piece of ice and you thrust it forward with all your arcane might it hits and sinks into the eye and as it streaks to the inside it bursts from the interior you see ice shards piercing it from the inside out as the form kind of lands on the ground there as ice begins to slowly form and crackle around its outside you can still see dark energy pulling into the horn how many sorcery points do you have all right go ahead and make your roll 26 with a sickening tearing sound you notice the shaking of the horn begin to slowly pull from the slightly dilapidated and decomposing form of k'varn as the horn begins to tug and tear the flesh stretches before eventually it's torn from the body the moment the horn rises up all that black energy dissipates the horn held aloft in mid-air the rest of k'varn's form slumps to the ground and slowly begins to melt away just slam over its head okay so as k'varn's horn is now currently held aloft via your telekinesis-- that ends your turn it looks like currently the battle for the moment-- is held as you guys sit here in the center of the temple look about you the contraption destroyed the loose pale pulsing glow of the elder brain slowly glowing brighter and brighter okay all right holy shit guys you did have a death but you had a spell to bring him back that was a marathon session thank you all for your patience thanks for staying fantastic you guys-- between your head shots-- -- were mvp on that battle the setup of
