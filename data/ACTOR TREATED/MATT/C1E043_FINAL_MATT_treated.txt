every one of you hey see anything else cool we're good all right let's dive into tonight's episode proper so last we left off the party vox machina having recently suffered their main city of emon and one of their initial towns where they began their adventures in westruun under attack from an entity called the chroma conclave a collection of allied chromatic dragons extremely powerful ancient across the board it seems is wreaking havoc across all of tal'dorei they managed to save a few allies make a few current tenuous relationships with the clasp and moved all of the refugees that they had been keeping within greyskull keep to whitestone to keep them safe for the time being as that town had seemingly been passed over by the dragons that are still heading east across the continent after that the party made their way to vasselheim vasselheim the distant city known as the cradle of faith the oldest living beacon of civilization in the world that is currently known after making their way there the party made their way into the guild of the slayer's take where they had previously signed on after a trial and are members of to seek more allies throughout the city of vasselheim in hopes of preparing themselves to retake emon possibly tal'dorei at some point in the near future that is where we left off as you guys have spent some time resting within the actual-- we've got whispers going around over here already and we haven't started okay two can play at that game so as you guys take a little bit of time getting reacquainted with the guild hall of the slayer's take setting your stuff down that you need to prepare for a short period of time staying in the city or longer if need be you ran briefly into mertin cyndrial the husband of vanessa who's the huntmaster of the entire guild and had a brief conversation with aldor who was beating thorbir at cards he's a nice fella there you go not very good with dice so that being the case what would you guys like to do at this point in time you just arrived now it's mid-dayish at this point early morning to mid-day you haven't slept you've arrived it's like morning mid-day now you've just situated yourselves in the guild you had an evening's rest before you came here but you have used your 7th-level spell to get here so what is the plan last i heard victor was blown apart you don't know you've purchased them in the past remember that's where grog had his fantastic bartering skills last time to acquire a few potions yeah so you guys are going to head towards the-- all right as you guys heads towards the front door of the slayer's take guild hall you're but feet from it before the door slams open as the cold winter wind comes pouring in there standing in the doorway you see the outer frame of a strong female form dark brownish-black leathers you can see tousled dark hair piercing pupil-less eyes and there stands huntmaster vanessa clutching a bag that's seemingly dampened at its base in her right hand as she steps into the main foyer looking about all of you gathered in the front area well isn't this a nice surprise in the middle of the morning ah a pleasure to see you all ah hold on the rest of you inside where it's warmer and as she steps inside you see two individuals step out of the shadows behind her one of which is another tiefling female white hair red in skin and another individual familiar to some of you human short brown shoulder-length hair series of scars across his arm carrying a shield and spear as kashaw and zahra come in to accompany-- at which point vanessa groans staring at this display i hope this has worked out well for all of you i however have a bit of business of ours to finish okay she walks up to the table where mertin's standing he reaches out to greet her with arms extended she throws it into his arms he catches it pulls it open you see within there is a head of what looks like a humanoid head but the skin is greyish and featureless the eyes are whitish and milky what hair is there in wisps is white in color who here is trained in arcana you know what this is roll an arcana check 21 this is the head of a doppelganger this is a creature that spends a lot of its time infiltrating society being able to take the form and shape of other individuals to assume their position to take their wealth to do all sorts of sometimes interesting or dastardly things yep well turn it in for the money it's worth spread the change and forget about it well this is for me to worry about not for you to care yes please generally somebody will eventually be paying for such a creature to be hunted so i do not feel the necessity to do it without-- then i think it should be very easy to convince someone to pay for it well i imagine that would be quite a terrible thing vanessa's crossed her arms and thinks for a second and she goes ah if what you say is true this is very unfortunate and a bit larger than what our simple guild could even hope to really help this would be something to take to the various temples well let me put it this way if what you say is true multiple incredibly powerful ancient dragons roaming destroying-- this is not something you can throw yourself at until eventually one or the other falls you have to find a weakness you have to find the way to be on their level ask around see what other allies you can find (sighs) i am huntmaster of the slayer's take i deal in contracts i deal in business i deal in the hunting of relatively unorganized creatures this-- this is beyond me that is not to say i would not be willing to help but there are many things to consider first perhaps you should speak with osysa osysa our patron of ioun she would have a better mind for this than me this is the same way you did last time follow me my apologies mertin he's over there he's currently putting the head into a small case and closing up and he goes aye not to worry i'll be more than happy to get this for you and he leaves for a second comes back goes through the contract reads a couple things pulls out a large chest and begins divvying up coin and throws a satchel to each of you that contains for both of you divided for this contract that would come to 2250 gold pieces of course that's what i'm here for regardless shall we very well and she begins walking further to the back of the guild hall where you come to the same doorway that you previously entered with her before the chains in the side that sets up a large slab that leads to a staircase that leads to the subterranean area right beneath the slayer's take you may have noticed it previously but there is a structure above where the subterranean area is behind the slayer's take and it's-- it looks like a very simple temple you haven't really gone into it but as you step down into this dark area underneath you can see the sconces lighting along with you as you step into this dark cavern as it opens up once again you can see the remnants of this hidden temple to ioun the goddess of knowledge and what's curious about this temple is ioun is a goddess of knowledge and openness one of her main astute pushes is the fact that knowledge is to be shared and spread so it's curious to see that something of hers is hidden there's probably a purpose to that pushing up the steps again vanessa puts her hand up and tells you all to stop and calls out again osysa i apologize to bother you but we have a predicament that i believe requires your attention as a moment passes where once again you hear the low rumbling growl in the shadows (growls) you hear slams of giant footfalls across stone as what little bit of light torches begin to spark to life around the top of this platform this stone platform and at the very top of this staircase that leads to the top of where this platform ends you can see standing above it a very large female sphinx with a lion body a female head adorned with golden jewels around the neck eyes that are light sky blue and white in color proud as these giant griffin-like wings stretch out and the entity comes to rest at the top paws folded over the edge yes i recall so what do you need of me the head sinks for a moment i have been watching by the heartstone naught but this past day i have been keeping tabs in hopes that such a cataclysm would not find its way to my mate it has not so being aware of this what do you ask she thinks for a second steps up and closes her eyes as her muscles tense her eyes open again that color flashing with this luminescent blue color and her voice falls even deeper into her register and almost has this monotone informative projection that says the vestiges of divergence relics wielded when the gods walked and fought alongside their creations the light fades from the eyes for a second she catches herself and steps back she shakes her head i am a channel for this knowledge but the best i can understand they are old relics of the war of the divergence leading into the penance the second spark these were armaments objects of great power that were used in these wars against the gods good and dark many have been buried entombed lost forgotten the few that are recovered are passed on through blood lines through symbols of power and of seats of great political importance but the actual information is lost to me she concentrates for a second not within my field of vision objects of this powerful enchantment are also prone to want to keep themselves hidden the danger that you run here is that vasselheim has stood the test of time and survived two possible ends of civilization as we know it but it has survived both of these events because those who guard it stayed to guard it you may be hard-pressed to convince others to step beyond the walls knowing that such a danger could use that to their advantage and destroy the greatest city that we know of you are welcome to ask but it will be a difficult journey what i can offer though my mate is a keeper of much hidden knowledge over on his side of tal'dorei i may be able to send you to him to seek this information i am one of the chosen of ioun he does not serve her directly her large paws cross once again and she looks at you with a stern expression there is great danger and darkness in this world and there are many fools who stand up in hopes that they can keep it at bay if we were to lend our power to you i would ask that you prove yourselves the ones that could carry this torch perhaps find these relics gather other allies prove to me that i would not be sending my people to their doom then return perhaps then when you think you are ready we could lend our guild to your service she closes her eyes and concentrates for a moment south of the frostweald the mountain range that guards it her eyes open again understand that it is our nature to present challenges part of his journey to seek him is to find him yourself that is the first step it is his name to give and she steps back and you see the crystal sphere the heartstone that she once helped you look through before to look back at the world glows beneath framing light under her form yes as you say that name she snarls (roars) it would do you right to not mention that name in this place yes i know of him if i did we would have done so long ago this creature is one of the few entities that shrouds my vision the limits of our sight of the things we seek to discover and unveil are constantly balked by the veil of darkness he throws over the world he may have been held at bay many thought destroyed hundreds of years ago but no he stays and he squeezes a stranglehold on everything we seek to accomplish what do you know whitestone she steps back for a second her eyes flare up with energy again you can see the heartstone embedded in the floor of the stone glow even brighter and brighter as she puts her paws in the side and peers into it she begins to mutter beneath her breath i can see the snowy north of tal'dorei the castle beneath one of our corrupted temples forgotten long ago the ziggurats were not of his construction but he took them her eyes wince for a moment her head turns for a minute her vision and face staring in the distance i look out to follow the anger the swath of death and hatred those who took emon they draw my gaze something is happening the path to westruun eastward parts smoldering and left behind the path continues over the lucidian ocean eastward beyond the shores of wildemount her head looks up still staring off into the distance into the drimaulth ravine i see the floating islands of draconia falling crumbling gone an army sundered people ruined the conclave sated returns towards your land once more you can see blood pouring out of one of her nostrils now the light dulls in her eyes and the heartstone fades for a moment she gathers herself i peered too far beyond the veil that contains me i'm sorry my (pained grunt)-- she plops down and is breathing a little heavy she takes a few steps down towards you brother kashaw it would be appreciated thank you she steps up and bows her head to you she steps to the top of the temple once again i've seen this darkness you speak of under whitestone and i shall speak out to our brethren of ioun in hopes of discovering the nature of this shadow i'm sorry i must rest return when you have proven yourself when you think this conclave could possibly be felled beneath your weapons and might and will she whips around the wings (whoosh) as the torches atop the temple flare out and you can see the edge of osysa's form as she dives into the shadow to the back of the temple you can hear the impact of giant footfalls against sand and then silence there's a very slow clap echoing into the cavern as vanessa goes-- (laughter) the frostweald is back in-- south of westruun that was where you got the heart of the nymph we have things we can provide as you are members mind you not extremely active members as of late but make a persuasion check no that's closer to disadvantage (laughter) yes i'll provide you with what we can come with me so you guys step up and you lead back to the slayer's take guildhall she snaps at mertin whispers something in his ear and he comes and offers a small chest to you guys that contains two potions of healing and one potion of greater healing go to the quadroads i'm afraid your symbols have been getting dusty zahra what can i do for you and there is a lot of great money that you've made that could pay for these things i've given you already more than i needed to you can afford it if you were broke and asking me maybe i'd be happy to ask but i just paid you quite a sum of money i feel like i'm being taken advantage of and none is taken however i would say there is business to be had deeper in the city you wish potions there are those that purchase them i've already given you what i have and what you've earned very well i look forward to you coming back and proving me wrong (deadpan) i've never heard this before (laughter) the gnome speaks because i do not have to but good luck and don't stray too far stay safe please i put a lot of faith in you as you say that you hear a voice in the back of the room go what is she you see aldor in the back table he's already up with his bag ready to run (laughter) he's the ambassador all right so you guys head out of the slayer's take guildhall into vasselheim which is now a little more bustling than it was when you arrived it's about midday the sun is still not visible there's enough cloud cover where you can see where it would be in the sky but it's still pretty grey no rain and there is still relatively recent snow that covers most of the city streets some of which has been pushed to the sides to make walkways easier it's been snowing here in the winter rather often as you two are both very aware you have multiple things you want the potion shop there's the platinum sanctuary i think last time you mentioned the trial forge what do you guys want to do all right so you make your way to the quadroads yeah coming back to the center of the quadroads you guys have been here before this is where the center of the city's trade happens imagine the central abdar's promenade of emon as it once was but condensed and it is just hovels and tents and all these open shops that are crammed in this heavy space it looks like the-- what's it from hellboy ii-- wall to wall buildings but people not weird creatures people shouting people are-- get some proper audio for this one second exactly so as you guys are walking around you eventually find your way up to the same area where you found the potions from before you can see him there he's wearing an open red vest that falls to the ground behind him arms are revealed he has these thick bracers on that are really finely scrolled with brass he's got a fine van dyke beard going on now he's currently speaking with someone off to the side yes of course i'm more than happy to yes you i remember you oh it's been quite some time-- step on over here sir i would love having more-- yes can i help you he got a fantastic deal the last time he's a grade a customer i'm sorry is there a problem hoo hoo hoo do i do not worry sir hold on just a moment he disappears into the small tent opening behind him music to my ears you hear from inside the tent as he comes out with this long very well-carved wooden-- looks like a test tube set almost there are all various potions of different sizes and colors he sets it down so potions of healing you say he pulls out a few of them this here i have two superior healing potions three greater healing potions and ten regular potions of healing at your disposal should you require them mm yes and by far a handsome and intelligent salesman and yet she was so abrasive when she arrived fine hmph trinket stumbles inside this one really how many would you like what do you want all of them (chuckles) well then let me do my math here he looks through it all right um the take are you with the take yes there is indeed a discount with the take (nervous laugh) they've been great representatives in the past yes with friendship discount let me total this up a bit here that will be 6500 gold pieces for the lot 6500 gold pieces for the lot with the discount make a deception check make a deception check i would say you know if you wanted to-- you can assist on this yeah that gives you advantage on the roll huh no it just gives her advantage he goes no no no no put them on the table please i would like to have a look just in casies sure make a sleight of hand check 18 okay as you sit down (poof) this little like-- all the dust on the front a little of the dampness is (poof) hmm he pulls out a little glass eyepiece inspects the craftsmanship is decent what are the components on that on the spell what does it say under components visual yeah you don't have to actually do anything to it it just happens you need to make a sleight of hand check okay so you set down which one of the knickknacks now which one these things that you pulled out of the-- there you go oh from that i'm sorry (laughter) got you i'm sorry i misunderstood so what this is it's like a really really intricate inkwell that has been made out of gold and bronze it's stuff you find in a skymall essentially all right so as the gust of wind fades the table begins to shake and he glances in across the outside of this inkwell amongst a bunch of other random knickknacks scattered around it he looks at it for a second this flash in his eyes he goes hmm they seem fair enough i would say include these in the transaction i would be willing to drop the cost by about 500 gold pieces an even 6000 i do actually i'm quite the appraiser it's part of my business well then step away you don't need my business obviously is this how your 'shiny manager' deals with your shinies or would you wish to deal with this face to face that is ridiculous no what does that mean make an intimidation check (laughing) with advantage because she's helping (laughter) roll a d20 twice and take the higher of the two add your intimidation um they're fine uh quite fine yes a thousand gold off the asking price that-- that's ridiculous it's not even-- what are you-- i-- 1300 off the asking price nothing more he's looking like over you guys now towards the thoroughfare ah um perhaps uh-- i would need um five thousand gold knickknacks and ah we're all good yes all right here you are please now it would be wondrous after we complete this transaction that we never meet again i don't even know what that means (laughter) thank you good day good day to him he takes it confused and goes-- you grab the potions that are on the table that he pushed towards you there is one superior healing-- yes one superior two greater ten regular it would only have been like two points of damage to you so that would have healed up fine so you come into the tent after him he turns around the superior potions are five thousand gold apiece baseline i said all the ones i placed on the table before you you've made a grand deal with what we said if you continue to push this i'm afraid i'm going to have to get the guards you can go back and take a moment and sniff yeah go ahead and make a perception check make a perception check you take it and uncork and sniff yeah it's a very familiar pungent herbal smell of-- yeah (laughter) you have a fair map of tal'dorei and you have what is a basic layout of the continents you met tyriok here though you haven't seen him he mentioned to you previously he's currently traveling to finish his-- yes othanzia is the larger country set around the continent is issylra issylra is a very large continent it's almost the equivalent of asia and russia like that whole-- it's very wide and a lot of it is wild and untamed land and wilderness hmm a superior heals 8d4 plus eight oh my god i just buy healing to save my life such a waste (laughter) yep correct yes the two taverns you've been to is that of the bellows' respite inn which is in the braving grounds so yeah you can go to either one of those up to you closer would be the bellows' respite that's also where the crucible was the one that was on the outside of it so you guys go get drinks who's going-- you can go back and ask the slayer's take they have basic maps of the nearby countryside a lot of the contracts require you to travel across this side of othanzia you go back and you talk to vanessa and you procure one of the maps there that are usually supplied for one of your missions all right so most of them are drinking vex and percival head-- you guys are all heading actually in the same area to the braving grounds outside the trial forge since that's where the bar is and that's also where victor's little powder-covered hovel is so (laughs) as you approach the same area you can see that the building is the same as it was before other than it's missing half a roof it appears to be haphazardly covered with a series of boards that were nailed to keep things closed but there is definitely with the snow and the rain it's probably not the best place to be staying or living trinket's trying to get the coat off some movement and you hear the shattering of glass and you hear a (frustrated noise) just a moment suddenly the door whoosh slams open and before you you see victor half covered in soot has a big old thick pair of glasses on his face one of which is cracked you can see his chin now has this puffed out partially burnt and curled bit of a goatee at the very tip of his chin he looks up at you with these giant eyes that are projected and magnified by his eyewear can i help you (laughter) no (laughter) is that all yes yes come in please come in he turns around and heads back inside as you enter indeed a good half of the roof is missing and you see now a lot of things have been moved away because currently there is a pile of burnt and destroyed wood splinters that are also soaked through and there's a little bit of mold and rotten mildew that has gathered in that far corner as well from the weather heh heh mostly he turns around and you can see now what you failed to notice when you first started this is where once there was five there is now three fingers learn from my mistakes (laughter) i can three four-- yes he runs off and starts rummaging through a bunch of stuff i'm on it i'm on it hold on he whips around with this metallic cylinder that is very well sealed see i learn from my mistakes he walks very carefully very gingerly placing it on the table okay carefully he pulls out (fwoosh) a small torch i have to unseal the metal okay you smack it out of his hand heh heh heh heh it's coffee (laughter) yeah sorry trying to host it's been a while since i've had a guest would you like some he goes over to a small kettle and begins straining it through he's got this little coffee brew on the side so real black powder wait i do know you you've purchased before return customer not many of those he pours a couple of cups for you pulls it over to you oh one months ago nice woman young good outfit well dressed heh no no weeks not months time-- strange no she paid well kept her distance three yes oh i have to fix that explains the cold he smears black right across the front of his face it's like gelled in with whatever mucus had been captured in there as well streaked across he comes back and he's now keeping previously it was out in the open he's learned his lesson he has these glass vials similar to what they put potions in but now he's filling them with powder and he brings out about four of them this is as much as i will spare i already sold a lot recently to the lady i have my own tinkering to do but if you wish to buy these i would be happy to sell okay process of distilling drying preparing 250 gold wondrous deal deal hiiii would you like some coffee 50 gold make a persuasion roll (laughs) given the circumstance he has a really low dc on this so i'm glad this is the one you rolled a 12 on he goes for you i saw nothing (laughter) he catches it and he grabs a glass vial and puts it in and caps it up yes will do bye he waves with his three fingers close the door when you're done the rest of you find your way back at the bellows' respite inn where the rest of the party has been drinking (cheering) wow you've been drinking a barkeep comes by a human gentleman you recognize from before as once-lucky ned who had originally given you some information comes by puts the drinks down i thought it was you heh heh phillip phillip it's good to see you oh he beat the name out of you that's harsh right right you want to be known as i see (clicks tongue) i got you grog the phillip is in town should anyone wish to take the title of the crucible this would be the one to talk to heh-heh faces turn then go back to business yeah once-lucky ned is there oh i apologize i know of him he doesn't come in and drink no he spends most of his days over there in that big trial forge temple of kord he'll go into the city on occasion but he's one of them how do i put it 'medititive' types yes spends a lot of time thinking sleeping while standing up it's weird you'll have to ask him yes no worries i mean if i recall he actually came and saw your last bout go over there to the trial forge he's seen you once maybe he'll say hello again i don't know i don't ever talk to him no clue well no it's probably about 130 2 o'clock in the afternoon while this is happening vex you glance over her shoulder to the entryway to this bar and you see stepping in a familiar burly looking half-orc gentleman he walks in wiping his hands from dirt in the mines stops looks over at your table slowly backs out of the tavern and steps back out into the thoroughfare yeah make a perception check 18 you step out in the front of the tavern and immediately to the left you see him ducking into the alleyway okay you turn around the corner and you see his back is against the wall and he has sweat dripping down his brow hi at this point-- he looks down still a little sore how about you yeah yeah yeah the earthbreaker i've seen him around haven't really i talked to him once i'll level with you went to him for a little training after our first fight um says i'm a little too angry to pursue his path i got a lot of pent-up rage the way i was raised (laughter) tell me about it (chuckles) well half my folks are bloodthirsty wandering barbarians in the northern wastes yeah what you think being a half-orc's great no it's bullshit at least you're made for this weather it's cold out here yeah it is sorry i took yours off too yeah well obviously not really he didn't ask for any pay he-- he told me i had-- --to help someone (laughter) he still hasn't given me the proper details yet and he hasn't called in the debt but he told me one day i was to help him test someone and he'd train me not as big as him no but there's plenty of others that train under him all sorts of warriors weapons of all kinds it's kord he looks over and you see in the distance the giant statue of kord that sits atop the trial forge he looks over and with a look of reverence gives a nod and you can see that this man a glimmer of faith in his eyes he himself probably a follower of kord as well he's a great man i'm not the right temperament it seems but that's fine he's getting along okay probably the platinum sanctuary between them and the trial forge that's most of the actual army most of it's trial forge it's part of what the braving grounds are about they train the armies here it's where they breed warriors most of the bastions that look over the city are trained here so it's-- those are my best bets at least not much of a political man you too um the medal was a joke i was in a sore place literally a very very sore place i wanted to apologize for that i should go he starts walking past you out into the main street he doesn't even look back to you uh you too and keeps walking (laughter) okay of course coming your way all right after a brief time of coffee and a bit of sobering you find yourselves of sound enough mind a few hours two hours let's say it's four five o'clock in the afternoon as you sobering up the coffee's helped you find yourself clear of mind to continue onto your intended events for the day with that we're going to go ahead and take a break we'll be back here-- (cheering) all right guys we'll see you here in a few minutes thank you (laughter) welcome back everyone so before we get back into this a couple quick announcements one if we get to 15000 subscribers tonight tomorrow's crew will be celebrating 15k and a cosplay day all of our crew will be dressing up as their favorite characters all night so you guys should go ahead and see if we can hit that number because that would be

it more awesome so there's that liam will join us when he can but we're going to jump in for the time being so as you guys exit the tavern you look out into the braving fields there is that yeah so you're in the center of the braving grounds-- we traded liam for travis exactly to your left around the heaven's stair the giant mountain that bisects the northern portion of vasselheim around that way a little bit of travel but that heads towards the bahamut section of the city where the platinum sanctuary is to your vision immediately outside the tavern you can see the giant statue of kord where the trial forge is and to the south of you is where the quadroads are in the southern regions what do you guys want to do it's been a few hours and you guys have had some coffee so you're still a little tipsy but you're not useless (laughter) all right you guys make your way south southwest around the curvature of the base of the heaven's stair you can see up along the mountain itself large ominous this monolith of earth that looks over the entirety of vasselheim you can see embedded in the rock itself there are various homesteads toward the base as you look up you can see there's a number of stairways that just spiral around in different directions you can see small cliffs and precipices that are built on the outside and look to be either various places of individual worship where statues are just barely visible cresting on the edge there's a number of constructs just built into this mountain that are probably as old as the city itself you make your way around the south portion of it back into the actual area of vasselheim the silver talon's reach which is where largely bahamut's worship occurs you make your way past the scattered temples all the different huts and hovels that build the central residential real estate to this territory there are a few homes here that look a little bit like-- this town is built on existing in hardship and difficulty so a lot of people here are just stern folk that live amongst terrible weather and money and wealth isn't really presented or flaunted in this city it's considered in very poor taste as everyone here is in some way shape or form to some level is pious to some degree to one of the deities that are worshipped here you find your way to the base of the stair that you recall following when you first arrived here in vasselheim that leads up to the platinum sanctuary where you were delivering the horn of orcus originally you follow it up the side and it is an extended staircase that curves up to these three silver spires that are pushing out from the side of the mountain quite a ways up after about almost 20 minutes of stair climbing your legs start to cramp a bit but you manage to make your way towards the top the outside of the large stone doors there you can see there are two scalebearers of vord in their silver armor blue cloaks at their back weapons at the ready just looking out and as soon as you guys approach the top of the stairway they change their stance to be a little more prepared your business is with whom turns nods to the other guy they both grab these small handles and give a tug and the door opens slightly and one of the guys disappears between the two doors about 30 seconds pass to a minute before he steps back out your presence has been accepted by the highbearer vord the silvertouched he will greet you in the central chamber please highbearer would suffice please enter he doesn't answer the doors open even wider so as you guys enter the chamber once more this is close to where you flew in in bird form and almost got arrested by the highbearers so as you enter the chamber you see a number of the guards have already assembled and they're giving you a walkway path both as a presentory arrival vigil but also making sure that you don't wander off the predestined path to the main central meeting chamber no just-- they're protecting their temple you guys continue inward towards the central chamber the high stone ceiling before you you can see there are holes carved throughout the ceiling and the stonework that cause beams of light to come shooting through from the sky what catches your interest in here is that the sky is cloudy there is no specific source of direct sunlight yet there are beams of light within the temple itself that form a pattern across the stone marble floor of the central chamber certainly the pattern resembles a large shield when you look at it it's pointed toward the base of where you guys are walking in and fills most of the chamber in an oval fashion before coming together in a line towards the back 17 okay this definitely isn't a natural occurrence the sunlight should not be projecting this way which leads you to believe that there's something about the temple's enchantment or its construction that can either dissipate the veil of clouds to the sunlight or produce their own light to mimic it during all hours you've seen-- the shield itself is akin to the symbol of bahamut which is a shield with a silver dragon head on it you've seen kima use it previously when you guys were looking after her in the underdark as you guys push to the central chamber you can see there's a line of three heavily armored knights of bahamut that are all there standing shields at the ready big tower shields that almost touch the ground two of them separate to one side and one separates to the other and in the center arriving before you is highbearer vord the silvertouched who some of you are seeing for the first time long light brown hair that crests down past his shoulders his features are very elven very soft and ageless but there is a very faint bluish hue to his skin his eyes have no irises no pupils steps forward and extends his hands it is good to see such friends so i ask you once again to join me in this chamber can i help you he looks about the rest of you with a discerning glance just spending a beat on each of you almost like you're being judged and read in that instant you feel as if someone is prying into your personality with but a glance and it's unsettling at first but nothing too invasive just enough to catch you off guard as he finishes the sweep of the party at hand i was given a vision in the night of a far city of man swathed in ice and flame of colors bonded and unleashed and i feared it was the work of our lord's nemesis he puts his hand up however with much prayer of mine and my acolytes we find no tremor of the dragon queen nor the stench of baator on this business baator b-a-a-t-o-r make a religion check all of you sure make a religion check okay none of these ring a bell except for you kashaw the dragon queen is indeed the nemesis of the platinum dragon bahamut it is an entity known as tiamat and is essentially the patron of most chromatic dragons she resides in baator which is one of the nine hells however it seems that vord is speaking in a way that through much disturbed interest and prayer into this matter there doesn't seem to be the scent of tiamat's doing in this matter and strangely you see a bit of the tension in his face relax as he tells you this while these entities do concern us there is the alternate vow that we've spoken and that is to protect vasselheim the city has stood as long as it has because we have not left our post and the moment that we were to attempt to move even a minority of our people in the city to be of aid to you in this endeavor this would be the moment that the dragon queen will be waiting for to attack our citadel there are many more forces beyond these dragons that you speak of in this world bent against the destruction of this city and we stand because we hold vigil here and yet it avoided our city do you know why because even such creatures know better than to lend their talons against us do you think this will be the first time that ancient dragons have attempted to attack our fair city i can guarantee you should they mount an attack on us four or not they will fall well we had the aid of bahamut with us at that time and he glances up and you look up and you can see the rays of sun that have come through here from your current position you can see actually form a matching symbol not of a shield but of a giant winged dragon outstretched across the curved roof of this temple drinking well understand i hear your plight and i understand that we must aid you in this endeavor best that we can but we cannot swear to you our army well now while you seek out whatever your plot is to tear these creatures from their summit we will grant to you from our place in the dawn city our finest champion while i have no resources to offer at this time this champion shall come to your aid to help in any way that they can and once they can report their certainty that victory can be had perhaps we may be able to send a little more of our power your way the champion is here and he steps aside and puts his hand out and one of the armored knights steps forward full armor this tall wide-chested masculine form you can't see the face the helmet protects it but the shield comes out and slams the ground and goes to kneel on one knee your charge platinum knight udire one of our finest warriors whom has had time and time again-- at which point you hear a loud (clang) sound as all of a sudden udire's thrown off of his feet his shield bent in and skidding across the ground you see stepping up behind a female halfling scar across the face-- -- gold-trimmed armor blue cloak behind her shouting out oh no you don't this is my home turf i'm going highbearer vord rolls his eyes and sighs loudly (growls) kima you are in need of discipline and guidance more than most who walk the warrior's path your foolish impulses will get you killed she grins as she swings her maul slams it onto the stone ground a little bit of a rumble as you see a flash of divine energy from that and a beam from the sky comes down and frames her form as she stands there clutching the top of it better to die a fool for something than live in regret for doing nothing an awkward pause as udire gets back up on his feet and pulls up the front of his helmet you can see there's a very thin pencil 'stache underneath a chiseled jaw and a man who looks like probably an intense chivalrous-type knight gentleman except there's a look of complete disdain and frustration he gets up and goes really her vord raises his hand and grumbles very well your new charge is lady kima whom you are already affiliated please keep her from doing anything stupid his eyes squint for a moment as he puts his hands in front of his face hmm to step against such powerful dragons is indeed a death sentence it's true that you need to prepare arm yourselves against this doom while we are meant to stay here in the most holiest of places these relics you speak of from before the second spark still lie forgotten hmph these elements even balked the primordials of old blades that slew the children of the dark where these relics lie only story and tome can tell unfortunately know that at any given time you are not the only ones seeking this power consider things of such great strength are perpetually in the minds of those who would make their riches off of them or intend to take their own townships and peasantry under their own boot and gauntlet well i don't believe any of that such capability but i also am not a scholar of ancient magics and artifacts i have merely come across their whispers in books and various classes i took as a child there are tomes scattered throughout the city and there is the cobalt reserve that is unfortunate perhaps i wish i could tell you we had one such entrusted to us long ago but that was destroyed as part of the last assault on vasselheim that we withstood the stories say of at least a dozen i can't be certain i wish i could be of more aid in this but this is not a path that i chose to learn much on i have no idea though the warriors that once wielded these in the battles of old only seemed to have carried one or two each that was before my time my dear depends the second spark hmm he takes a moment to gather his thoughts as i take a moment to gather my notes (laughter) he's not happy at all about that hold on got it it's a long tale and i recommend you research the history yourself but during the times of creation when the gods first came upon this world it was a place of chaotic energies elements clashing the very landscape itself was in eternal turmoil wrestling for no purpose other than the destruction of the others there were no boundaries yet the gods still came and they created us the various beings and entities as they came to understand what their purpose was as they themselves were still uncertain as to why they came to be they hoped that through their creations they could learn more about themselves they began to watch the first burgeoning elves dwarves people within a short time a very short time the very chaotic nature of this landscape consumed and destroyed most of what remained the only city that stood the first city vasselheim the titans that walked across these lands great primordial elemental kings beings of no noble mind sought to destroy any light or beauty thus the first war began the peoples rose up the gods' feet touched the ground and alongside their creations they slew the titans with the first of these vestiges laying them to rest within the dirt within the sky casting the elements away from this plane and separate to their own where now they remain amidst fire earth air water and their muddy boundaries between thus came a time of great privilege and prosperity and it also came to be discovered that some of the gods as part of creation during this bout with the titans began to question the purpose of creation to embrace the chaos that they fought in this battle and they distanced themselves from the ones that guide us to this day they began to take the children of the gods to corrupt them teach them the wonders of arcana magics beyond the divine the gifts of the gods and for the first time the creations began to find power separate from the creators the arrogance to think that perhaps now they were gods themselves now they were the gods' creations and they loved them very much so they did not see this as a threat but as the second expansion of civilization spread across the world we saw rise great new towns and cities and civilizations and cultures as well as a new wave of insolence and selfishness and these new dark gods began to prey upon this and build a force to take those who still stay true to the first this terrible war this is what we knew as the divergence this is when the people were split in two the gods were divided as well bloody battles ensued and it looked as though while all other cities fell into ruin even vasselheim would fall but in this time these vestiges were expanded upon those first few weapons many more were created and the champions fought alongside the gods once more and victory was had the dark gods banished to various planes far from this plane but it was then the gods also decided that perhaps their delving had caused this and they receded leaving the mortals to find their own way to rebuild a second time with the warning of the dangers of arcane which vasselheim still to this day holds in its prime oaths many of these vestiges that you seek were destroyed but some were kept some were lost some were entombed some were re-found and rediscovered and used as symbols of power but since this second spark of civilization the gods felt that the true penance was the destruction of all their people had built and the gods leaving us to our own thus started the penance where to this day we still make up for the infractions and sins of our arrogant brothers and sisters of that day so since then we've had other new civilizations spring up wildemount tal'dorei syngorn marquet these are the newer cities of the third age we know of them understand artifacts and relics of this power are very dangerous and what better way to hide things of such power than to destroy the knowledge of where they may be or even if they exist yes it is possible i am not a practitioner of the history of the ashari people cobalt reserve there the monks keep some of the most ancient of texts we here at vasselheim keep a watchful eye on things that relate to the wars of old the history of our deities of our temples to not repeat the mistakes we have the monks are more eclectic in their collections perhaps they can be of more aid if they have it's a very-- no they would not be able to shroud the sight of the platinum dragon himself for chromatics it is the red one chromatic dragons respond to a few things gold dominance and strength if this red dragon is as ancient and as powerful as you say perhaps he even he could bully lesser dragons there are many possibilities you would have to ask one of them yourself i hope not but if it does we will do everything we can to see that this city stands it is the only link we have to the past should vasselheim fall i dare say all is lost that is your question from here civilization could spring anew people could defend themselves and thrive thereafter the rest of the world is scattered petty squabbles selfish personal endeavors that lead to foolishness and treachery should this city fall and one of those remain that is a breeding ground for the dark powers that lie beyond the veil it is only here that those who are the most devout could truly have the hearts and minds to guide us bahamut forbid into a fourth age which you see kima slams her hammer on the ground oh my god can we just go i'm sick of hearing him rattle on vord puts his hand out kima we do not deal in such teleportation magics beyond the divine-provided ones and those i assume are beyond most of you however there is still the skyport which i believe you arrived in when you first came to us other than that if none among you are able to achieve any sort of distance translocation then i highly doubt you have the ability to stand up against these dragons you seek to destroy shh and with that-- i have business for the day show our guests out please with pleasure slings her maul up on her shoulder let's step outside first and she leads you all outside the temple doors close as soon as the doors close she tells the two guards shove off please we have to have a conversation the guards kind of frustratedly turn around and go back and close the door as soon as the doors close behind them she goes oh my god guys (cheering) zahra nice to meet you kima lady kima hmph you're brooding all right so i caught some of that discussion dragons what are we after here i tend to glaze over when he's talking is she all right is allie all right my home temple's in westruun all right well i'm with you wherever you need me a few of you started early i'm jealous i can see it on your faces you all look a bit harrowed you surprise me day after day grog all right where are we off to it's roughly three days' travel southwest of vasselheim earthbreaker as in dawn marshal the great dawn marshal of-- (chuckles) i've only seen him from a distance he's a rough-looking fella i'm excited to see this puts it over her shoulder and she's walking down her little legs (clanging) with her armor down the stairs i've seen him punch someone's head clear off (laughs) you're not the only one and she continues rushing ahead you get the feeling that kima's been locked up and been doing temple stuff for quite some time and is very happy to get out of her general duties you guys head back down the outside of the heaven's stair making your way back to the outside of the trial forge you can still see now it's middle of the afternoon all the forges throughout the town are in full steam you see big plumes of black smoke pouring out of the various steelworks so as you guys approach the outside steps leading up to the doors of the trial forge you can see the large rust red-colored monument temple to kord very rigid and very much a temple built to withstand it's a fortress more than a temple and you see above it still across the lip at the very top at the front walkway a little bit of the kord statue looking over the entirety of this section of vasselheim the doors are actually ajar they're open there are two dawn marshals there in their armor with the colors of kord as you approach they step out of the way as you walk in the two dawn marshals that are out there put their arms together and they lower their head and bow and as you enter they close the doors behind you guys the doors slam behind you and you feel the stone shift from the impact of the thud 25- 30-foot-tall doors that mark the front of this the echo of the stone slam down the long hall you can see there are large pillars that mark the run to the central chamber you've been here before and as you walk across the smooth very very simple stonework ahead you can see there is the central portion it's almost like a giant cross like both sides of the temple meet in the center and there is a circular dip in the ground not really a pit it's only about four feet down but it's filled with a coarse sand and as you guys walk up to that edge each monk acknowledging you as you pass quietly you can hear the gentle chanting in the distance of low rumbling gregorian voices (chanting) and there sitting in the center of this open circular sand patch is the earthbreaker himself he is sitting there legs crossed arms resting at the edge of his knees eyes closed you can see even from here for those who haven't seen him before he wears simple free-flowing pants of a dark reddish color with a gold trim on the sides but they're tattered towards the bottom he has a one-shoulder wrap across the front there and these large prayer beads that hang around his neck his skin is very dark and weathered by sun and training and he is probably the most muscular human being you have seen for his proportional form he is a human being built for discipline and physical martial training and battle older though still you can see his long grey beard that rests about middle to his chest the balding on the front a little bit the rest of his grey hair rests to his mid-back and he just sits there quietly in the center the rest of the monks have gathered up and begun to form around the circle right now about 15 yeah super-quiet okay so you leap down into the sandpit okay so you guys on the side grog you leap off you don't know how deep it is but it's it's not it's hard sand it's packed so you just kind of-- right the depression's like an inch oh you mean the depression into the actual ground about four feet so you vault into it in a bound no he's still facing a little bit away from you in the far corner the silence is broken immediately by a low rumbling voice that seems to have no particular source in the vicinity where you stand it says you come because your lands now harbor a terrible conflagration how do you think groon can assist still facing away from you as most of you noticed this time his name is groon (laughter) yeah turns around towards you and says you stray from the darkness that i warned you but this current distraction is too great even your blood is drawn to the flames of promise and power this shall be a test to see if you will break against the shadow i know many things grog strongjaw but such knowledge is earned not given where do you find your strength as you're thinking in a blinding instant you see a flash of movement and like a dagger in your stomach his elbow is (impact sound) (groaning) puts his arm down strongjaw where do you find your strength you walk between worlds weakness in mind or weakness in conviction what do you stand for where do you find your strength at which point as you're getting up there's another blinding flash for a second and your feet are left out from under you go ahead and make an athletics check because you're now prepared for this one your feet go out from under you as you slam onto your back you just barely caught your breath before it's almost knocked out again he's looking down at you this time once again his eyes just white choose choose the two here who would save you who would push you to your potential choose your bloody muses he looks over to the rest of you on the side of the pit choose as you finish that sentence two monks that you failed to notice were behind you shove both of you into the pit make acrobatics checks both of you guys okay (laughter) groon takes two steps back and just closes his eyes and puts his arms at his sides now show me your conviction i need you three to roll initiative the statues that're set at the edge of this we're gonna put you grog there-- and boom i'll just move it this way a little bit just so you guys can see there we go all right so let me get groon's sheet out here okay so 25 to 20 all right 20 to 15 16 scanlan all right perfect first up's first you vax just standing with his arm up until what what's your trigger okay well your movement is in your turn it's your action you have to hold so are you gonna wait behind him can't you've got-- dude yes you do okay he has no idea where you are go for it 24 hits yeah both hit what's the range increment on this right but what's the max range yeah you're fine you're the first to go it is a crit it is not a sneak attack where could you possibly be vax where could you have possibly hidden from his sight in the middle of this giant open sandy arena it's okay but it is double damage well no it's surprise not the first to attack he is not surprised no it's not first it's just surprised you hit him twice roll damage the first one he deflects with his hand and it cuts the arm and you can see the little slash of damage it dealt the second one he's gonna use his reaction to do deflect missiles (laughs) yeah he reduces the damage entirely spends one of his ki points he catches the dagger and throws it right back at you not back at you though because you're currently behind grog that's 18 to hit okay so you take 12 points of piercing damage as he chucks vax's dagger back at you it sinks into your shoulder suddenly before it vanishes and returns to your belt all right now it is groon's turn groon is going to rush up to the front of grog-- actually no to the side here so you're both in combat technically and is going to make a flurry of blows attack using another one of his ki points so that's gonna be four attacks all against you grog so that's a 27 hits i'm pretty sure cocked 26 16 and 28 okay you take-- 31 points of bludgeoning damage and his kick just-- whack-- right across the jaw you haven't even raged yet and the pain is intense your vision goes white for a second and go ahead and make a dex saving throw as his fourth action sweeps your feet out from under you and you are knocked prone on the ground that's his turn grog you're up now no no no you just use half your movement for that go for it 25 hits misses 21 points of damage all righty yeah he makes it (laughs) sorry all right so you can move yeah right there you mean vax is there then that would be your flanking potential there okay cool that ends your turn scanlan you're up all righty and that is eyebite all right so it's a-- you said wisdom save all right what's the dc no he fails it so what are you doing (laughs) okay okay okay what happens is as soon as you move around grog and you sing at him he glances over at you for a second and his eyes roll back and he (impact sound) and just falls back in the sand unconscious at which point all the monks currently are gasping in immediate reaction (laughter) actually you know what no go ahead i forgot to read something go ahead my own fault take your d10 that ends scanlan's turn vax you're up all right go for it as you go and attempt to strike him-- you had advantage on the attacks by the way because he's on the ground okay good that hits first two hit right which is doubled because he's unconscious melee attack within five feet 59 hoo ten so as you-- whack-- hit him in the head he immediately comes back to consciousness okay as you move aside even on the ground prone he swings his leg out to try and catch you as you're running past he has disadvantage on this anyway that is still a 24 to hit well he woke up after you slammed him second attack hits and in reaction as he sees you rush off he kicks his leg up and manages to catch you it doesn't manage to trip you but it does deal-- so you deal half the damage on that all right so you take-- what would be 12 points of damage you take six points of bludgeoning damage it was quite uncanny all right that ends your turn all right it's now his turn all right so so yeah until the spell ends you can use your action every turn to try and give him another effect if you wanted to scanlan so he still has eyebite but he's conscious you can if you want to when it comes to your next turn but it has to be on your turn to use your action to do it he gets up using half his movement which is fine he's going to as he looks over and you can see him glance to the side of grog and see where you are as the giant crack in the side of his head and the blood that's trickling down the side of his face he just rushes around still in melee with you so he doesn't get an attack of opportunity and he's gonna go unarmed attacks on you for three natural 20 that's a 17 with your haste yeah you get a bonus so that's a miss and that is a 25 all right so the crit 28 points of bludgeoning damage and the last one is gonna be 14 points of bludgeoning damage and he's going to use three ki points as he comes around elbows you to the side of the face you just weren't expecting it and it cracks you and you feel like a tooth crack and the pain sears through your jaw and you're like ugh and then he brings his lower hand and (impact) hits you right in the center of the abdomen and it hits you and it hurts but it's not as impactful as you thought it would be for the force but you feel like this strange like quivering vibration in your midsection like almost like the muscles are spasming uncontrollably and you don't quite understand why that is going to end his turn grog you're up okay go for it 28 hits 23 hits misses nice third missed all right succeeds on the first save with an 18-- and a 19 yeah saves both hits from craven edge as you slam the blade into him twice he's trying to parry them and he's catching the blade off to the side but the strength is too strong and you end up jamming it into his forearm as you pull away the blood streaks out each hit he's still focused on you and he's not showing any pain he's not grimacing you're just seeing the wounds being had and he's just still intent on moving and his expression focused on you yeah and at that moment he looks at you and says you carry such a dark weapon with you that's all he says is that the end of your turn all right scanlan correct yes actually let's see he has to save at the end of his turn which he rolled a one so no all righty yeah as you keep focusing you can see his form shifts a little bit and you swear you hear the cramping of someone's abdominals in the distance like an unhappy digestive tract take your d10 inspiration all right that brings us to the top is that the end of your turn are you gonna move or anything else-- all right you're up correct like that yeah you double the sneak-attack damage it's a critical hit all the dice you roll for a critical hit you double and then you add the ability modifier at the end so yes rogues baby not quadrupled doubled it's doubled not quadrupled it's not a surprise attack no which is meaning you get sneak attack so you're doing sneak-attack damage on him you critically hit so you just double your sneak attack damage yeah you said quadruple it's not quadruple it's just times two oh total of 68 gotcha he is going to use a ki point to deflect missiles okay all right it's not an attack roll on this yet just so you're aware this is him just reducing the damage he takes from it so that is a total of he reduces the damage by 13 he still takes the impact but he manages to slow the blade with his hands before it finds itself in his chest and he rips it out you can see the spray of blood that hits in the sand across the front before the dagger disappears from his grip all right nope this one-- for nothing wait so you did a total of 60-something damage on him from the one attack yeah got you yes the second one does-- yeah so the second one attack hits go ahead and roll for it or roll for damage nine okay cool cool that's good well as it comes back to groon's turn groon you can see the blood is just pouring out of the wound that you left he takes one hand and just (impact sound) slams it really hard and it just kind of the impact sears the wound cauterizing it still looking at you he puts his hand out and does this and that quivering in your stomach you felt earlier begins to shake and the vibrations begin to spread through your entire body i need you to make a constitution saving throw yeah yeah 23 that is a success you manage to just stave it off as you can feel it about to tear your insides apart and you just tense real fast and the vibrations slowly fade no effect would've been 10d10 necrotic damage it's called quivering palm it's a monk ability he's going to use another ki point a bonus action as he goes into a defensive stance a familiar one that you've seen before yeah but into this fully defensive looking about and keeping his eyes aware of the entirety of his surroundings and is going to stay right there that brings us to grog yeah are you doing reckless attacks or not okay his patient defense gives you disadvantage on all attacks-- he just nullifies it so you just have one roll per attack misses just knocks the blade out with his own hand you hear it (impact) off to the side this time he actually catches with the two sides of his hand and throws it back towards you 27 he goes to try and catch it but you change the direction of the blade at the last minute and find the side of his flesh go ahead and roll damage he does make his save on that 29 damage he's got a decent constitution all right so the third blade finally sinks in about two inches into his clavicle area and probably would snap the clavicle bone if he hadn't put his hands up and caught as much of the impact as he could and then throws it back again and just kicks you away to get a little bit of distance it's just like a foot just away from being clenched up right there yeah you can do that go for it all right that ends your turn scanlan you're up well let me see actually if he resists the-- nope actually actually no remembering this because i kept forgetting to do it before but that's fine he's gonna use his legendary resistance to automatically succeed so he no longer has eyebite so sickness fades he spent last round not doing any actual physical attacks for that reason there you go not between them no but you can put it like next to him or behind him make a melee spell attack got it melee spell attack you add your spell attack modifier which should be on your spell page 27 that's a hit as the hand appears to his right he's still focusing on grog and glances over for a second and tries to do a deflection technically he's still in his defense stance though so roll twice because he does have disadvantage for attacks on him yeah yep 4d8 force damage 17 damage yep so as bigby's hand pulls back with a giant fist the fingers cracking in an arcane echo whack slams into his side he holds himself strong and actually slides about seven inches in the sand from the impact and you can see him shake off his arm from the hit yeah that hurt all right take your d10 (laughter) go for it 23 you're rolling disadvantage on all these right for all these attacks because he's still in his patient defense stance so what was this roll you just got-- yeah first one missed the second one was a 23 and what did you roll roll again it's fine misses 21 misses (groaning) at the end of your turn before it's his turn he's gonna go ahead and use one action point to use like the wind where he moves his speed without taking attacks of opportunity he turns and rushes up to scanlan starting his turn now he's gonna come for you scanlan he's gonna go ahead and do a flurry of blows against you so scanlan first attack is 29 natural one fails on the second one okay well the third one is a 20 and the fourth one is a 31 so three hits whichever one you want so the first one hits cutting words to reduce the attack on the-- yeah so go ahead and roll your d10 six what's your ac yeah no so you manage to what do you shout at him as he's doing these punches against you he cocks his head like a confused puppy for a second and the fist just hits air above your head however you do take 14 points of bludgeoning damage from the first strike and another 14 points of bludgeoning damage so a total of 28 points of bludgeoning damage from two hits go ahead and make a dex saving throw if you could 20's what you need his last hit he's trying to kick you square in the chest and knock you off your feet and while it hits you it actually forces you back into vax and vax holds you up and you manage to keep on your feet or no it's grog's turn it's grog's turn because you just took yours yeah so you're gonna move up to him oh and as a note i need you to make a concentration check for both of those hits they were 14 damage each so and you have warcaster right so go ahead and make constitution checks constitution let me look at this okay yeah that's gonna end concentration bigby's hand off the table too much damage for you on that one so from the impact of the blows you just managed the spell fizzles from your mind and the hand dissipates into the distance all right now grog no 24 hits you've gotta say great weapon master before you roll by the way yeah because it can't be like oh that doesn't hit i'm not gonna do great weapon master yet you have to get the penalty before you roll you said it was a 24 for that one it would've been a twenty--- it hit regardless so yeah so the first one was just a regular hit 20 misses yeah so 23 just hits (cheering) 19 damage all right 27 got it both of the strikes makes his save makes his save it's a 12 dc it's not a very hard dc for-- he probably will eventually so anyway as you're striking the blades at him the pain he's just taking the pain to his back now because he's facing scanlan and both times hack into the back of his shoulderblades and the exposed muscle you can see as the blade draws back you can see the muscle and the blood arcing after each draw of the weapon however he glances over his shoulder at you as you finish your second blow and at the end of your turn he's gonna use two action points to use whirlwind of blows-- you already moved yeah i mean you can keep moving if you wanted to move away you can't move between but you can get there if you want okay so he's gonna get an attack on everyone within range of his punches which would be you and scanlan that is gonna be a 26 against you and a natural 20 against scanlan first to you grog that is 18 points of bludgeoning damage halved to nine and scanlan that is six no sorry-- 24 points of bludgeoning damage all right now it's scanlan's turn so last turn you missed all three on him remember yep you can yeah so as you're there in front you just reach back-- all right what's the dc i imagine this was out of your-- 19 with the hand cone so you were like hup yaaaa 19 he's going to use another of his legendary resistances to make the save and he has evasion which means dex save for half he gets no damage on his success so as you do lightning bolt he literally just goes into the splits as the bolt streaks over his head slams one of the nearby pillars and as you realize that you look down at him as he squeezes his legs back together and lands right back on his feet is that your turn okay go for it sure go for it all right that ends your turn vax you're up good to know going forward that's gonna be your action so you won't have any attacks this round in order to get the additional well actually no you would get one attack from the haste you would your offhand attack you don't get unless you're doing an attack action so you get one attack 19 misses yeah okay so move there at the end of your turn he's gonna use his last action point to do an unarmed attack against grog that's gonna be a 21 it hits okay you take ten points of bludgeoning damage half he's gonna use another ki point to i need you to make a constitution save 17 as he turns back and slams his fist right in the center of your clavicle you feel a crack in the sternum and your whole body all your muscles just seize up and you are currently stunned from a stunning strike until the end of his next turn however it's now his next turn but you're still stunned he is now going to since you don't have a threat to him he's going to swing around jump between the two of them and he's gonna do a flurry of blows two punches against each of you against scanlan that's a 17 that hits okay second one is a 17 again do you have any more uses of your bardic inspiration you have a limited number of bardic inspirations per short rest that you can use and you've used quite a few this battle yeah you use one of those dice to reduce the damage you've inspired at least-- grog twice now so this would be your last one all right go for it it doesn't matter what you roll you're still okay so one of the attacks as he's coming for you he hits you once and as he rears back for another kick to the side of your head you shout-- just enough pause for you to duck out of the way however he uses that inertia to spin back on vax for a 27 and a 21 okay so scanlan you take nine points of bludgeoning damage vex you take ah-- sorry vax every now and then 14 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to half and the other one is nine points yep so a total of 16 points of damage he's going to use a ki point again i need you to make a constitution saving throw 14 towards the end of his turn grog's stun shifts off of him you feel your muscles tense up and you almost fall to your knees as your whole body seizes the muscles just lock in place all righty grog it's your turn okay so you drop the weapon for free you pull out the fire hammer and it bursts into flame in your hands as you wield it as you drop craven edge you hear this voice scream in the back of your head you fool this fight is ours as the hammer lights up you just feel this cold dread run down your spine i need you to make a will saving throw a wisdom saving throw ten you can't possibly let that blade go away and you drop the hammer and pick up craven edge once more this is the true weapon of a warrior and you are not gonna relinquish it there is no way you could let go of this blade okay the process of picking it up we'll say would take away your bonus action so you get two attacks second one hits 19 all righty this time as the hammer falls to the ground the flames go out and craven edge streaks again no makes his saving throw as it hits him he stops for a second puts his hands together i need you to make another wisdom saving throw (dramatic music cue) your vision goes dark as all the sight around you goes to black and the entire vicinity of this fades except for the earthbreaker before you just staring at you in this darkness then he steps towards you one step second step and while his mouth doesn't move you can hear his voice piercing into your head that just says grog you are stronger than this thing that binds you where do you find your strength the darkness around you immediately shatters and you can see now your friends off to the side keeping their weapons ready the entirety of groon's posture has dropped and he just bows before you (cheering) at this point he takes a moment and closes his eyes and you can see there's this inner glow in his chest and a bunch of his wounds heal up in but an instant and as those wounds leave these scars he looks across the body i will wear these with pride at this point he groon's not even looking at you guys still looking at grog he goes you need not the strength of vasselheim to aid you nor is that strength any we have to give what you need can be found recovered reborn i can see in your face the path is already lying before you i know of two the rest you must find yourself a gift from kord himself to this mortal plane carved from the corpse of the earth primordial titan that fell on this continent in the first war these titanstone knuckles were a symbol of power and leadership for generations here in vasselheim until the last known keeper was slain 200 years ago the gauntlets taken i know not of their whereabouts the other leathers adorned by the champion of the raven queen this champion's tomb has since come to ruin sunken beneath a lake to the west of here known as the marrowglade loch within that tomb lies the deathwalker's ward now go you've found your strength you know your path i can help you no further he turns around walks back to the center of the sand and just sits back down in the same pose and position he was in when you entered okay all right no there's a difference between the healing and flushing one's system make a dexterity save keyleth (laughter) yeah as you see his cheeks fill with bile and liquid of your previous venture at the bar you instinctually as the mighty speed and reaction of an air-based ashari druid dodge out of the way as he spatters the stonework on the outside of this-- two of the monks immediately rush forward with towels out of seemingly nowhere and start quickly cleaning it up while staring at you very very angrily hey this is a place where i think either would work all right as you guys make your way outside of the trial forge we'll go ahead and leave today's venture for now-- (yelling) for a couple
