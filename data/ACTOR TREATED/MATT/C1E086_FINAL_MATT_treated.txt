that just came out that a couple of you assholes are in that was two days ago there ya go you got out of the house though bad movies no we had to sit quietly for an hour afterward just to take it all in including katana's needless arrival-- anyway this is not this night's game of d&d that's awesome yes we're just gonna be somewhere in a forest lost screaming to each other help so that's our future cultural heritage of ours last but not least quick little note due to the current difficulties with green cards and people that are in the country who weren't born here one of our fantastic crew members amandine unfortunately is having to leave and go back to switzerland this is her last episode of critical role she's been a tremendously amazing member of our team and we've loved having her here and we certainly know this is not the last we'll see of her but this'll be her last show for awhile so i just wanted to bring her out and say hi to the community real fast come here you've been amazing we all tried everyone here did our best but we're going to miss you terribly and you've been amazing yeah she's been kicking ass on set seriously so everyone send your love give your hearts out and yeah we'll look forward to seeing your adventures as you progress and we'll bring you back as soon as we can we'll find a way thank you yeah perfect we're coming to switzerland guys let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of critical role [opening credits] correct that is a very important fact (writing noises) and the hand seems to pick up speed and start rapidly whipping across the page-- (tearing paper noise) tears it out and presents it to you rather forcefully just over taryon's head and it is pretty fine calligraphy actually not that you can appreciate it it just looks like a god damn scribble (all laugh) the entire establishment pretty much is full except for a couple of individuals that you remember from before who are kind of masquerading as patrons but each while they have their drink in front of them they haven't touched it and they have their hand on the side of their sword belts at the bar there is nobody currently manning it and as this conversation's occurring you do see the familiar face of treev bonebreaker the bronze dragonborn who is the scarbearer head here within the facility turn the corner into the room it looks like he's wiping out what looks to be a large tankard as he kind of like gives it a shine and looks over well look at that it looks like they all returned it's not often you see folks who are at least trying to stick to their word one would recommend that yeah treev what's your name no who's this fucker laura taliesin and ah there's some fancy garb you're wearing  good to know anyway  he leans forward so what are you here to talk-- -- or drink  you here to talk he does a quick scan of the room it's my people and you might as well  okay and you do you find the mechanical digits of ripley plus some of them partially bent from the combat-- do you pass over the hand while this is happening you kind of slam it down on the table the giant bronze dragonborn claw reaches out and grabs it and rakes it forward picks it up and the fingers fall limp in the grasp and he turns it around in his vision (sniffs) it's a strange contraption certainly looks like a hand so you're telling me this is the one that took out the mistress asharru right right very well he takes the hand and begins scraping the pistol back with him as well all right well at least the mistress can lay at rest i thank you for your deed and he spins his finger in the air and one of the men at the table gets up and walks out of the room and exits through the front door behind you takes some balls to come back here and not have anything to show for it so glad you got balls all of you except for that one well i have called off my associates the hunt is null and void you're free to wander without worry stay for a drink certainly it's been kinda low-key here for the day all right anyone else  round it is and he goes and he gathers up a number of small mugs tankards it's ramshackle in here this essentially acts as a base of operations first and a tavern a distant second so it's barely functional really as a comparable establishment for fine drinks and atmosphere but it works yeah yeah the drinks are passed around some small talk's made with treev discussing just how things have been pretty low-key since asharru was killed and you guys last left there hasn't been an upset there was apparently a vision of some sort of a creature at the top of the cerulean palace a few days ago but people were wondering if that was a sighting of devo'ssa and some of the rather intense historians and younger believers in the myth of devo'ssa have been up in a tizzy and treev just kinda shrugs it off and takes a drink and goes just what we need is another bigger fucking dragon aye at which point doty crams in right behind and is dwarfing tary in size with the broad metallic shoulders and is (heavy footfalls) no response i did oh shit (all laugh) that's beautiful okay let me go look up the information that i emailed you you are from the city of diastock in the truscan empire of wildmount diastock in the truscan empire treev's already on it treev is like oh don't worry i'm loving this then he's just pouring all of you glasses and shoving them forward to you guys and crossing his arms we ain't got meat all right perception check go ahead okay good to know continue you guys have stepped away from the rest of the crowd as you guys watch-- tary kind of puts his arm on her shoulder-- leads her over to the corner a nice fistful of pristine platinum pieces in his grip you hear the scratching sound of quill on parchment as doty has arrived behind you and is now currently cataloguing the entire conversation (all laugh) go ahead and make an investigation check okay you've seen quite a few gold platinum pieces in your time this seems fairly legit it seems like it's been minted recently relative in the past maybe ten or so years it has not seen a lot of antiquing across its surface and most of the coin is branded in a way that emanates from the truscan empire it does appear to have wildmount origin if only it's roughly eight and a half feet tall a bit taller yeah i'd say a little larger than that it's kind of hunched forward as it walks it probably could stand taller if it wanted to not as broad it's tall but it's kind of lanky in its construction and it seems to be thicker at the feet and the arms and fists but the actual structure itself is proportionally pretty thin okay the eye that you have been keeping out you don't notice anyone giving chase or following you glancing over and getting a quick look-- make a perception check actually okay glancing over and giving a once over of the giant mechanical creature (footsteps) walking a few feet behind you you can see there are a lot of signs of repair you can see there are a lot of places where bits of metal have been re-hammered elements have been patched over and additional layers of armor have been added to it you do see what appear to be some scrapes and areas where it has sustained various weapon attacks that whole circumstance it looks like it's seen some scuffles in it's time yeah make an insight check hard to read for many reasons  okay investigation check what are you trying to ascertain about it best that you can tell from its construction and your understanding there is a lot of ingenuity in its design but it is it exists and moves through a combination of decent engineering and enchantment you can see very very faint engravings of various runic glyphs that are similar some of the ones that you saw on-- -- fassbender you guys make your way to the sand herald district and there you can see the distant towers of the cerulean place the large central one that leads up into the chamber of j'mon sa ord as you approach the outside you see the familiar faces and armor of the hands of ord there guarding the exterior of the palace walls as you approach one of the guards steps up with their same kind of brass and sapphire emblazoned armor and one of them approaches and steps forward i'm sorry do you have business at the palace  the guard takes the flute and-- the guard takes it and looks at it confused please to be patient for just a moment be pleased turns around and walks back up the stairs the front of the palace and enters through one of the side doorways about two three minutes pass the guards just keep a view out and then eventually you see an older woman in familiar ceremonial robes exit from the doorway that the guard went into this is the grand maven gameshega who you met and escorted you up into the palace originally she walks up with her bracelets still jingling as she steps down the stairs her long robes trailing behind her a good like two-three feet her headdress still has little brass quills that streak down past her shoulders into her mid-back and as she steps up it is good to see all of you once more i do not believe we have met i'm sorry what is your name taryon darrington friend of vox machina it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance so j'mon would like to extend their greetings to all of you and respect in the wake of the news of the destruction of the conclave you've aided in closing a far too lingering chapter in the history of marquet and the ruin of the cinder king thank you this information did make it to the ears of j'mon of course anything else of course my dear and she walks alongside you as you pull her off a little bit i can see what i can do what is the name of this gentleman there you go jarrett howarth okay i will go and take this into the archives discover and see what can be done yes should we be sending it to emon as well to whitestone okay very well we have not sent anything to whitestone before we will find a way to do so i will do this i apologize j'mon is not currently taking audiences but i will continue to pass this word onto them thank you very much and good day be pleased as the grand maven turns around and heads back up the stairs the guards take their place and the palace is at rest make a perception check uh best that you can tell here in the sand herald district no most everyone who wanders around here are of noble dress or part of the hand of ord all right as you find a familiar tree you can utilize to transport over to whitestone tary you watch as the center of this tree's trunk suddenly seems to split open with divine energy on the opposite side you watch this tunnel progress about four or five feet within where it just looks like the striations of the interior of the tree trunk before it emerges on the other side into another town square currently in the middle of an evening as you all tumble through the transport via plants spell you all emerge on the opposite side of the sun tree in the center of whitestone's courtyard what do you wish to do technically now that i think about it it would still be day because you guys left in the morning to ank'harel and you've been there for a few hours so it's early afternoon at this point yeah it's easy enough to find you head down to where the makeshift garrison which has now seen reconstruction actually being turned into a decent functional garrison within the town itself a lot of the guards are out there running through their drills for the afternoon and you can see jarrett is in the process of running them through what looks like ranged combat training as you approach jarett looks over and watches you walking up from a distance and kind of gives a wave hello so everything seems to be in order here i have to say i am very glad to know that we have no more dragons for quite some time and you see he's recovering he's healing but there is noticeable scarring on the side of his neck and it looks like he's going through the process of recovering from the thordak battle but he's doing much better than the last time you saw him to be perfectly honest very happy to not be anywhere near that terrible city i never thought i had the sense for the slower parts of the countryside but i don't know i've come to like it here in whitestone well i was intending to yes yes really you employ me so it is more up to you but i kind of like the change in temperature bit chillier up here north oh right really he doesn't look nervous at all he looks elated and is like well thank you i hope that comes to a fruitful end i've been living here long enough where it's not a huge deal to me but it would be nice to occasionally return-- yeah you know thank you i appreciate that i am sorry to hear that this is good to know well i look forward to his return that being the case can i ask a favor of you could you hold this and he reaches back and pulls out a small pouch and puts it in your hand i don't feel comfortable holding on to this it was requested by your small bard friend and i probably should not have it on my person yes one that you should not probably drink it's suude it's illegal you should not-- it is dangerous yes yes it is let's talk about it in front of everyone i'm training yes thank you don't do drugs no i procured them for him at his request (unconvincingly) no (all laugh) this was only the second i did not want to do this he is a very convincing person and looked like he was going through a hard time and look i understand that and i warned him he knew full well the dangers involved he's a much stronger man than i am who was i to tell him this and he's very persuasive not more than maybe a week or two ago yes it was burning a hole in my pocket and i don't want to hold onto it sorry i appreciate your understanding yes i should do that he turns around you lot heard nothing nock your crossbows nock-- (whack) and slaps one guy on the back of the head all right focus up on the targets and you hear him begin taking a few volleys off in the distance as you walk your way back to the castle the rest of you as you walk through whitestone taryon you watch this beautiful wonderfully slightly backwards city-- it's charming yeah and there's a castle they have a castle yeah your best bet at this point would be to make your way to the unclaimed gardens in the back of the castle for awhile there was no greenery back there the processing and disposing of the excess acids lead to the green fume that was billowing behind the castle when you first arrived here and destroyed most of the plant life through your aid and the people who kept the castle those have been filled in and it looks like the castle grounds are starting to recover there is now a fresh growing season of green back there and that is closed off it is protected there are guards around and it is away from the general populace of whitestone your insight skill travis i would like you to roll a deception oh wait no it's from you sorry yeah this is percival technically it's kind of both of you you get the sense that maybe not all the information is there it's not a lie but it's definitely-- it speaks of a half truth okay and you're going after doty with just your hands okay both you guys roll attack okay go ahead and do your sneak attack damage and double it cause you rolled a natural 20 you go ahead and roll for the backhand it's one-- it's just a backhand i would say it's one damage plus your strength modifier okay so nine damage yeah so it'd be nine okay yes yep to attack the person who attacked you after this round actually for the tension basis of this and for the arrangement for the circumstance i'm going to take a break and then come back to this so we can give this the real feel you want to so after this round all right so after-- okay so you do seven damage you backhand doty (impact sound)-- -- and the head turns to the side the tome falls to the ground open on the ground so the pages fold a little bit and the metallic creature (shifting metal) back to you stands up and now goes a full six inches taller than you and then rears back with its fist and right as it's about to swing it sees from behind vax creep up and hit-- how much damage 86 points of damage actually that's right yeah so even at your enlarged height you're still probably a good foot and a half two feet larger than doty yeah there you go as you're growing (robotic motion noises)-- goes to punch towards you however out of the corner of doty's eye sees this half-elf show up and whack him right square in the center of the neck and spinal column and then the fist just goes wide and slams toward you that is going to be a 23 to hit you suffer ooh 16 points of bludgeoning damage as the giant iron fist of doty just (whack) clangs into the back of your head and part of your ear and you feel the ringing in your skull from the impact you taryon fall to your knees-- -- and find a large portion of your vitality and breath and just general awareness knocked out of you from from one singular blow from nowhere your eyes go white for a second-- that was the surprise round because you were not aware of this circumstance we're going to continue combat after this break (cheers and laughter) oh yeah just so you're aware everyone who's watching you just watched your boyfriend cold-cock an innocent person all right just so you're aware all right guys-- this is pretty fucked up you guys (all laugh) all right we'll come back in a few minutes after we take a quick break to continue this combat we'll see you here shortly [break] i know i'm not surprised by any of you it's just-- oh no i am surprised i wasn't expecting it but it makes sense yeah exactly that being the case anyone who cares to get involved in this i need you to roll initiative would you have gone with him or would you have stayed back so yeah you wouldn't be there actually yeah you will be walking up towards the castle so there is no percival no keyleth in but you guys were-- okay percival's in yeah they're there yeah so vex is the only one who's not there okay so for those who are present and wish to be part of this roll initiative what have we got so we have okay percival you're up first as you watch grog backhand this mechanical entity in the face while vax appears from the shadows and just beans the back of taryon across the center of the neck and spinal column-- -- and he falls to his knee making this horrible horrible sound okay grog yeah doty just (twang) and looked back at you slowly unblinking mechanical face right here about five feet from you that's all you do okay that's grog's turn keyleth like an arena okay suddenly the wind kicks up around (heavy wind) the leaves and various fallen parts of the greenery around here kick up into this torrent around you as the wind is now creating a barrier around the battlefield okay what level level two all right 2d4 plus six plus six for your wisdom so it's 13 vax what are you doing (all laugh) all right and you move back away from him how far 30 feet no out of the nose you did 88 damage to him from behind with the back of your dagger there is blood out of his nose out of his ears understand you critically hit him from behind to do 88 points of damage that would have killed a regular human being or at least have put them in a-- he's not like bleeding out but he looks rough (all laugh) no sam what are you doing actually grog is not directly in a melee with you so grog does not all the way around to here so just past doty (whoosh) as a familiar and previously prevented blast of rainbow arcane energy comes shooting forth from taryon's hand hitting grog keyleth and percival i need you all to make a dexterity saving throw you do because of your cloak what's the dc on that yes on the helmet okay okay so both of you guys halve the damage grog does not okay got you i'm going to go ahead and do this actually you get to roll if you want to so it's 10d6 damage okay i did roll for that one just in case so-- i'm gonna figure that out here in just a minute 41 damage however against you percy that is 41 points of poison damage to you reduced to 20 reduced to ten and your charges are still full regardless keyleth you take 41 points of fire damage halved to 20 so 20 points of fire damage as the red beam hits you and the flames just burn across the front of your hair blown back from the blast of the heat percival you feel the sickly ray of the poison splatter past and cover your skin with this semi-translucent poisonous liquid grog you take 41 points of cold damage you do so you take 20 points of cold damage from that so the beam subsides and you see them all blasted with it but they're still standing perturbed by it and doty's at the ready (metal hitting metal) what do you want doty to do (laughing) yeah i love it all right so sanctuary on you and what do you want to tell doty to do (metal grinding and a heavy force swinging) and is going to go in for  the giant fist hit towards you that is going to be a 17 to hit what's your ac all right that hits and then after the fist comes back and smacks you in the face across the jaw for nine plus five-- 14 points of bludgeoning damage the hand grabs the front your clavicle pulls back and attempts to headbutt you that's a natural 20 that is 14-- that is 19 points of bludgeoning damage so halved to nine that's right so-- yeah so 19 points of bludgeoning damage as doty just (clang) slams you right in the middle of the face you feel the nose kinda (cracking noise) from the break and the blood getting gushed from your nostrils from the headbutt all right that ends doty's turn sanctuary's on you next up top of the round percival okay so you're holding until he fiddles with an object okay that brings it to grog okay bonus action rage okay you weren't in combat with him oh i see so you go this way okay great i will say doty does get an attack of opportunity on you as you pull out of the way that is a nine that does not hit you (whoosh) just too slow and too wide as the rage kinda instills you with adrenaline and you dodge past all right that's your turn okay keyleth next to tary okay okay make a wisdom saving throw yes make a wisdom saving throw any attack or spell that targets the warded creature with an attack so yes what's your spell dc tary okay so yeah go ahead and roll your fireball damage tary i'm gonna need you to make a dexterity saving throw dexterity saving throw please okay go ahead and roll damage if you don't mind keyleth (laughs) 8d6 points of damage 8d6 points of fire damage yes you hear the distant-- as you're walking up towards the front of the castle you see suddenly this blast of multicolored arcane energy just (shhhh) out from over the castle wall you start running through the castle okay probably otherwise you'd-- okay so you immediately take the broom slam it under and begin flying at dash speed it'll still take you a couple rounds to get there and as you begin to crest up you see a fiery explosion in the middle of the courtyard now okay no so it's 34 points of fire damage okay vax it is your turn and as you come up over the outside perimeter wall of castle whitestone you watch as the wind that is whipping around slowly subsides and there in the center of the courtyard you see the rest of your friends encircling taryon darrington who is currently on one knee almost and looks a little worse for wear sure in the middle of this conversation you watch out of the corner of your eye taryon-- i know but he looks over because they're all facing him and he looks up and sees you arcing over the top of the wall and suddenly there's a flash of dark energy and a large bear an armored bear rolls out and just breaks into the center of everyone here as taryon's pulling back and now roars and trinket is still holding this aggressive stance to the rest of you just in the vicinity and looks a little more confused and just sits down it stings a lot trinket's head pokes just into frame to you taryon and he goes (licks) which for the record you now look over and doty has been writing all this down (all laugh) (sounds of doty ripping and crumpling paper) (sounds of book slamming shut and doty walking) (chuckles) as doty follows you you guys make your way into the castle wine bottles are brought about and a raucous evening of drinking is easily found the barn-burner you're looking for shaun is able to be mustered jarrett kima's still back in emon and actually allura is in town briefly to retrieve pike and as pike comes in she reaches you guys hi apparently there's still a lot of recovery that's needed in emon and they need kind of an all-hands-on-deck circumstance with anyone who's trained in healing so i may have to go help with that for a little bit if that's okay i mean don't-- don't go-- (sigh) don't go to any crazy hell places without me let me know before that happens please i mean try and at least let me know it's fine go i mean i don't know how much help i'll be other than just getting you there but there's plenty of people that can you know helm a ship and get you across the sea hire a good crew really i was but one of many and everything i learned i learned from watching other people you might learn more than i didokay i could use the distraction to be honest you'll be fine i mean it's all tying up loose ends and i'm more needed helping people that really need what i can do right now it won't be long they're gathering a lot of great healers i know keeper yennen's coming along-- -- and we're gonna be doing some people some real good might even bring the love of my lady to a few people her light can definitely heal a lot of wounds and spirits so she pulls back from you and kind of pats you on the side of your face she lets go of allura's hand runs up real fast and just slugs you in the face-- -- and jumps into your arms ohh i will okay bye she turns around and runs back to allura after yennen is summoned forth the three of them vanish into a swirl of arcane energy towards the direction of emon yeah yeah it does not bad news contraption it is empty what are you thinking of while you reach in there does he find candy nope it's just a void an empty sack the weapon is near him but not currently on him you watch as your hammer just ignites with flame it burns your hand (all laugh) yeah it hurts the two of them as you guys are having this conversation without realizing it slowly exit together right then you stop yourself as you reach the door okay the waitstaff come in and retrieve your belongings and lead you up to the chamber that'll be prepared for your evening all right as the rest of you wind down the evening drinking perusing the treasury reading the various books that are at your disposal-- yeah you find your evening to a close you enjoy the time to relax a bit and take another breath of air after this constant pressure that's been pushing you next morning comes in as the sun rises you all come to consciousness rouse yourselves for breakfast and whatever the next day ensues you all begin to gather in the common room of the castle once more yep all healed up you vaguely know that it exists somewhere in the ozmit sea kind of south-ish from tal'dorei but you don't really know maybe a little bit of information-gathering or asking people who may traverse that area would help you but you don't really know pretty landlocked in whitest-- yeah you have the lucidian ocean to the east of you but it is a very treacherous water and the shearing channel that is the series of broken land mass between here and wildmount the one that the briarwoods were brokering the bridge for is-- yeah uh there's stillben very very far south but that is still out to the lucidian ocean east the ozmit sea is on the western side of the continent emon is the closest port city to head to the ozmit sea the earth ashari are kind of northern like mid-northern of the continent they're in the cliffkeep mountains yes it is ask me it's been my life for the past year writing all this down for a book for all you guys uh on this continent yes you don't know i mean a lot of that part of the town is just now being rebuilt and recovered so-- you have not checked in on the airship you guys-- the last time you saw them was in the throes of the battle with thordak when they came in and gave it a helping hand briefly yes make a history check it's not terrible but your research hasn't delved too deeply into the ashari and the ashari that you do know of are the terra and uh and the air ashari there's the terra and the zephra those are the only two you know about those are the only two on the continent the vesrah you're not too familiar with it's in essentially a heavy valley of stone in the center of the cliffkeep mountain range it is far from civilization it's maybe a few days of heavy mountain-- constant hiking north of where kraghammer is there are a couple that aren't too far outside of terra that you can tree stride to yeah yes i'm saying that there are some that are like just in the outskirts of terra none directly in it all righty so as you guys are taking through the-- you find grog off to the side make an insight check it's a lot of words it's a lot of words but you got your deck back you-- it's really confusing she's talking at you but nothing changed okay you guys head up to scanlan's room both you guys make investigation checks together you both see-- you both spend the better part of an hour thumbing through the various drawers and odd boxes and sundries that were left behind in the wake of scanlan's departure and at the same time you both come to find that no there are-- no illegal substances remain honestly there are no nudey pictures per se you do find a series of books on art and the human physique and all the corresponding images have been torn out all right you've joined the rest of the party the rest of-- after you guys finish your perusal of the workshop which is quite a workshop mundane in a lot of ways but functional for the basic purposes of tinkering you guys gather up-- together prepare yourselves for what the next step of your journey is what are you doing okay all right (laughs) you guys find your way to the sun tree utilizing transport via plants you find yourself (teleportation sound) thrust through the trunk of the sun tree and emerging on the opposite side on the cusp of a deep bowl-like valley that goes probably for a good mile and a half or two miles across before you reach the other side of this crest central cliffkeep you glance around and there are the edges of a forest here a lot of them are stockier trees and things that live in harsh environments and a lot of them are rooted in cracks in the ground and portions of the rock that have split open down within this valley you can already see what appear to be dozens and dozens of trenches that seem to have been dug and there are areas of this valley that appear to have eroded or collapsed like small long rockslides that are just kind of dotting the edges of the mountain walls down towards the center you can see also a cluster of dozens and dozens of small abodes it looks like homes huts structures made of rock this is terra this is the earth ashari village here currently guarding over the localized rift to the earth elemental plane you guys are traversing down into it it takes you a short time you find one of the paths that kinda zigzags down the side of this mountain drop and make your way in towards the center the sun is now-- i'd say at this time just over the very top kind of noon-ish portion of the day you begin to walk your way in and it's very warm here partially because the-- it's northern enough where usually it's a colder temperature on the island-- don't you even you motherfucker i'm a little sensitive (all laugh) disadvantage on the next roll (all laugh) exactly yeah so as you continue downward you get maybe a quarter-mile into this walk still relatively far from the village before-- and you recognize this you watch as one of the nearby trenches (earth moving) shifts up about two feet in stone and you watch as three figures step out from within the trench and begin walking towards you okay you watch as three humanoids approach they are clad in darkened leathers furs and it looks like a lot of the armor and garb here is taken from hunted creatures and animals that have been prepared and tanned here within the sun-wracked center of this mountain valley the two to the-- flanking the central figure appear to be human male and female both very short kind of tossed hair then at the center you see what appears to be a surprisingly short but very stocky and thick half orc female as she approaches she has-- the hair is woven back into these thick braids that are pulled into a singular what looks like a topknot on the upper back of her skull her jaw protrudes a bit you can see the two lower fangs kinda pushing past the lips no this is-- this is rockcaller dryden dryden you do this is not the headmaster of the tribe but one of the central sentinels that's around this portion here approaches you and for a moment puts a hand out almost to hail you and then recognizes your face and steps forward keyleth what brings you to terra kaitiaki we are well we have hunkered down our business was to make sure that no more of the rifts befall the same fate of the pyrah not recently no then this is a time for celebration i will pass this along perhaps but what do you wish to speak on to the vesrah very well i could help you with this information if need be no no right this way very well they turn around and begin to lead you back towards the outskirts of the city not directly into terra itself but as you approach and walk past you can see the ground here-- every ten minutes or so you feel a sudden shift and a slight quake beneath your feet the landscape here the closer you walk to the center of the village seems to be in this perpetual state of shifting rock and you watch as different areas kind of collide areas of stone kind of (cracking noise) and rocks tumble down parts of it break and crack and reform at one point as you guys are not maybe 200 feet out from the first major structures the ground has one major spike (loud rock slide) and you hear this heavy rolling rumble and you watch as maybe 300 feet off from the side a new pinnacle is formed two big plates kind of (crack) jut upward one kind of coasting over the other and coming to a halt there is very heavy localized seismic activity as part of the proximity to the rift of the earth elemental plane here and you watch as three druids come rushing out of the side of the terra tribe and as they focus the rocks (crumbling noises) crumble back down and subside the central mountain landscape here brought back to a momentary beat of peace and quiet yeah just going straight in right as you progress inward and some of the other terra ashari-- different visual representations some appear to be more ornamental jewelry seems to be here like jewels and metallics used it seems to connote a level of prestige within the tribe and every individual that walks usually with a cluster or protectors around them or at least seems to be in a place of notable importance within groups seems to be more adorned in this natural-based jewelry you know exactly where to go to head straight to the hut in which the headmaster resides and as-- what looks to be a heavy wooden doorway built out of a series of tree trunks that are strapped to this one area just (tree trunks shifting) shifts open and now you see walks a very tall thin and older like mid-60s human male who is adorned in a similar tattoo pattern as the rockcaller you saw earlier but it seems to reside from the center of the cheeks and through the jowls and then crosses across the neck and then across the arms all the way down to the fingertips and there are certain portions which are broken up by hard lines it's like this parallel intersection multiple times as the tattoo progresses down very very loose almost a flowing central shoulder-based robe that tosses down the front of the body and meets with a long skirt that drags behind him as he steps out and as he looks over in the direction of you you can see the eyes are very hardened dark deep brown in color and the sockets are very weathered his skin texture in general is pretty weathered he looks over towards you clean-shaven short white hair puts a hand up keyleth you grace the terra with your presence what can we be of service to you for you as well everything seems to be fine we've been intent of care to the rift and from the word that seems to have passed quickly since your arrival over the past few days it's come to our attention that thordak no longer sits in the center of the city of emon good good and well done you are but a seed you allowed it to germinate so what do you need it has been a long time since i've attended any sort of gathering with the vesrah it is for people of our skill set not the easiest of journeys as many of us are capable of traversing through the sentinels of nature unfortunately most of the tree life that exists around vesrah is beneath the water so your most likely form of transport will be that of a vessel across the waves the headmaster there-- uvenda the heart of the tides uvenda not what you'd expect i'll leave it at that well what would be the fun if i were to unveil the next fold of your aramente if you have the means that is up to you listen closely keep your friends about you that should be sufficient good keep it that way they don't live beneath the water not entirely some of them yes it's not the island of usual appearance the beaches and sands of vesrah are built upon a great circular reef and part of the city lies above part of it lies below look for the white sands beneath the surface some structures will be visible from above it would lie quite a ways to the southwest not too far from the hespit i would recommend perhaps procuring the service of someone who knows the sea well no just do your best to have your friends keep the location of our village to themselves good i trust you all safe journeys keep her safe the tempest needs a new voice kaitiaki young keyleth (coughs) you go into an immediate coughing fit as the-- -- the surface dirt here is built from constant colliding of stone and rock and a lot of it has been ground to almost a fine powder in places-- -- yeah yeah it's akin to the cinnamon challenge in a way (all laugh) okay it feels much better emon he does it's-- (all laugh) yeah i'm so excited that worked out all right so-- you find your way back to the edge of the valley to the same tree that you made your transport via plants through-- pointing out what is your destination tree okay you transport from the outskirts of terra find your way back to greyskull keep and walking towards emon proper you can see now even from the distance as you approach the walls some of the larger buildings the higher towers and structures that just barely peek over the wall you can see are already in the process of repair you can see-- -- teams of people that are in-- currently trying to rebuild and restructure as you enter from the southern gates of the city and enter the streets it's more lively than you've ever seen it people are returning people are coming back and reclaiming what remains of their homesteads many of them still intact without a problem the damage was extensive but not universal in the city and so i'd say there's still a good 60% to 70% of the city that is mostly without damage and there are areas that are just destroyed but even those people are picking up reclaiming-- there appears to be a process of memorial being constructed on the outskirts of the cloudtop to remember those who fell in the battle for emon there is also the skyport which was on the outskirts of the cloudtop and up there you can see the skyship deera however it looks to have sustained a severe amount of damage-- -- in the battle and is in the process of also receiving its own repairs there you go now he's dangerous damon yeah all right so what are you guys doing pike is in the city somewhere you haven't found her you don't know where she is pike had one crew that she travelled with on the ocean-- but that crew i will say for the sake of time is not currently docked at emon yeah you find yourself at the western docks of emon you hear the familiar sound of seagulls and other water-based fowl mixed with the creaking of wood from large ships that are all making their way in and out of this rather large port here on the side of the ozmit sea you can see there's a lot of goods coming into the city now as a lot of heavy orders have come from nearby villages to transport goods as part of the recovery both from the south from the mornset as well as things that were too large to carry by cart from syngorn and have been coming up along the coast avoiding dagger bay and making their way up to emon there are a number of individuals around and who would want to spearhead the investigation-- roll an investigation check asking about for a while you eventually-- people point you in the direction of what appears to be an individual named dockmaster abban abban a-b-b-a-n you're eventually led to this individual who pointed out is dressed simply at first glance the clothing he wears just a plain white billowing shirt nice tailored pants and some boots that go just up to the mid-calf dark brown-red skin completely shaved smooth bald shining in the sun no facial hair with piercing blue-grey eyes as soon as you begin to approach he's finishing a conversation with someone and turns to you and flashes the brightest of white smiles and goes hello ah you look like you are looking for some help or in aid of something yes no you're staring at me what do you want i have noticed it strangely enough i've watched it be saved and-- well are you looking for a-- to purchase a vessel i guess it really depends on the size of the vessel you're taking-- what ship do you have okay and where are you travelling how close to the hespits i have-- i apologise i do not follow this train of thought discount no you-- okay vax walks away before he finishes his point and doesn't get to make his roll okay what all right i'm still very confused here you're asking for a discount why because the city was saved look i don't know who you are i don't know what you're trying to do here-- --but we're in the process of trying to recover the economy of what was once a very strong economy of a town that has been under attack now we cannot offer discounts to anybody because right now we're all in financial dire straits so if you're going to ship if you're going to move if you're going to charter if you're going to purchase it's going to have to be the ask-- captain adella that would be your best bet now and he points off to the end of one of the nearest docks there's two that are close by and there's a long row of various ships that are in the process of being loaded and unloaded but there appears to be one sailing ship they have some galleys and long-ships along the side but there's a sailing ship with the sails currently tied up and bound to the mast and a crew that is lounging on the deck there is a woman towards the edge that's just walking past you cannot make out a lot of details from this point but he points over that is captain adella she will be able to help you of course now if you wish to charter speak with her let her know that the dockmaster is the one that brought you that point and all shall be well all right good luck travel safe and he turns around and walks aw-- oh well it depends on the ship that you are looking for for a long-ship no crew of course which is a fairly decent speed requires maybe 30 to 40 rowers and a handful of deck hands that would run you about 10000 gold pieces are you talking about a fully outfitted galleon i would put that well i mean the crew you'd have to pay whatever they're asking but for the actual ship the general asking price can range somewhere in around 30000 to 40000 gold pieces right obviously a man of the world all righty as you guys walk to the edge of the-- --aforementioned dock that was pointed out you come to the outskirts of this larger sailing ship and as you begin to walk up and your footfalls 'clack-clack clack-clack clack' against the dock a couple of the deckhands that are kind of leaning off to the side kind of just looking up one of them appears to be taking a hit off of a flask of some kind both hear the footfalls and get up and turn around spin and look cap'n cap'n and they kind of point over and the coat-wearing figure that you saw walking across the deck of the ship spins around and begins to abruptly quicken her pace in the direction of the gangplank that leads off onto the side of the dock as she comes up to the edge reaching and grabbing the sides of it you see before you a woman with long sea-air tattered mass of hair it is just this halo of crimped curled and wild dark hair that's also been sun-bleached to the point where the tips kinda go light it is crazed in appearance immediately as she arrives she looks spry and somewhat young maybe late 20s early 30s but her skin has been very heavily weathered from all these days at sea and you can see already she's getting these crows nests at the corners of her face but has a very bright smile and her light brown coat hangs just past her calf-high boots she looks like the kind of woman who captains a ship as she glances over hi you looking for a crew i do not look like a pirate why would you say that are you looking for a crew or not yes (laughs) i see my reputation precedes me quite a bit actually i do where you looking to go no we don't travel to the hespit that's-- vesrah i know of i know of it how worth your while well we have a crew here 12 deckhands my captaining and navigating skills a first mate and the use of the ship that would run you-- let's put it at 150 gold per day for chartering the ship (laughs) well this has certainly got real interesting didn't it all right so have we a deal all right so fine you've found yourself a leader a captain and a partner shakes your hand so vesrah you say crazy water folk who am i to judge but yes six to seven days travel at sea depending on the weather of course storms are common this time of year do keep in mind we will be passing north of the hespit so be wary of any wandering bandit ships or pirates you can call them pirates as well but we already had that conversation nope not anymore oh we've got some ballistae we travel with speed fast ship often enough that's adorable well welcome to my ship she is called the drensala vis-- it is marquesian for luck of the mother treat her well and she'll treat you well in kind respect my crew respect my authority respect our direction and we'll do just fine so to the crazy water people welcome on board the drensala vis you imagine the enchantment probably is waterproof right now it's a little bit past three o'clock in the afternoon yes well we leave at your leisure but we're not against the idea of a raucous final evening at the local tavern not including for my crew we have bunks for at least 15 other passengers between the bunks six rooms two or three depending if you don't find-- good grab your things on this ship let's set sail starts giving out orders to her crew seems to now kind of come to life and they're starting to go ahead and start pulling up anchor they're starting to get the sails ready you already can feel the spray of the water as the tide's coming in now the water's starting to get a little choppier as it's hitting up against the side of the docks and the shore end doty stops for a second leans back and then starts scribbling furiously at anything that he can pick up within earshot eventually the ship disembarks and begins making its way further out into the water just as the sun begins to set into the slightly orange purple and dark blues of the end of daylight you can see the various lights in emon come on especially towards the dock as the night comes to life and out the opposite side the sparse clouds that are scattered in the distance the ship picks up the winds and pushes with guiding speed out to the southwest into the depths of the ozmit sea and that's where we'll pick up next session i finally get to use the ocean voyage audio (all cheer) awesome that took some interesting turns tonight pretty much yeah pike's still back at home ashley come back to us blindspot stop filming you finished your season right we'll get her back guys thank you so much
