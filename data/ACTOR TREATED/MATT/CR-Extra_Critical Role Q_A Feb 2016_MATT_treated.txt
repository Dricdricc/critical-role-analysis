hello everyone and welcome to tonight's pseudo not-really episode of critical role where a bunch of nerdy voice actors sit around here and tonight maybe play a little bit of dungeons & dragons my name is matthew mercer and unfortunately we have a number of members who were sick after our convention appearances this last weekend who couldn't make the game tonight due to unfortunate circumstances so with the amount of people who couldn't make it we decided to instead not play this week and instead do a live q&a with the questions in the chat room and as well as questions that were put on reddit so we'll get to those there in just a moment and then when that's over as decided recently i'm going to have a fun battle royale i made a small arena and the latter half of today's episode is going to be grog versus keyleth versus zahra versus kashaw free-for-all see who stands winning at the end of this show i cannot wait so that will be the second half of the show after we take our midway break before that happens let's do a quick round of announcements first and foremost i wanted to say thank you to our critters and fans that came out to wizard world portland this past weekend we had an incredible turnout wizard world was very happy and we're looking to possibly be doing more of those in the near future so we'll be able to see other parts of the us meet more of you guys we didn't have the chance to that weekend it's wonderful to meet all of you both at the con and at guardian games out there it was a great game store we got to hang out with a bunch of you in person but thank you so much for coming out and visiting we really appreciate it also today i put up on the dungeons masters guild site dmsguildcom a new order for the blood hunter class it's called order of the lycan which i mentioned a little bit at wizard world but it's essentially a blood hunter order that involves as part of a ritual called the taming they accept the lycanthropic curse and through training and honing their willpower and the blood magic that is part of blood hunters' training they can control the curse of lycanthropy to a certain extent to prevent themselves from going berserk but still reap the benefits as they transform into whatever were-creature they choose-- i mean there's were-tigers were-rat so you decide which strain you're infected with no you're locked to the strain of lycanthropy you are unless you get uncursed and you get another strain no you're like big ass nasty-- --warhammer skaven style it's pretty rad yeah bigger than that but yeah it's on the dms guild site it's free go check it out see if it's something you guys want check it out it's good also another announcement i want to make real fast i'm saying this because i've gotten 15 to 20 tweets a day about it for the earthbreaker groon fight last week it was intentional that the quivering palm ability was held back he was testing individuals in the battle not trying to go lethal or kill it was more of a tease for the actual ability god forbid they ever come across a not quite as helpful or restrained monk in the future but i'm well aware it was intentional i should've made it more clear that he was holding back in the moment and i apologize for the confusion it caused yeah yeah i'm just trying to quell it now because it's been perpetual and i'm like i know it's all good it was a good fight i love me some monks man it was so great to bring a monk in there and more hopefully to come because there are those in the world that are trained for different sets yeah house rules rules are fluid you have a good time but don't worry about it i know that you guys want to see it come out in all its full glory and that may still happen in the future we shall see i mean you could multiclass the quivering snarf that's a great romance novel descriptor as he lies there his quivering snarf in the moonlight-- all right so that i think is all my announcements you guys have anything else you want to talk about before we jump into the q&a fantastic go check him out there and me and marisha-- we leave next week we'll be gone from the 2nd to the 9th in ireland we'll be at a convention at kaizoku con in cork ireland which-- kaizoku con in cork ireland kaizoku con in cork ireland kaizuku con in cork-- no (screaming) that's a problem but yeah so there will not be an episode next week because we'll be gone but we'll be returning to the next proper session which will also have the return of will and mary as well to finish off that arc on march 10th i believe so we'll be doing that anything else you good oh that's right and we'll be giving away two copies of these books throughout tonight brandon sanderson's the bands of mourning that is not me on the cover as the internet likes to perpetually point out yeah thank you brandon sanderson for bringing us our main artist on critical role so yeah we'll be giving these out throughout the show tonight-- do it they can you can certainly try i'm not either but i've worn before it's for everybody yeah marisha all right so that being the case the first half of this evening is going to be a general q&a guys we're going to be poring through the reddit we're going to be trying to keep up with the chat room to answer what questions we can so feel free if you see something come by the chat room on the side there guys if you caught something that seems like a fun question to answer feel free to jump out and take it if somebody's in the middle of explaining-- great ryan will be helping with this there it goes we're going to pull her real fast see if you guys say hi to wendy she is one of our official critical role artists she did all the artwork for our fantastic story of vox machina pre-stream video and for the show ryan you want to start throwing questions out perfect in the meantime i'll start with some-- some of the reddit questions we have ready to go pregosfearstaircases on reddit what does the pcs do for prep i notice dry erase markers for temporary hit points do they lay out their spell cards or have them typed up on one page what do you guys do to prep for a game the classic school argument and every now and then we still get a wind walk as much as we prep we still sometimes don't get it right per week i put at least as much time in prep as we do playing so from like three four hours plus a week into prepping for each one of our games that involves not just prepping for that session but also writing ahead planning for future elements that might tie into events seeing how things that happened last session will affect ripple down the line and trying to make sure that i'm not completely caught off-guard not that it ever helps i'm always completely caught off-guard but it makes me feel better and sleep at night during the week it's like having a wave of clippy the paperclip um it looks to me like you're trying to use reckless attacks yeah same way where you choose the ones you have memorized prepared and then you can choose from that list now that's my high school nightmare wil wheaton in my ear the whole time all right so see if we can find another question coming up here good to know it's an interesting balance for the show because for critical role it's the story of vox machina i'm trying to not turn it into a guest-of-the-week show this is why i'm very sparing with storylines and bringing guests in you guys i brought in for the slayer's take and this was the right time to bring you guys back for a bit we'll have a couple more guests coming in next month it looks like but i don't want to make it too constant we may have you in as a guest in the future it may not be very soon but it's good to know that you're interested okay yeah we will have guests occasionally occasionally because this is the story of the core party we could do a spinoff with guests only or something i don't know there's no dungeon master that would be amazing let's see this is an interesting question from raquem on reddit do you or anyone ever get tired of this being broadcast and wish you could go back to your more personal game while a lot of good has come out of critical role in terms of exposure do you find the invasive nature of the internet to be difficult to handle would you have a problem saying okay we're done now thanks geek and sundry thanks everyone and see you later that was our fear when we first started the show and it was a very real fear because taking something that's so personal to us and putting it on the internet is one a risk two a danger having the internet come out and set fire to it and tell you that your fun is wrong i don't speak for everyone here but while that was our fear in practice i'm pleasantly surprised that was never the case the community that's sprung out of this is so supportive and so positive even the exceptions are people that are passionate enough to want a voice and to feel involved there's not the hate that we were expecting from it and it hasn't really changed how we play the game or our experience with it we enjoy it just the same it may not be as close physically and the map proximity to the players is something we're still working on getting better but other than that-- that's more the case if there was a live audience it's hard not to and as a stage performer you draw energy from the audience and it's a mutual sharing it's become a layer of it i wouldn't say it's impeded or changed our experience at least not for me but there would be catching up on shit you did during the week this is true it's a lot of luck that we had those relationships beforehand and making that momentum in the game before we put it on camera what things may have changed have been so minimal by comparison that i haven't noticed too much of a difference personally i've done it on camera that will be one of my shining moments of my entire career was looking over at vin fucking diesel this burly fast and furious guy i shook his hand when he got there i was like hi that was the defining moment watching that arrive he was so nice and so cordial and so much fun and open to it and then he sat down and as soon as we started looking over and seeing this burly man turn into an eight-year-old-- his luck was ridiculous we only had 25 minutes to play that game which they cut down from an hour when we got there i was like okay i was so afraid he would roll shitty and have a terrible time but he rolled really well and i was like yes thank you travis do you and laura even break into character at home during stressful situations to lighten the mood hope you feel better ryan do we have any burning questions in the chat room do you want to toss one out toss one out there we can maybe tackle also viable but i like hearing your voice far far far far the negative is so comparatively miniscule in comparison to that positive energy that you guys continuously generate not just around the show but this entire twitch channel and everyone that works hard on it it's been overwhelming that was my biggest fear that the internet was going to come in and go no and stab me in the chest don't do that please no i've already answered the question from my perspective it's been so overwhelmingly positive you guys are so invested in the play time to have this much passion to yell about it's not just artwork too there's people that have produced incredible musical tracks many of which i've actually incorporated in our in-game soundtracks people that have sent fanfiction and have gotten into writing heavily some of them because of the show people tell us i haven't written in 15 years and after watching the show i'm working on a new novel it's much bigger than us at this point it's music it's doing what you love and inspiring other people to do what they love and there are many people that inspired me to do this and things before this and it's great to continue that chain to do honor to those that inspire me to continue to do the things that i love and hopefully continue that chain mikandi's in the middle east we have people all over the world it's incredible and people creating their own adventures and sending us pictures and stories from their own home games and art of their characters it's so cool it feels like-- i mentioned this at portland-- it feels like being part of fight club i was going through tsa when we were coming back from portland oregon i'm going through tsa and the guy comes out with the laptop because it gets picked up from the side and the guy has the gloves on and he pulls it off and looks at it and hands it back to me and goes here you go also had to stop your buddy scanlan earlier i was like what and i go back and sam who had already gone through tells me that yeah he had some of his checked and the guy hands it to him and goes your bag scanlan shorthalt (laughter) yeah the hollywood pantages so hi if it's you i had a bartender at the echoplex when we were there for booty la one night and i went to order some drinks and he goes sure do you play dungeons & dragons on the internet it was awesome next question are there any you've chosen there you can go either way i would recommend if you haven't played before and have any level of self-consciousness about it try and find friends and people you're comfortable with to try it out for the first time if you don't find that much of a social problem with engaging new things with people you don't know you can definitely give it a shot and if it turns out not being your thing if it's at a premade game with strangers then you can go back and try and find friends to play and if your friends are like i don't know how d&d works send them an episode of critical role wednesday nights that's a good question someone asked how did you guys decide on the name critical role for the show i think that was actually a liam suggestion wasn't it you and liam were doing a few on that one nothing but doors doors forever i can't remember some of the ones we had but critical role was the one that seemed to best encompass who we are where we come from and it plays in with the rpg theme but also role-play and us being actors who play roles for a living it put everything together what we were so that one stood out there's a lot of rpg-based names that already exist strangely no twitter has proven that wrong it's so good there was that and i remember named after that you guys purchased an ox at one of the small towns on your way out to emon it was near westruun you purchased an ox that was useless and you named it dork the ox speak to animals the ox was just like-- it was similar to you interrogating the cows in the later episode you learned so much from the first time as you started to travel because dork doesn't travel very well grog took it upon himself to find a way to cram him into the bag of holding which took a series of strength checks and tensile checks to see that the bag didn't burst in the process he wasn't a huge ox but he was still growing up managed to push him in there and this was also the sad lesson when they reached the next town to realize that the bag of holding does not have a perpetual air supply and that was the end of dork the ox oh man what are some other great moments from pre-stream the most serious one was pike's death pike being killed in the throne room i think your artwork in the pre-stream video wonderfully done with the shadow against the wall yeah that was the glabrezu the treachery demon getting the killing blow on pike as the whole party watched on and crumpled to their knees well allura's tower has a specific magical defense where it can crush itself into a small extra-dimensional space and then rebuild itself however the recent attack on the tower was not part of the defense mechanism that was vorugal actually destroying the tower so what you saw recently in emon was the end of allura's tower which is unfortunate great question here and this pertains to you and technically you romance between player characters is not something you see in a lot of games this is by gore ax on reddit liam said in an interview that he approached you first about the possibility of adding romance to the game what advice did you give to him or would you give to dms and players about that subject also since you knew about vax's interest in keyleth months before marisha did that ever create an awkward moment that you had to play dumb about it interesting question i think romance in game is an interesting storytelling facet i think it's been a phenomenal thread in our game and it's driven a lot of great character moments and it's brought some needed realism to both vax and keyleth's relationship it's been really cool you do have to be respectful and you have to make sure that the game group is mature enough to handle that that would involve one talking with the players and the dm before it happens in this situation liam talked to me without talking to marisha because he wasn't sure if he wanted to pursue it or not he just wanted to make sure it wouldn't be weird for me and as we're actors and we trust we understand the separation between character and ourselves that was never an issue i was very comfortable with liam but not all games will be like that and some people might have jealousy issues so you want to make sure before you even pursue anything like that that you talk to everyone involved and make sure that it's cool it's not necessary and it can be a really cool facet if everybody treats it like that and romance doesn't have to be a very melodramatic thing either it could be an element of the flavor it could be a flirtation you carry on and is an off-camera thing that gets mentioned here and there it doesn't have to be that you sit there at the precipice of a cliff declaring your love for 30 minutes while the other players gag themselves in the corner no it was a great moment i knew you were leaving (laughter) it's cool too because some romances succeed and become a cool driving moment for the character to try and protect the one they care about many romances fail and end up leading to an interesting tension between the characters i'm excited to see where this goes because it could go either way there's been a lot of interesting perspectives here what i like about your guys' romance is it's very realistic in the sense that it isn't an immediate grasping each other and it's perfect both of you are broken people and you're both trying to still figure out whatever this is and keyleth's very unsure and you're both feeling out the circumstance in the midst of this apocalyptic chaos i find it fascinating everyone's like oh are they going to go and bang i'm like no not where they are as people they're both so hurt and feeling so sad and alone that they need that comfort of somebody else there to hold them that artwork i felt was a great encapsulation of that i like that if you guys see any questions by the way that you want to reach out and grab feel free to or we could look through some of these papers that's awesome clover's awesome you bask in the glory of those so well this question here matt does anyone in the game have a deck of many things no and if i can help it they never will oh good luck guys deck of many things is what you throw in the game when you're bored and want to get it over with yeah my preparation is pretty-- a lot of my notes are narrative points and bullet points i'll choose whatever locations they might possibly go to i'll list what npcs are there and what their current circumstance is i will then bullet-point important bits of information that npc might know based on certain topics that are relevant to the current storyline and have that there for quick reference a lot of it's shorthand to remind me a lot of it looks like a broken-down report that you would send to some company somewhere it's a structure of information for myself it's very loose because i don't want to feel like i'm reading a page too often there are certain scenes i want to set properly and i'll write those in advance and go back and forth but for the most part i'll outline basic notes and points the npcs would know and then based on what you guys do-- every now and then if it's a very key character moment and the story lends itself and there's a good possibility that someone will ask about it there's many things that don't get asked that the npcs never mention maybe that'll come to light down the line for more important npcs or very specific story beats i will write out lines of dialogue to make sure that i don't miss any important information and to make sure that i don't end up leading the players astray accidentally because when you're improvising off the cuff sometimes stuff comes out and you're like oh shit what'd i just say that's the other thing too whenever i create an npc i'll note a texture and timbre of their voice i'll put gravelly low-key haughty and full of himself cornwall make note of the texture and dialect i use if any that way i can get something ballpark of what they were before it's not going to be perfect and i'm sure if you line them up you'd be like oh it's changed over time victor i didn't have to victor was created on the spot yeah and since then i had to write down fucking crazy old guy prospector i think is where it came from very much that (victor voice) crazy old prospector type thing that realm she's eastern european no actually this group vox machina was its first time coming together in this world i created it's been created over time with the campaign i didn't go out to build the setting to build the whole world it was a one-shot and i built a town i built stillben then as we turned from a one-shot into a campaign i began expanding and now it's become much bigger than i anticipated and i'm perpetually fleshing it out over time but yeah there was no failed earlier attempt per se very first game he had a character and he couldn't make it for the next few games it was a dragonborn paladin and then he couldn't make the next few games and when he was able to his schedule opened up for the next one i was like do you want to play the same character he was like i want to try something different and then percy was born that was where you guys found him over in the umber hills paladin yeah i will say there aren't any dead story threads from pre-stream it's hard to equate what that would be the party went where they went there are many different facets of the world that they didn't come across i'm sure there are things that might answer your question that i can't recall that got weird this is an interesting question from sanderf90 on reddit which npc that vox machina encountered became a lot more important than you first expected we know clarota wasn't supposed to join the party and victor came out of thin air are there any examples where a character you didn't expect became far more important gilmore your gilmore was phenomenal ryan's gilmore was awesome he was a merchant in emon that i had created that had a fun personality and i fleshed out his background a little bit and i thought it would be a fun character that they would occasionally come across but after that first encounter it turned into a full discussion he and vax began to build this relationship and you guys kept going back to him as your go-to purveyor of magical goods in emon then the investment became more attached and then as it progressed he became a central npc which i'm really happy about i love gilmore he's such a great character yeah there's plenty of background for gilmore since he became a central character i've fully fleshed out his backstory we'll have to see if it comes to light there is something to be said about-- as actors you're handed roles and you work as a collaboration with a production team to tell a story and all of you craft it together you're a facet of the machine there's something about creating from scratch a character's personality strengths weaknesses and then stepping into their shoes and developing them and seeing whatever their potential is for good or evil and seeing it through in that imagination-based body of theirs that is so much more personal and connected that any role i've played a lot of npcs in this game are closer to me than any character i've played in a video game which plays into a great question someone else asked in the chat room i can't remember who it was unfortunately but they asked for will and mary how did you guys come up with your character backstories it's really cool until your character dies a horrible death and you're like i'm going to take a walk on the topic of backstories and tragic backstories i will say there is no more dangerous occupation in any fantasy world than being a parent because everyone's an orphan (laughter) just me and the dm no npcs i saw a question in chat someone asked if the loss of the magic carpet was intentional and making it difficult to enchant it was not intentional it was a particular danger in the room to any of the players it was unfortunate that rolls-- the carpet took the brunt of it no i did not do it on purpose it made it so much easier for you guys to get from place to place when you had that magic carpet it was cool it had a lot of utility these things happen let's see for the cast what predictions about where the story was going did you make that turned out to be completely wrong or did you have any theories that turned out to be spot-on there was i didn't expect them to ever encounter it for the next four or five sessions let alone have it go so positively it was going to be an encounter but they managed to roll socially in a way that convinced clarota not that they were friends necessarily but to the betterment of his survival to infiltrate and manipulate she's done it twice this is a good question because this comes up often will cooper @willmortis asks @matthewmercer how open are you to ideas and suggestions from us about allies for vox machina to encounter i'm careful because it is my game world i have a very specific layout as to how the things in the story ought to go if i do intend to possibly in the future put this content out for you guys to utilize i have to be careful with copyright stuff and not using too many outside ideas because then it gets a little tricky plus a lot of people that have submitted stuff have been like hey i have an item i'd like for someone to use it does plus six damage and gives them the strength of four gods okay that's cool yo or i'll get npcs that have a 14-page backstory that is fun to read but the focus is on the players i'll try to bring in what i can so instead we've done a couple of circumstances where we've incorporated npcs that fans have submitted as part of a contest and we'll start hopefully doing that more as the year progresses there will be opportunities for that and you're more than welcome to send stuff in i don't have time to read everything unfortunately my free time is gone forever now and i accept that but we'll have contests and stuff and incorporate stuff for fans we've had fans that we've lost due to illness or circumstances in the past that i've incorporated into the game we've had fans who were sick and we've brought into the game as npcs as well and we've had contests in the past and hopefully do more of those in the future as far as how open to it i'm careful because it is still my game and i don't want it to be too much of a door i open where everyone throws everything and i no longer have control over it and i have very specific balancing ideas too but there will be opportunities yeah if i ever intend to try and release anything in the future like a campaign setting which i would love to the question comes up often i have to be very careful about that that's the largest reason there will be opportunities in the future (shushes whip crack) that's an eight preciously insane on reddit asks whether matt has ever had to discard any cool ideas because of the players going in an entirely different direction or because he felt it wouldn't fit in the world often but i hold onto them because that could come into a one-shot in the future or if it comes back around in the story they return to the same place they continue that thread possibly and like i said if i ever end up wanting to release a setting it would be a cool thing to put into the world that even if vox machina never encounters you guys can in your own games so yeah i hold onto it all not everything gets caught it's part of the fun of the randomness of the game is you never know where the players are going to go i'll put a lot of effort into maps and threads and be like all right cool so today they're-- where are you going it still happens here often but that's fine to be fair taliesin is the master of the one-liner bookend he throws out some of the best-- he'll wait for the perfect moment and then i'm sorry (boof) what you guys were saying about the creature stuff don't forget in-game you can research creatures that you know you may encounter out in the world to learn about what they do and you can depending on how well you research and retain the information learn things like weaknesses or what type of abilities they have you have a problem with that for instance in the game laura has a very strong knowledge of dragons that's been her favored enemy for a long time you guys could spend time and really delve into what threats they pose beyond your encounters and who knows what you might find any other questions burning right now i wasn't expecting you guys to retrieve craven edge from the corpse i wasn't expecting it to be kept and i definitely wasn't expecting it to be handed to you and now i'm so excited to see where this goes interesting question from duetempte in reddit says how do you balance combat around six to eight pcs especially one- or two-enemy boss fights best fast answer as i can when you have that many players you have to keep running quickly taking initiative is a huge thing for initiative when i ask from top to bottom in chunks of five 25 to 20 20 to 15 and what i do is write the players' names down in the order and then if an enemy falls into that order i'll write it in the column to the right of it staggered it almost looks like a back-and-forth line so i can tell one column are heroes one column are enemies and i have them in the order that they show up in initiative that way it's very easy very quick to write down and visually it's easy for me to reference who's up next but for balancing you don't always want to give something more hit points because that means it's going to take longer with a lot of players you still want it to be around long enough to be a challenge i recommend increasing damage it deals because it doesn't mean you have to have as long an encounter but still have that threat of serious danger not crazy damage but scale the damage it deals a lot of creatures have legendary resistance and legendary actions which are very helpful oh my god you're seven players that's fair so sorry maybe don't start off with all your powerful shit no you can barter with an npc you can't barter with the dm you deserved that a two-part question i want to answer a couple of these pseudox1 on reddit writes with some enemies that vox machina has faced every once in awhile a pc gets one-shot by something do you plan on one-shotting someone when they come up against these enemies to provide a challenge or is it a side effect of the monster all the ones they've come across have been actual side effects of the monster like the banshee that's what they do it's a nice way to bring in challenge especially when you have certain players that are really resilient every now and then it's nice to remind them that not all attacks just do damage some of them snuff you out it's a cool dynamic to it because it immediately turns the tide of the battle to not only intense danger even if it's not a very powerful creature to survival as well as being on the aggressive which is great it adds tension to it other part of the question when listening to players monologuing with each other you look like you're staring into their souls what is usually going on in your mind during those i'm remembering nick at night reruns usually dick van dyke show someone please edit that and at one of those moments when the players are monologuing my brain going off on the gilligan's island intro i was afraid it was going to be boring i didn't realize i was going to be telling you guys the whole-- and that was the condensed version you guys never got to the point where you inquired about the creation myth of exandria and what the second spark was the penance and all these other terms you've come across at points in the game it all plays into that world and that might be unveiled more as time goes on as now you're looking for the vestiges which do tie into previous time periods but yeah as soon as you guys started inquiring about it i was like okay that's a great question it was very difficult i'd spent a lot of time developing and fleshing out this entire city and i'd set the stage for it a long time ago i didn't quite know the form it was going to take i just knew that the chroma conclave depending on events that transpired and the return which was going to coincide with-- i know i had a two-year window of winter's crest festivals i was keeping tabs on that that was when they were going to be signifying the release of thordak from the fire elemental plane it just so happened that emon became so central to the campaign at that time and based on his previous experience being sealed by the adventuring party that now largely incorporates themselves with the council of tal'dorei that would be the first place to strike and it's not just emon they're hitting a lot of other targets of major power that have some history with members of the conclave and it was a tough decision but it made sense driving forward for the story it brought together a moment where players themselves their characters were starting to wonder what their purpose was it was a really great crux moment unintentionally i had this whole story arc looming and the characters were hitting interesting points of having an existential crisis of what is it that's holding us together what is our purpose and i was like oh my god this is going to be perfect this is going to be perfect boom and dropped it it was so good that whole conversation i'm sitting there going just give me 30 minutes just give me 30 minutes man it's coming it was so great it was very hard but as a writer sometimes to really elevate the stakes of a story which is what you want to do when it continues like that you want to elevate the stakes and bring everything back to a core central focus and make everyone feel the gravity of what's to come you have to destroy something that you love and emon happened to be the gem of that time you've got to mix things up a little i was glad to bring that two-year seed to bear it was fun what was your favorite pc that you've played as pc like when i've actually played a game actually my friend jason bender who's a game designer he ran a game years ago where i played a dwarf fighter my first time playing a combat character in a d&d game i was always casters before that i played a dwarf fighter named grimthorne which i actually incorporated into exandria as the dwarf that ran you guys through the brawlers' league that character is my old pc grimthorne he was a fun brash character yeah shaved dwarf with no hair on his body and most of the dwarves shunned him for that purpose yeah he took you through the brawler's league tournament yeah where scanlan summoned a pony and you cut it in half to intimidate the other team and it worked did percy's demon get stronger with every target on the list that he killed maybe also what would have happened if he killed all five or six counting cassandra i don't know i guess we'll never find out but glad you're paying attention nothing let's see what are your favorite snacks or drinks that you like to be gifted at conventions yeah we had a few great weapons gifted to us at this recent convention which were wonderful gifts and thank you guys for those and we had to go through wizard world and find a way to ship them back to us for that purpose and it was a whole-- somebody at the con gave taliesin a pepperbox replica with an actual spinning barrel a very small one but a pepperbox replica he was like this is really beautiful oh god i'm not checking luggage so he took it in two pieces and put them separately in there in the hopes it wouldn't be a problem sure enough tsa stopped him from going through he had to fill out all this paperwork spent 30 minutes this is the same tsa where the guy recognized me and sam so i walk over to check up on him and the guy goes over and goes oh of course it'd be percy and he helped actually explain to tsa what it was and that he's not trying to hide a gun through we actually had a critter as part of tsa that was helping taliesin not get arrested for trying to carry a 150-year-old firearm i will happily run an improvised one-shot to not go to prison three attuned you guys have been collecting magical items for over three years now that's the thing they have a number of them and a lot of them are circumstantially helpful i try not to give out too many you only really get one major upgrade every six months or so or somewhere in that neighborhood i try to make it more special so when you do find one it's a cool thing if you give out too many too quickly few have the impact and it's not really awesome when you find something new vex was the last person to have it that was so beautiful that worked out perfectly someone's asking tophlitz on reddit asks if i was part of the black rock city cuddle puddle burning man yes i was good to hear from you that's really cool it's a burning man gathering event it's really cool no that's the billion bunny march this is a bunch of strangers all getting together and cuddling and hanging out and telling stories i'll rewatch beats of previous episodes as i'm preparing for the next one to make sure i remember all the details of how it ended and try to pick up from there try doesn't always work but i try and to remember npc voices it's a spell that druids have creatures that have certain low-level intelligence you give them human intelligence and the ability to speak and converse they essentially become npcs trinket has an intelligence of four smarter than the average bear (groaning) and yet it is 100 percent accurate travis and i cannot implore you guys enough to really embrace low stats as a character it's such a wonderful distinguishing trait for your roleplaying capability i'm disappointed when a player doesn't roll anything lower than a ten i'm like oh man what a missed opportunity i absolutely adore as a player and as a dm rolling at least one or two low stats because it really exemplifies all sorts of crazy shenanigans you're going to get into in the future which also i want to point out is another great example both you and keyleth are great examples of characters that have low charisma a lot of people equate charisma to physicality and appearance and beauty and that is one way to do it for some people they look like the kind of person you would listen to or follow very politician-like they have this spirit to them and this visual perspective you guys are relatively attractive characters but personality-wise-- not you your d&d characters will and exactly but a perfect example kashaw has such an abrasive personality that even the most average individual is more likeable in general despite your appearance than kashaw is you rub everyone the wrong way and that's the perfect way to play a nine-charisma character someone asked here matt have you ever considered dwarves with not-scottish accents yeah i love the scottish brogue it's my favorite dialect of all and so i revel in the chance to utilize it and i've grown up around fantasy tropes of the scottish dwarf the kraghammer dwarves are definitively mostly scottish they have some variations in there there's some west country there's some that fall out a bit dwarves in other regions would probably have different dialects so if ever you guys travel to other regions and meet other regional dwarves perhaps there will be variations let's see if they have any other ones we've got time for another ten minutes of questions before we'll take a short break and we'll come back for our battle free-for-all oh that's a good question i'm foreseeing currently the campaign has probably another good year little over a year before everyone were to reach max level i don't know if we'll get that far there is a definitive arc to the story and it will progress to the point where the heroic deeds of vox machina-- hopefully whoever survives to that point-- will be battling deities and not just worlds but also realm-saving circumstances at which point there will come a moment where the story comes to completion whether it be through the fall of vox machina and the next wave of heroes that rise up to try and take that place or they will complete their goal become the heroes of the land and fade into the sunset to pursue whatever their epilogue-based storyline is which you guys would help to write in which case i would like to start a new campaign with the new level-one characters you guys would create probably in the same world after the events of the first campaign there would be elements of the universe that you've affected with your choices i've had a campaign that went close but not quite meaning we stopped playing because adults get busy and lives scatter the ravenloft campaign ended at 15 and the previous campaign ended around 15 as well tiamatzx asks question for mary what are your thoughts on the friendship between vex and zahra quick question to answer here since i get questions about house rules a lot why did you choose to make inspiration-- the normal one not a bardic one-- a d6 instead of the default advantage that was partially because there are a lot of abilities and situations that give you advantage already in the game i felt it would be a tweak where you could in theory combine the two i like the disadvantage and advantage system a lot i think it's one of the best things they did in 5th edition to streamline combat and get rid of a lot of the floating modifiers that i felt bogged down combat in other systems i felt like this was a way to incorporate it where those that could still get advantage and consistently get advantage based on how they play would still be able to benefit from the inspiration die mind you because there's a bard in the party and such a good bard i don't feel that i have to throw it out there too often you guys are pretty self-sufficient in giving your own inspiration this little kid let's see we've got time for a few more questions and then we're going to take a break and come back for the free-for-all yes you do interesting question matt have you ever gotten a tpk or killed most of the players in the party yes actually in the last campaign i ran the players went into the shadowfell and in this particular world necromancy had been banned and outlawed for a hundred years so undead and the whole idea of undead creatures largely was folklore no one saw them people thought they were old wives' tales to keep kids in from outside and so when they actually went to the shadowfell they were unprepared wandered into a tomb and were surrounded by ghouls and as opposed to focused targeting down they decided each of us take one and kill them off well then three of the five were immediately paralyzed and were torn down and two of the remaining party members one of them started screaming while the other grabbed her and pulled her out as they watched the three other party members be devoured by the ghouls that were there in that circumstance they lost three party members in one battle that were eaten they watched them be eaten in front of them what i do is in that time period i would get with the players that lost characters-- because you're there i would see if the remaining party members had options in which to attempt resurrection at their disposal see if that was successful or not preferably before the end of that session if any of those were not successful and the players were lost permanently then over the next week i would meet with the players that lost characters to have them create new ones probably a level lower than the lowest member of the party-- and meet up with them and find a way to incorporate them in the story where they would then become a member of vox machina going forward it's what i've done before in the past there is a detriment to losing your character i do bring you in a level lower not starting at level one because that would be stupid exactly that's how i would do it that's how i will do it (groaning) i don't know marisha and one of the members is up in seattle now and another member only occasionally comes on for another game maybe it was fun definitely a unique experience doing that if we have another extra life-type stream like we did because that was very successful and we had a good time with it as much as it was a gamut for me to run with you guys helping with the story-- deck of many things-- if it happens again i would love to have them all back so we'll see if we can get them and schedule them for it i hope so what color dragons would you be let's say in real life i can't answer a character question all of them no yeah i'm going to make you play that if we ever do a one-shot (laughter) there you go i was very open tailor it to the rules so for you your whole moon deity worked well for the great old one pact because it was an entity that is outside of the pantheon and you don't truly understand the nature of where it comes from just from the sky it was a perfect tie-in to that and with you i didn't want to define anything and i said you can choose from the existing pantheon of the world and i laid those out for you and i said you can create your own deity but understand that based on the current rules that it would probably be a much more confined belief system a god that doesn't have the same following of the others thus why it's a receded worship than other gods it worked out perfectly good question i will say too i've played with many players that have created characters that are across sex male players who made female characters and vice versa you see me play female characters all the time it's not a defining facet of the character yeah exactly it can guide elements to it down the road but you want to create an interesting character who just happens to be male or female i know some people have some weirdness or they're not comfortable trying to play someone of the opposite sex and that's totally fine but you'd be surprised how cool it is sometimes to jump into the character that's so different from what you're used to and see how one it can be a very freeing experience from a role-playing standpoint and you might learn a lot about yourself one more question this one's come up quite a few times from different people someone's asking about balancing encounters for creatures that could easily take down one member of the party but would also be difficult to fight for another-- that would be a good challenge for one member but would completely annihilate another person in the party how to handle that how does the party handle that that's a great point of tension in the battle if a player knows that they're squishy their tactics should revolve around learning how to stay away from that creature that could probably take them down very quickly and it's the tougher members of the party's responsibility to try and get between them as much as possible so yeah you want to incorporate aspects of a battle that will be a challenge across the party but you also want to make sure that you don't tailor every enemy specifically to a player all the time like this guy's a barbarian he has a lot of good resistance so i'll build a creature only for him and then go for this character find a good challenge for the overall party and let them figure out the mechanics sometimes they'll run really well and combo their abilities together like a well-oiled machine and they'll completely annihilate the encounter sometimes they'll do the entirely wrong tactic that they should and end up walking away limping going that was bad that was very bad sometimes it will go really poorly and they have to run that's the good thing too i always scale on the level of making the encounter difficult as opposed to too easy if you've done a few encounters that the party has steamrolled because if it gets too hard you can insinuate you don't have to stick around they could always come back later with a better plan if the first plan failed in fact some fun battles are the vengeance ones where things didn't go so great the first time but going back with the knowledge you have now you set up an ambush or find a way to use the terrain to your advantage next time it depends on the creature or monster that they're fighting if it's a beast-- if it's a creature that is driven by instinct and isn't super intelligent it will go after whatever is either the easiest and nearest kill or the thing that apparently right now poses the biggest threat to it i try to think of the creature's mindset of who it would go after so if the battle begins and all of a sudden the healer does something really crazy and flashy and hurts the enemy it might be going after the healer for a while if it's a really intelligent creature especially if it's a well-trained combat veteran that knows the strengths and weaknesses of different classes once a few rounds of combat have shown who specializes in what he may tell his team or whoever he's commanding to focus down the healer or the support class that's changing the tide of the battle if they know the barbarian's going to resist the most damage they'll ignore him for now take out the things that are supporting him and keeping him up and then we'll worry about him later it's based on the intelligence of what they're fighting and i think for me that's a lot of fun sometimes it doesn't work out sometimes the party comes up with a really cool plan and my really awesome interesting battle gets steamrolled but you know what the players earned that victory i'm not going to fight and change numbers behind the screen just because i wanted it to be cooler they earned that victory i'll give it to them all right guys it is 900 we're going to take a short bathroom break and then we're going to come back here and see which one of these fools is going to be the final standing fighter welcome back everyone so we're going to see how this works out thank you marisha so for the purposes of this everyone's going to be level 13 so bringing both kashaw and zahra up one level i need you guys to both roll additional hit points right now which we'll add to your character at the moment so d6 for you for you it'd be a d8 i'm pretty sure four plus your constitution modifier which is two so yeah that's 83 what'd you roll you rolled a five plus what's your constitution modifier plus three so eight so add eight to your total hit points for the purposes of this battle oh wait warlocks may be a d8 let me go check this again i'm used to the sorcerer stuff let me see here real fast yeah a d8 i'm sorry reroll it i'm not used to you warlocks well i'll let you keep the minimum we'll let you keep the four it's my fault all righty so since your proficiency bonuses have also gone up don't forget that your spell attack your spell dc and your physical attacks all go up by one for this battle 18 correct this is my first time using dwarven forge sets which i've always wanted to i was a kickstarter supporter when they first did the dungeon tiles i was stupid and didn't get them pre-painted never making that mistake again so i've dry-brushed all of these with white to make them look decent i hope to use more dwarven forge stuff in the future for our game because it makes for some really cool dynamic-looking sets so just so you guys are aware for this battle this open pit here in the center is an open pit it falls into darkness you don't know what's below there yeah this is an open pit you'll have to go and make a perception check next to it so you can see could be you and zahra both get access to a single 7th-level spell casting also you have access to all the equipment you have on you except for healing potions each of you only has one superior healing potion 8d4 plus eight i would prefer for you to i mean you have a couple prepared but you have to choose which one you use in combat you get advantage on your saving throws yes all righty guys all right folks i would like all of you to roll initiative for the sake of this guys because i forgot my bag of side minis which is really stupid of me the part of kashaw will be played by this rather buxom dwarf cleric the part of zahra will be played by this red-coated percy so you guys can keep track on that all right you know you have advantage on initiative as all of you are suddenly and instantaneously transported by some omniscient entity you find your feet slamming into the stone ground of what appears to be some pit a hundred feet recessed into the floor of some indeterminate location the walls and the floor are built of ancient stone you see each of you placed behind a wall with just enough visual across the top to see that the other of your band are there across from you in the center lies a darkened pit to some unknown distance of depth looking up into the sky you can see the blue sky clouds drifting above but too high to reach you hear a voice rumble up from around you going now show me who is your champion so initiative 25 to 20 anyone 20 to 15 (giggling) 15 to ten 16 all right so kash is up first five to ten 14 grog and zahra who has the higher dexterity between the two of you all right i'll say grog is going slightly faster than zahra all right based on that kash you're up first what do you want to do you're right over here okay you can grab your mini well your speed is i believe 30 so you can move six square spaces whatever you want to do buddy okay so go ahead and make a perception check yep d20 and add your perception skill okay so roll again okay so you look down what little bit of light is making it down you can see vaguely the bottom of the pit about 15 feet down ten to 15 feet so it's not a huge drop you do see there is texture to it meaning it's not a flat surface there is something down there that probably at least it doesn't look like it would happily accept your body plummeting into it all right is there anything else you want to do for your turn okay call lightning at 5th level okay you guys all of a sudden feel the hair on your body and your beard drift up almost like gravity suddenly has no impact on the moment as the smell of crispy ozone hits the air above you you can see clouds gather out of what was once a blue sky you hear in the distance the rumble of thunder yes you can all right yeah 5d10 points of lightning damage i need you to make a dexterity saving throw plus your dexterity all right i'm going to say that's a fail so you take full damage from keyleth at this point that's a terrible roll you're lucky 18 you take 18 points of lightning damage as a bolt of energy slams out of the sky like an elemental hammer hitting you and causing you to hold yourself against the wall directly to the back okay so a giant eagle or just an eagle all right since i don't have your polymorph figures with me-- [no audio until 21740] (matt scatting) whenever you want to use it but now they can hear us okay for those who were paying attention keyleth after casting her 5th-level call lightning turned into a giant eagle and then flew 80 feet up into the pit yeah you can this is getting interesting well in the meantime we shall see if we can get this to work rip sound oh no that's a good question oh a creature anybody's a creature any entity is a creature whether it be a monster or a person can they still hear us and see the top down okay well then never mind let's get this running we'll stick with this all right that ends keyleth's turn grog all right as a note if you are raging and you don't take damage or deal damage you lose your rage or not rage if you're not going to do anything okay good to know yeah if you fail to hit something or get hit which happens very rarely for you anyway the rage drops something to remember all righty so if that's ending your turn zahra you're up you see the eagle of keyleth take up after calling a bolt down from the heavens all right so the invocation goes on that are you casting that first meaning the eldritch invocation just happens on top of the eldritch blast did you have another spell or bonus ability you wanted to do beforehand or not yes but you can always move it to different targets if one falls okay good to know all right so eldritch blast firing against all three against-- all right what's the range on eldritch blast yeah she's definitely in range all right what's the ac of your eagle 13 all right go ahead and roll three d20s you do plus 12 so don't roll a one roll three times that's a hit that's a hit and third one 19 that's a hit go ahead and roll three d10s and it's plus seven to each of them there you go so 17 points of damage --13 so 33 a total of 33 points of damage did you drop form now okay first off make a concentration check for each one of those hits it's a constitution save 14 roll again so you have to beat ten on each one eight so as you're hit with the first agonizing blast it slams into your form and you keep yourself in the air the second one hits you again this time the clouds disperse as your concentration is wrecked from the blast the third one finally hits you losing your form you transform back into a druid and immediately plummet 80 feet to the ground so that's 8d6 falling damage off- we're back all right hold on you take 28 points of fall damage as you fall down into the pit smack slamming into the stone ground your bell is rung for a moment as your eyes have a hard time focusing around you you can feel the blood beginning to pour down the side of your head from the impact of slamming into the stonework all right zahra anything else you want to do with your turn stay there kash you're up i'd say actually keyleth you are prone on the ground because you fell that height yeah you can see her barely around the side okay certainly 4th-level guardian of faith so any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within ten feet of the guardian for the first time on your turn has to succeed or take damage all right so you choose an unoccupied space within range and it occupies that space so where do you want it to remain yeah if you wanted to okay i'm going to go ahead and use this piece of popcorn here as the guardian keyleth you're up uses half your movement okay the clouds re-form ah barely all right i need you to make another dexterity saving throw plus your save which would be more yeah you still failed so 4d10 lightning damage to kashaw that's better 29 points of lightning damage as another bolt streaks down slamming into the ground all right keyleth that's keyleth's turn grog you're up that's your bonus action okay this blur of grey and black comes streaking around the corner as you see the foam frothing from grog's mouth running toward you craven edge out of its scabbard hits 14 misses 21 points of slashing damage 18 points of slashing damage two of them 40 all right so roll two constitution saving throws succeeds with both 18 and 16 you hear the voice creeping in your face go come on take her life give me her strength ancient spirits of evil all right so that ends your turn grog zahra you're up where are you going you can see her there she does now hold on hold on okay constitution saving throw it is a spell so you would have advantage on the roll for your armor all right plus three so you make the save you take half damage go ahead and roll 7d8 plus 30 chat room well that escalated quickly so you take 30 points of necrotic damage yep 60 and half that so you take 30 and you're still up at ten hit points as a beam of greenish necrotic death streaks across this battlefield slamming into your side unexpectedly from behind as you're staring up at the horrible form of grog raging in front of you you feel most of your vitality sucked out of your body immediately you glance over your shoulder and see zahra around the corner going-- all right kash you're up unless you wanted to move still it's a window just so you're aware that didn't use a spell slot no because it's part of the mystic arcanum ability you get to use that once without spending a spell slot keyleth you could yes but she would have three-quarters cover if it has a spell attack roll she would get a bonus to armor class okay it's a ten-foot radius so you're getting this area so i need both of you guys grog and keyleth to make a dexterity saving throw yes you have advantage because spells 20 that would do it so you take half damage from this i believe your dc is 18 so no flame strike so roll 8d6 because it's half fire and half radiant damage it helps give you a better armor class but it doesn't help you against radial spells 30 you roll two more so there's an incredible roll 39 so 18 points of damage you take 39 points of fire keyleth is now currently unconscious right there no you keep making death saves until hopefully you'd roll a 20 and maybe stabilize well if you roll a 20 you fuck i have to remember the roll you come back to consciousness with one hit point keyleth i need you to go ahead and roll a death save all right so that's one failed save go ahead and mark that off grog it's your turn oh not really i mean depends on what you want to do if you're trying to ricochet keyleth's body-- yeah you'd probably have to hit one or the other you're going to hit keyleth on the ground yeah you can separate your moves and your attacks you can hit then move then hit okay because it's a melee attack within five feet it's an auto-crit which is an immediate two death saves how do you want to do this (yelling) and with that you hear an attempt at breath and a slight gurgle as your eyes are closed as you draw the blade you hear a satisfying yes delicious two more grog well you have your bonus action attack anyway because you have your frenzied rage so you still have your movement and two more attacks all right not great weapon master though both hit you only get two attacks on her yeah because you killed keyleth with one so 18 points of slashing damage so 38 points of slashing damage against you zahra i need you to make two constitution saving throws yeah man you guys' best bet was probably to gang up on grog and you guys let him stick around this is going to be rough roll a d20 twice adding three each roll so that's a fail second one again success so your strength goes down to ten as craven edge saps a strength point from you you get a plus one to your strength which brings you up to 18 i believe so currently you get a plus one to hit and damage on all your attacks i believe that's the end of grog's turn because you can't do much else zahra you're up don't forget as a reaction before your turn ends if you wanted to use your hellish rebuke it's either that or have him cleave your face off next turn make a dexterity saving throw he succeeds so he takes half the damage roll 2d10 so he takes seven points of fire damage to grog what are you at right now grog he's at 134 hit points guys seriously grog has rolled some of the best hit point rolls i've ever seen in my life and then he took the toughness feat and has a constitution of 20 it's stupid it's one of those things where if it's a concentration spell and you're not using it to concentrate generally just a one-off thing i'll allow you to concentrate on two things at once if you use it as a one-off spell so i would say if you wanted to hex somebody and then do a witch bolt but not have the concentration effect i'd allow that what that means is as long as you're not maintaining witch bolt i'll let it not override hex because you're just doing it as a one-off spell then hex would not overlap with it it is also a ranged spell attack which means you have disadvantage to hit him with it because he is right in your face you can step away from him to try to do it same thing disadvantage on blasts because he's right up in your face you'd have to get away from him to do that mary all right i'm going to use my cloak of the bat and fly away from him but he gets to whack me then doesn't he all right wait let me is that considered an action all it does is give you flying so you don't turn into a bat form it means you can just fly so you can do that let me pull up the book real fast you can choose to fly 40 feet it's not an actual action to use it so you can do that that'd be your movement are you going to cast that first and then go okay so grog you get a swipe at her yes though technically he does have reckless attack on him so you could attack him without disadvantage i forgot about that so if you wanted to hit him with a spell your disadvantage is canceled out by the advantage you'd have on him because he used reckless attack so it's a regular roll if you wanted to stay where you are yeah but he won't get a bonus attack of cleaving up to you if you want to take the hit to the face and run away all right make an attack grog that hits roll damage where do you want to fly 21 points of damage to you this'll be the markers for the area this whole area is filled with dark tentacles it's difficult terrain which means every five feet step you take it costs ten feet of your movement yep that's your action if you wanted to use your bonus action to drink a healing potion go ahead and do that you heal 8d4 plus eight that's right yeah so that's 14 roll two more 19 plus eight so you heal 27 hit points that's the end of your turn kash you're up these black tentacles that is eight plus three that is a failure you lose another strength point if you have luck yeah yeah never mind it doesn't happen that you know of unless he makes his save at the start of your turn you have roll to see if you're restrained and take damage are you using it on both of them that's true it might knock her concentration and lose the tentacle spell the point is i guess from a technical standpoint if you just hit him the tentacles will stay up if you hit both of them it'll probably knock her down but you lose the tentacles and he'll be able to come after you next turn it's up to you you can go after them both and take her out right now probably your call whatever you want to do she looks hurt as you're currently dealing with all these dark arcane tentacles that are sprouting out of all the stones around the ground a beam of light seems to descend from the sky for a second as it turns to a dark red crimson and bursts around you in a giant inferno of searing divine energy it curves around and incinerates the remains of keyleth go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw so you take half damage from that go ahead and roll 7d10 fire damage that's what she did to take out the wyverns 43 points of fire damage you take half of that so 21 points of fire damage keyleth smolders grog it's your turn go ahead and make your dexterity saving throw 14 is a failure you take 3d6 points of damage could you roll that zahra this is bludgeoning so you take half the damage so he took four points of bludgeoning damage and you are restrained currently restrained to specifically read you what it does your speed becomes zero so you cannot move attack rolls against you have advantage and your attack rolls have disadvantage you now have disadvantage on dexterity saving throws so grog what are you doing okay let me see the card you don't have to roll for it it's each creature in the line it turns as you see grog the tentacles turn around and throw something toward you all of a sudden it sparks with electrical energy and streaks toward you like a bolt of lightning horizontally i need you to make a dexterity saving throw zahra that's a success so you take half damage roll 4d6 lightning damage grog so you take four points of lightning damage as the javelin streaks past you and skids across the stonework behind sending a few sparks and then falls to the ground its energy used all right ends your turn grog zahra you're up no you used evard's black tentacles well let me see agonizing blast isn't a cantrip it's an eldritch invocation which gives you the benefit on top of your eldritch blast so yeah you can do that three times that's your cantrip and you can do that yeah so all three against him or do you try and aim for your buddy over there let me see the javelin what it does yeah i don't know what you guys are talking about you guys are really weird oh and because it is four damage go ahead and roll a constitution save to maintain concentration on your tentacles ten's enough to keep it so the tentacles stay thank you for the reminder guys so you're doing all three against grog all right roll with advantage on each roll because of his reckless attack go ahead and roll that twice a nine roll again all right so that what's your ac 19 it does hit you because you have plus 12 on that attack roll so roll for the second one that's one hit and roll again that hits again roll for the third one roll again see if it gets a crit two hits and a crit all right so let's go ahead and roll that so that's one plus seven so that's eight points of damage no it's force damage that's to hit not damage plus seven that so that's eight points of damage second one five plus seven is 12 points and then this is the crit so that's eight plus seven is 15 from the last one you can totally okay so the last critical hit does nothing so as you hit him with the final hit it slams into him and he puts his chest out pumps it takes the blast and it seems to disperse across his muscled form to no effect all right so against who all right make a dexterity saving throw with disadvantage because you are restrained 16 not enough that's a failed save do 8d6 damage against grog as you're being held back by the tentacles all of a sudden you see another streak of divine energy come from the ground as flames erupt from beneath you your vision becomes nothing but fire so 26 points of fire damage it's a bonus action in my games so don't worry too much about that don't forget you have your danger sensibility roll another dexterity saving throw to be safe it's things you can see like spells and traps nah sure 8d4 plus eight so you're up next grog know what you're going to do shitty rolls all right grog i want you to go ahead and roll a constitution save real fast 11 as the flames subside you take a moment to take in the damage you've taken there's a familiar smell a smell you've smelled once before when trinket ran across a series of lightning traps the smell of burnt hair as you reach up you find your chin clean (yelling) grog you're up yeah top of the turn i need you to try and break free you are restrained currently let me double check really fast to make sure we have the specifics here we haven't used this spell before okay so you take another 3d6 bludgeoning damage because you started your turn restrained in the tentacles so do another 3d6 so you take five points of bludgeoning damage round it down you have to use an action to make a check to try and break free of it all right go ahead and make a strength or dexterity check your choice all right not a saving throw a check that's still enough you break free of the tentacles break free using your action you still have your bonus action and your move though you can't move quite as far which way are you going you've got two targets right now all right (counting) you can just get up to her with your barbarian speed you have your bonus action still you can attack with your bonus action you have frenzied rage remember up to you all right go for it is this a reckless attack 26 hits go ahead and roll damage 21 points of damage to you zahra and a constitution save i need you to make a concentration check so roll another constitution save oh that's a failure the tentacles vanish from the scenery as the spell disappears bye kernels i need you to make another one from craven edge that is another failure you lose another strength point you're now a strength of nine and you gain another plus one grog well plus one to your strength what is your strength at now so no bonus yet next time all right that ends grog's turn zahra you're up no it's from the staff itself okay using almost all the charges in that staff you still have to make a ranged spell attack which right now would be at disadvantage but he attacked so it would be a straight roll so go ahead and do that roll a d20 that's a nine plus your spell attack which is 12 21 what's your ac it hits that's 5d12 points of lightning damage against grog five because she did it at 5th level 41 points of damage to you grog lightning damage all of a sudden up in your face she holds her staff in her front closes her eyes and a blast of dark lightning hits you zahra is that the end of your turn you still have a bonus action that's zahra's turn kash you're up you are out of your normal vicinity yes you also know that you can cast lower spells at a higher level if you wanted to what's the range on it yeah if he fails the save you can banish him for a period of time to another plane technically it would be the same plane it's just in a different timeline if you were fighting in the hells yeah it would send you back to the prime material plane and he would sit there it takes him out of the fight for a while but it's your call what are you doing kash with a 6th level you could flame strike both of them if you have one left of that which would do more damage it's your call i was just shooting it out there all right so that's 9d6 points of damage to each of you do you want it to be radiant or fire damage more it's split into two types of damage so do you want to do more radiant or more fire damage they both hurt the same although she's resistant to fire so fire or radiant what are you going to do just say one or the other so roll 5d6 right now i need you guys to both make dexterity saving throws so you take 13 points of radiant damage that is not reduced you take 13 points of radiant damage then roll 4d6 more 13 again so you take 13 points of fire damage oh you made the save both of these are halved sorry i forgot about that you take half of it so you would be at it was 13 you'll take six points of damage all right that ends your turn okay grog it's your turn all right make your first strike with advantage her ac's 14 that hit mary and 21 points of damage zahra falls unconscious i need her to make a constitution saving throw you roll a d20 okay so she succeeds you are unconscious now on the ground bleeding out as the blood that you draw from the blade you can see seeping into the outside of craven edge grog what do you want to do she's unconscious at your feet and you see kash in the distance rushing near a wall roll with advantage twice that hits it's an automatic crit so you lose two death saving throws mark those off you don't roll damage she just lost two death saving throws she's on the edge you have one more attack this would be your bonus action to attack yeah you haven't used your potion yet right yeah you can do that it's not d6s it's d4s 8d4 plus eight this is getting intense all right so you heal that up zahra it's your turn i need you to make a death saving throw that's a success so mark a success that brings us to kash it's your turn you have an unconscious zahra over there that you could finish off or toss a distant heal if you wanted to bring her back or go directly after grog and try and bring him down no you'd have to move over here to get a clear line of sight on him really you could move that far but then you're outside of your guardian which you can do if you want so what do you want to do you can get there you can see him all right yeah you can do that okay so you create a floating spiritual weapon i will make this little kitten your spiritual weapon where do you want to put it within 60 feet all right little tiny floating death kitten so all right you have a spirit weapon a giant cat bludgeon summoned by vesh and dark energy pours off of this floating cat (cat yowl) every impact all right so go ahead and make a melee spell attack roll a d20 twice and add plus ten take the higher one and add ten that hits go ahead and roll is it a 4th level okay for every two levels so it takes 2d8 plus five damage roll that twice 16 points of force damage so it's not reduced (cat noises) you're being bludgeoned by a somewhat ethereal-looking dark energy kitten go ahead and roll again for the attack 2d20 so plus ten it still hits go ahead and roll 2d8 plus five 17 points of force damage yep this is where things get real interesting yep barbarians so you are back at one hit point that ends your turn kash grog it's your turn you know what go ahead and make a grapple check roll an athletics you can roll athletics or acrobatics which is higher your strength or your dex probably your strength so roll a d20 and add-- what's your athletics three so roll a d20 and add three what'd you roll so as you go to grab him you get your hands on kash and as you begin to try and pull all of a sudden kash's eyes go jet-black and you see this burst of dark energy around as vesh comes in to protect the one cleric follower as that happens your hands are forced off of his form you still have a bonus action no it's an action to try and grapple great weapon master or not i've helped you 21 hits go ahead and roll damage i'm double-checking i'm trying to remember if grapple is-- so 35 points of damage i'm double-checking one thing because i'm trying to remember if grapple is an action or an attack you also have an additional attack because it only takes one attack to attempt to grapple or you could attempt another grapple your call do you want to grapple with your second attack or do you want to hit him again great weapon master or not so as the first strike comes down with craven edge striking across the armor it splits and beneath you can see the red crimson already spilling inside make a constitution saving throw d20 add your constitution modifier two i believe right it's a failure so he steals one of your strength your strength goes up by one it goes down to 16 doesn't make a huge difference so the second strike comes down across with craven edge this time you put your shield up and you can feel the weight of it almost pushing you off your feet but it streaks across the armor no impact that ends grog's turn zahra make another death saving throw two failures two successes kash you're up it would replace the other one you can use your bonus action to send mittens there and do another regular attack or a spell if you wanted to your call it's a bonus action however you do need to make a concentration check for the damage you took last turn what was the total damage of that attack again total damage 35 half of 35 that brings it to we'll say 17 roll a constitution saving throw nope mittens so mittens vanished from the impact but you can cast it again if you want to hold on let me check one thing really fast spiritual weapon checking one thing here just to make sure lot of stuff happening really fast spiritual weapon is not concentration my apologies so you don't have to do that i look over and see travis going like concentration check i'm like shit right i need to stop doing that mittens can move 20 feet and repeat the attack roll 2d20 16 plus your spell attack that'll hit go ahead and roll even at a minimum grog i need you to make another constitution check with a dc of 15 now 28 still at one hit point grog takes the hit almost goes down and then comes right back up at the feet angry you can use your action now to do something else only a bonus action can do that so now you have your action you could hit with your spear or you could do another spell if you wanted to you still have your action what are you going to do you could yeah he'll get an attack on you if you run all right roll 2d20 adding ten to each hit so go ahead i'm sorry adding nine roll again yeah so you hit it the damage hits i need you to make another constitution saving throw dc of 20 buddy (chuckles) how do you want to do this (yelling) well in theory he could finish you off next round this is your dark spear the shadow spear as the shadow spear pierces the front of your unarmored chest it goes sticking out the back of your torso at that moment you can see his eyes go dark once again as the spear itself sends this cold wave through your body the necrotic enchantment on the spear sucking the life from you you watch as grog reaches out grabbing it but his muscles wither and atrophy within a matter of seconds his face going sallow his entire life force drained into the spear as you withdraw it from his body the now extremely malnourished shriveled body of grog crumples to the ground with a cracking sound of bones against stone you hear in the back of your head now a voice that says you've proven yourself worthy lift me become my new master yeah (blade spinning through air impact) i need you to roll another death saving throw two and with that you hear in the distance this small (exhale) (laughter) there was a slight chance you would have rolled a 20 and it would've been great if you woke up and went-- well done guys that was really interesting it's okay i'll remember to bring my proper minis next time so yeah the pit if anyone would have fallen in there-- you saw the texture in the bottom-- it was a cluster of undead that would grab and pull down and devour every single turn you'd have to roll to try and get out of the grasp if not you'd be restrained and be taking 3d10 points of damage every turn there are spells like that yeah which spell is this geas isn't a direct-- you don't command them to do a specific action you tell them to complete this task for you and they're compelled to do it and if they resist it they take damage the moment you send someone on a suicidal impact the spell immediately breaks possibly but you could be like hey i need you to focus your attacks on zahra then he could choose to do that or try to resist it and take the psychic damage it would've been a hard sell with a really low saving throw roll a player could have been compelled to lose a round to inspect but it wouldn't have been like yeah sure and then dove in also don't forget to check your casting times as well i don't know what the geas casting time is yeah that would not be a combat spell every round in combat is six seconds so that would have been a spell you could do outside of combat geas cool so yeah depending on if some point down the road we have the opportunity like the break after a major story arc when we run another one of these games but with the entire vox machina party which would be fun that would be a ways off but you saw this was fun to do we'll try that sometime and a great example of the power of warlocks being nasty the survivability of barbarians being ridiculous although it was you versus three magic casters which was not a good fight but even so-- and even so it came down to quite literally one roll because if that hadn't taken you out that last spear hit if you would have survived that saving throw you would have had three attacks on him next round and with great weapon master two of them would have taken him down that's amazing guys thank you so much for coming yeah seriously there will be no actual session here me and marisha will be out of town we're going to be at
