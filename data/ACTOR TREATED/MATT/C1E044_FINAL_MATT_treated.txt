hello everyone and welcome back to critical role we've had a two-week hiatus due to illness and traveling but we're back and we're a little late today because of traffic in los angeles which is always a pleasurable experience it was good times we love you steve you did great but no so we're happy to be here we missed you guys we missed each other and the rest of our team just arrived as well we've got a sam and we've got a liam coming in right now so let's go ahead and knock these announcements out so we can get this game started so first and foremost i want to let you guys know that tor books has been nice enough to help sponsor tonight's episode of content so you guys have seen announcements and stuff for their new book bands of mourning which we had at the last game you being a brandon sanderson fan for a long time so it's good good stuff i've been perpetually prodded about whether or not that's me on the cover it's not but if they ever option it for a film it is well see there we go read the books then write a screenplay then get it optioned and then cast me yeah so bands of mourning thank you tor for taking an interest in our little show and i hope you guys take an interest in their awesome books so have fun next up announcements me and marisha want to give a big shoutout and thanks to kaizoku con in ireland we had a wonderful time meeting a bunch of you critters over there on the green isle dude they were out in force it was amazing it was really really cool so thank you guys for all coming out and visiting us (laughs) because we got a lot of it when we were there let's see next up i want to give a thanks to syrinscape again i'm going to be incorporating syrinscape's audio programming into sessions in the near future once we get everything ironed out from my list setup but they're an awesome program you should check out to help you run audio for your tabletop gaming experiences it has built-in soundboards and music tracks it's really really cool so i recommend you check them out also i want to give a big thank-you to dwarven forge we had a critter in the past send me a bunch of dungeon tiles and i myself had backed previous kickstarters of theirs and just recently got all my city builder stuff and have more that they sent me that may be showing up on the stream in the near future to help make battle maps and things look a lot cooler and more three dimensional so i'm excited about that they also have a really amazing kickstarter that just went up last week called the castle builder where now dwarven forge allows you modular pieces where you can build and customize your own castle pieces for your game at home and it looks ridiculous so if that's something that interests you for your home games go check out dwarven forge's kickstarter for the castle builder looks pretty fricking rad i've already given them way too much money for it also for those of you who have tried out the order of the lycan for my blood hunter build i did an update last night minor tweaks basically just clarifying some of the rules for dex builds as well as some minor balance adjustments but go check it out beyond that all the feedback's been really positive i don't foresee any major tweaks in the near future so that's good marisha you wanted to pitch your new show that's coming out here perfect we'll have that video at the break today let's see huzzah laura you have something you just got a chance to talk about recently monster lab on kickstarter ah yes taliesin you had something you wanted to go through and liam you said you wanted to-- this is what happens when we're gone for two weeks we have to cram all of our backup like catchup announcements and little friend-bumps there at the front so waze if you're looking to throw some sponsor dollars around (morgan freeman voice) you got to make sure you get to your place on time yes yes delightful wondrous anything else any other announcements anything crazy all right let's do it guys let's step on bring it in so to catch everyone up what's going on vox machina our intrepid band of adventurers after dealing with the horrible attacks by the dragon circle known as the chroma conclave destroying cities all across tal'dorei the party escaped sent the refugees they could as well as allies back to whitestone seemingly not on the radar of this attacking front of dragons at the moment and then made their way toward vasselheim to find allies pike staying behind to help with the refugees at the moment upon going to vasselheim you managed to encounter a number of old friends from the slayer's take and enlist them for the time being to help you with the refugees and your current wanderings here in the city proper at the same time you encountered lady kima who also has agreed to help with the events in whitestone and this entire dragon attack towards the east and you after wandering the city for a bit retrieving these allies followed grog into the trial forge where you had a conversation with earthbreaker groon and by conversation i mean a full-on drag-out sandpit battle to prove your worth to him in which case you were given information about these things called the vestiges of the divergence artifacts of great legendary power that existed from previous wars that had wiped out most of society multiple times these vestiges have been scattered around the world many of them lost to the history books or passed down as symbols of power through various bloodlines or government positions or stolen and haven't been seen for hundreds of years you've found the location of two of them one of which was the titanstone knuckles and the other happened to be some sort of a leather a deathwalker's leather that belonged to a champion of the raven queen this exists in apparently the champion's tomb which used to exist to the west of vasselheim until it eventually sunk into the ground as the topography shifted over time and resides beneath a lake known as the marrowglade loch so that is where we left off as you guys recovered from the encounter in the trial forge and deciding on your plan going forward stepping from the tavern having a few drinks and discussing the merits of your current path what would you like to do friends yeah the marrowglade loch resides about a seven- to eight-hour journey swift of foot to the west-southwest area of vasselheim and it is marked on the map it's not marked as a major place it's just this sunken somewhat muddy swampish land you've passed-- no no no no that was more north but you passed this in your travels and some of your hunts with the slayers' take before but it's never been a place of consequence it is just a lake that exists on a map until this significance was given to it yeah i'd say probably some time in the past and kima at this point looks about and says well if we have plans to head east and probably not spend much time here among vasselheim for a while i have some business i've got to clear up here as well this is true actually no and she steps up to you and you you know at first view you've had you see she's square-shouldered and pretty rough in the physicality of what you'd imagine from most halflings you see she walks with her shoulders forward and she has this intensity to her step even when it's just a friendly exchange she bears armor that is gold with various silver and blue details on it that are parts of the presentation of bahamut and the temple that is a representation of his worship she carries a large metallic hammer that she keeps left over one shoulder she has just-past-her-shoulders wavy ashy dirty-blondish hair and a big scar that rides across her face as well as a number of other scars that aren't quite as visible she grins as she steps up and moves her hammer to the other side of her shoulders with a clink and puts her hand out she pulls her hand away and she goes interesting coming from you definitely all right anyway i've met few as unremarkable as you in my travels touch√© well i'll get about my business here you said you're traveling for half a day to a day say meet back at the slayer's take in about 24 36 hours then head on to the east or meet up with you i'm going by what you're telling me we can meet up whenever you'd like i'm coming with you yeah but i have some business to take care of here in the city before we go ahead and head off well you guys are going-- where she crosses her hands for a second and says why are you so interested in my business human i was trying to arrange passage to the east got a little bit of pull here in the city some favors that're owed to me i figured maybe i could do a favor but that's i don't know if you're going to have an attitude about it are we meeting back in a couple days or are we waiting what's the business here i-- i'm assuming a day i have to try and find a couple of folks and pull some strings no i'm fine i've seen plenty of your strengths in the past part of you coming and asking for the aid of the palace was to help with this whole scourge of dragons you're talking about to the east the ones that you say have destroyed most of westruun and most of my friends still exist in that area so i figure that's the passage we need to get over there eeeeast through trees that's weird make a history check it's a pretty unremarkable loch as far as lakes go it's maybe a few hundred feet across it's more from a part of the land mass actually having a large sinkhole and where certain things may have existed and there are bits of ruin throughout the surroundings of some sort of a structure that existed there but most of it seems to have been swallowed up by the ground and the lake has formed in its place though this was quite some time ago and it swells or drains based on how much snowfall there has been in recent seasons and it's been a pretty heavy winter for you guys so you imagine from the times you've seen it that it's been pretty high if not frozen over at times at this time it's probably say midafternoon (laughs) oh it's been two weeks and i missed you guys hm there are a collection of books at the take but most of them are in reference to cataloging various creatures details about their lifestyles their inherent weaknesses what elements of their bodies can be harvested and what clients are usually looking for it's more specific to the business of the slayer's take than anything that would involve local history i mean i'll say if two of you would like to make an investigation check between the two your choice whoever wants to do that we'll base see what information you can find 17 in taking the better part of the rest of the day and asking around you manage to find one location that carries books and what you would consider as sort of like a library though nothing of the ancient historical fashion there are many books about the history of the temples here in the town elements of the battles of old but they're all very vague in their writing as almost like a story as opposed to a historical fact-gathering-type presentation you manage to find a place that does deal in dusty books partially repaired and restored books a little bit pricier but there is one tome that seems to talk specifically about the history of the raven queen's rise here in the city and if you would like to possibly take this book for a price that is up to you no you guys are doing this separately essentially right now you are it's a small place but there are two employees and it's not very busy at all you're the only person in the room so they're both just quietly watching from a distance well about 30 seconds into that one of the employees comes up and goes excuse me miss-- if you are going to-- i would ask if you would wish to read this to purchase it as that is our business we are not an open place to just utilize the information it's a book sale collection please if you're going to read it please purchase the book or leave you may peruse for but a moment if you do not find an essence of what you're seeking at that time i would have to ask you to leave yes in the brief time that you have going through you manage to glean there is a chapter that speaks of the divergence it speaks of the last large struggle that happened in the center of civilization this was the second battle before the gods themselves fully rescinded from the land itself and the raven queen did have a number of chosen champions as a part of this endeavor and that's as far as you get before he goes all right so you've had a bit of time there is a tag on the book that says 30 gold he reaches out and grabs the book and says if you are not a serious collector i'm sorry then it seems that we-- and he starts pulling it tugging it up he slams the book shut as you're perusing through the pages 30 gold or i will ask you to leave make a persuasion check as far as you're concerned right now my name is no sale and pulls the book back takes the gold hands you the tome benjamin cole should you find your way around here again and wish to pay full price for another one of our fine books come again he says begrudgingly as you exit the facility so looking through the book it does talk about-- specifically there are a few champions many that were lost entirely to the battle unrecovered one of the highest of the order of the raven queen that fought in her name was named purvan-- purvan p-u-r-v-a-n oh you guys are cruising to a tpk today (laughter) no this is great (with great emphasis) purvan-- all right that's more hit points onto these guys here for later all right purvan suul is the full name though the name was given to the raven queen at the time of signing itself to the order in which they become nameless the champions are just mentioned or spoken of in public as the champion so the name is part of the gift they give to the raven queen when they swear themselves to her fell in the final conflict and was interred within a tomb to the west of vasselheim it is said that it is a multi-leveled tomb and as the raven queen's fellowship began to fall out of favor after the divergence had happened-- essentially because her realm is death during times of great conflict and strife there is great power and a lot of energy given towards the raven queen when things fall into peace time or at least for an extended period of time there isn't a lot of conflict or burgeoning death and destruction within the vicinity her worship tends to dwindle as that dwindled there wasn't enough people within the remaining bloodlines to maintain the tomb it fell into disuse and since then has not been tended to you go ahead and explain it is a fine smooth dark metal warhammer that as the handle itself leads towards the heavy head portion of the hammer the metal turns instead to almost a glistening ivory that has symbols pushed into it a language you don't understand but there's a giant moon crescent carved into each side of the hammer's head make an attack roll we'll say with disadvantage because you were taking a half-measure it's technically non-magical 14 you manage to just barely as you see this thing coming towards you and duck beneath it roll stealth roll a perception check try as you might to look around vax is nowhere to be seen too late so as you're looking around you see this strange quiver of shadow that seems to formulate in the air and this awkward still unmoving awkward mannequin-type visual recreation of vax muddles itself there i need you to roll an insight check finally vax cannot evade your vision this time grog okay with this weird awkward half-grin frozen in place the hammer streaks down through this form and passes completely through it slamming into the mud beneath splattering mud up and around you across your chest and for a brief instant vax completely seems to have evaded the attack with that the illusion is dissipated and vax is no longer there before you the harder he squeezes you you fear you may turn into mud all right at this point kima has pulled a small flask out and takes a swig and goes (sighs) ah i've missed you so are we resting or are we off i'm growing impatient travis and there are all sorts of things that you could anticipate along the way there are a number of denizens of this forest that are all sorts of levels of danger there are roving orcish bands from the far far northwest which you encountered on your way to rimefang there are a number of other creatures that wander these areas some of them bestial some with some element of culture there are bandits that come from the far west possibly from across that sea that occasionally try and kill and pillage as best they can most everyone avoids the city of vasselheim because that place is pretty hardcore by comparison so yeah all kinds of things you could find at a fast pace on foot it would take you seven to eight hours you guys have a great history of-- up to ten willing creatures for wind walk all right mary and for some of you it's a familiar if still uncomfortable physical feeling as your body-- you become this amorphous cloudy vaporous form you can fly at a very swift speed even against a relatively strong wind trinket in his mist form is seemingly very uncomfortable with this circumstance what's happening i will follow sure (laughter) i can imagine as part of the enchantment as you guys can pass wind through your mist vocal cords oh he's delightful all right so you guys begin to head westward following your previous experience at the direction that it takes you you push that way kima is also still getting used to this whole mist form endeavor it takes a little bit for you guys to adjust to this locomotion but it is very swift in comparison to moving on foot drifting over the top of the forest canopies you guys riding the top in this full-on falcor fly-through moment as you're cruising through the snow-capped forest you can see a cluster of large eagles in the distance you guys manage to swoop around eventually as the sun begins to make its way towards the horizon-- you managed to cut a good four or five hours off your journey on this making your way towards the marrowglade loch there are certain areas where the canopy itself breaks apart and you can see ravines you can see where areas of the topography have cracked or shifted in time and there are drops that go deep under the earth though you cannot quite see where they would continue to go until you make your way to the marrowglade and there you can see still full to the top if a little icy at the surface it seems relatively undisturbed you make your way all drifting down back beneath the canopy of the vesper timberland and at the edges of the lake no actually it's a pretty solid surface and as you guys have drifted down in your form looking at it you can see that there is a layer of ice you're not quite sure how thick but the surface is very crystalline make a perception check make a perception check for you as well 25 you see there are bits of stone scattered about 30 feet out from the lake's edge going to inspect them and looking about them there are pieces of fallen walls and what appear to be elements of the tomb possibly before it fell within but you do not see any sort of opening or entrance it's just a part of some structure some foundation that was left behind make an investigation check 22 nothing near the loch the largest chasm or portion of land that you saw that was broken and receded into the earth itself was probably about a half-mile to a mile back nothing that is in the immediate vicinity of this lake yes you guys have come down into the forest you're all still in mist form so you're unable to directly interact with anything in the area 11 doesn't seem to have any specific elements or markings make an investigation check sure so you guys all rest around the outskirts of this lake as high as you want to be right now everyone has come down to the edge of the lake so you're right off the ground okay (laughs) if a bear could grin it would however the process is very strange as you see this misty cloud (poof) into a bear it's about a minute for the full transformation the spell still maintains its eight-hour time period and you can transform back and forth during that eight-hour period so we'll say it's been about three to four hours so you're about half-duration all of you eventually take a minute to revert back to your physical forms and you're all now standing at the edge of the lake next four hours yep you just can't do anything while you're in that form other than move so your head goes (boosh) a little crack (cracking noise) as he says that you see a trickle of crimson streaking down the front of his head at the place where he put his head or any other place okay testing it with your foot on the edge it doesn't seem to be any give looking up close you can see it's probably a good inch and a half of ice yeah it takes you a few minutes but you manage to break apart and make a head-sized hole it's about an inch make a perception check with disadvantage you see through reality giant floating baby right outside of the planet in space all right so glancing through the murky water beneath the ice's surface it is dark and what little bit of light that would be hitting the surface is refracting through the ice so it's very hard to get a form you can see there's a very thick layer of bottom-of-the-lake undergrowth various underwater plants that have caked the entire floor area of the lake however you can just see at the edge of your vision before the rest of the light is swallowed by the water and the murkiness of the depths you can see what looks to be the edge of some sort of stone structure where two walls would be joined but they break off and crumble and disappear into more of the undergrowth sure you cast light at the end of your staff it glows and illuminates and as you shove it down the light disperses beneath the ice okay so having to close one eye separately as the light source is literally right in your face you do look past using the air trapped in the mask a little bit of water is peeking in because it's not perfect you do manage to see beyond that yes there is indeed an element it looks almost like a slightly tilted peak of some sort of structure that comes to a point and the top of the point is broken off and crumbled and there are a couple of sections of stone that seem to offshoot at four different points towards the very bottom of the lake itself i'd say it's about 50 to 60 feet deep yep it's about dusk now if you guys are landing you pull out your brand new hammer (doosh doosh) ice shards flying off splashing in the water you're covered in this ice-cold water now vex turns into a large gaseous form okay the two twins (foomf) together all right all right you guys all three of you descend into the open portion of the lake that grog has broken through you guys do it's a slog and you can move slowly but the speed that's normally granted to you by this-- you actually move slower in this form underwater than you would normally swimming and as you submerge yourselves you realize even in this form air is required and you start (straining noises) the forms-- it's almost like mist appearing on the edge of the lake that (fwoosh) forms up into your two different forms you however still delve down as your alligator and you swim your way down across the bottom of the lake all right so as you guys are setting up camp in a similar way that you did in whitestone up within the actual tree canopy itself i need you to make an investigation check as you check around the ruins looking about you can see there appears to be two different entrances that are both completely caved in what you do see though is there's an area of the bottom of the lake about ten feet away from one of the edges of the temple itself that there is no undergrowth there's the muddy floor but it appears as if there is no actual plant life that has grown in this ten-foot-circle area it's mud okay you take your snout and dig through the mud and bring up some clouds of dirt and whatever scum has congealed at the bottom of this pond it murks up the water around you your vision is obscured doesn't seem to be revealing anything per se you see what would be an entrance to the structure but the stonework itself has collapsed in on itself actually no it's pretty plain the exterior is pretty damn plain in presentation what minor bits of design or grooves that were put into the stone to give it a presentational bump have eroded over time but beyond that it seems surprisingly plain what else would you want to try and do you are welcome to do whatever you want to do while you're here all right you guys return and you relay what you found to the rest of the group as you guys are preparing yourselves at this point the sun has set and the night itself is going from red to dark purple to a proper evening sky anything else you wish to prepare for the evening before you all find yourselves resting all right anyone else yeah sure go ahead and make a nature check it wasn't mathematically perfect but it was noticeable to be a section of the lake floor that was glaring to be missing in a large patch it was very soft 18 from what you understand the reasons for something to not grow on the bottom of the lake would mean that the dirt and the surrounding earth would have to be disturbed enough to where nothing could take root from what you know and have researched about the worm you discovered previously they tend to favor more rocky mountainous terrain than underwater there are many creatures that can burrow plenty of underwater serpents there's all sorts of manner of creatures in this world serpents in lakes nothing that would be monumental beyond actual water serpents which are minor inconveniences and just natural creatures anything of this size per se-- there are all sorts of entities that it could be but none that would be specific to a lake location necessarily whether it be a subterranean creature that uses it for passage or if there's something that lives in the lake or is part of the lake living in the water itself nothing comes to mind from your experience it's past sunset it's now in proper night okay so the two of you are waiting at the edge of the loch keyleth jumps off the edge and in midair forms into this giant shark form that slams into the surface of the cold water through the opening that grog had already opened all right make an investigation check are you inspecting the ruin what do you want to do investigation check there's a difference between your knowledge of nature vs actually having to investigate a specific detail 14 if you're looking at the area that she was mentioning where the plant life is missing it doesn't appear to be man-made by any means it just looks to have formed by some perpetual disturbance of the muddy earth in that vicinity anything else you want to investigate while you're down there it has some variation to it and there's a portion that appears to have been dug up or at least there is a slight indentation okay make another investigation check about the ruins specifically 11 looking about same details that she made out about it you do see there is one other stone entrance of the partially tilted stone structure looks almost like there was a double doorway there at one side of it but a series of stones and a portion of the structure have crumbled in on it and it has blocked the passage looks like a partially collapsed or completely collapsed entrance to this structure okay the shark (boosh) out of the water catches you off for a second almost jaws-ride style there you go keyleth reverts to her normal form they varied in size because it was part of the wall that had fallen in on itself so there are sections that are three three and a half feet in diameter and there are also a number of smaller head-sized rocks and chunks that had all filled in this space a lot of the general soot and mud that had gathered as part of the lake's creation had filled in and covered elements of it and seeped in to form this pucker-point if you will why are you making it weird (laughter) all right all right he's a very big bear and the moment that you glance over and give a look without even looking at you you just hear this (growls) all right anything else you wish to prepare for the evening all right you all find yourselves asleep-- okay the whole process of getting trinket up into the tree itself is hilarious it's a group effort to a certain extent there's a difference between climbing a tree and getting up into a tree and then getting into a comfortable place where you can rest and not destroy the tree it's a combination of minor druidic talents to create an element of the tree's growth that would be able to support a weight the size of a bear yeah you've done it before all right the two of you keep watch for the first watch we'll say for about a four-hour period okay as the end of your watch progresses i need you both to make a perception check the two that were taking watch the twins looking off towards the other side of the lake you see under what little bit of moonlight is peeking through the cloud cover over the area which breaks up every now and then you can see a few stars glistening and a little of the moon peeks through catches your attention specifically as the moon is the essence of your patron through your vision you can see a handful of small-- i say small small from this distance but relatively large trinket-sized furry entities that cluster up to the edge of the lake on the opposite side not at this distance no the full distance around it i'd say 250 to 300 feet it's not a huge lake they're about 50 60 feet from you guys right now darkvision up to a certain distance i'd say best you can look at it you've encountered these in the past and this appears to be a small group of evening-wandering owlbears that are passing through the vicinity they do not appear to notice your presence and are just passing through mr owl's bad but mr turtle was a real dick because he's the one who sent the kid to it knowing full well the owl was going to eat that treat the true villain's mr turtle you get slightly nervous as the owlbears make their way closer to your edge of the lake going to where the initial breaking of the ice was set by grog they all drink of the ice-cold water and then eventually make their way scare on the opposite side of the forest a couple maybe you find two owlbear feathers okay what kits do you have with you make a dexterity check just a straight dexterity check he is asleep talking in his sleep you finish out the rest of your watch using the moonlight at your disposal you manage to make a couple of owlbear arrows with the feathers you found they're functional they'll do next watch all right you guys go to sleep the two of you stay up all right you watch and the next four hours go by unhindered at which point you hear a voice say good i'm trying to sleep (laughter) at this point you hear a distant screech that echoes across the night sky all of you wake up while not extremely loud it is very noticeable and cuts through the silence as there is a very still wind tonight you two make a perception check not yet no okay as you went to sleep you didn't as you guys are coming back to consciousness you see a shape that's just-- can't make out the actual details of it but it coasts across the distant sky across the clouds and a little bit of moonlight framing the image okay you pick it up and what you see in the distance is a very very large bird cresting across the distance it doesn't appear to be coming in your direction but it just slowly makes its way just over the opening in the canopy it's pretty damn close it disappears over the opposite side-- it does you catch it just before it disappears over the distant horizon it arcs away and then vanishes past the rest of you go back to sleep you guys are finishing up your watch did you want to-- okay so is it just kash taking this next one no you've had a full eight hours' rest as the hours pass-- (laughter) the rest of the group finds themselves to consciousness the cold morning air and frozen bits of early-morning dew across the grass and growth in the forest the hole's still there but there is a very thin layer of what appears to be forming ice that could be easily cracked there you go grog has now effectively peed in the marrowglade loch two weeks folks we've been storing this up all right so what's the plan guys it's-- the surface is near-freezing by the just general temperature of the morning air you're liable to get hypothermia if you spend any extended period of time in the water it's about 350 feet circumference around it's not a very very large-- nothing beyond the edge of the lake there isn't i mean you find bits and pieces of broken stone but nothing that seems to be indicative of a change in topography a cube of up to 100 feet on a side so you could pretty much part the entire lake you've been around there are some fish that live in here so you cast control water as keyleth completes the spell in a rapid series of hand motions concentrating her eyes illuminate with the power of her druidic divine energies she extends her hands and the water itself in the center of the lake the ice cracks up almost like a fissure is building in the center it's almost like tin foil being folded back from the inside out the ice is actually breaking and being pulled to the sides and as the ice is pulled back the water is pulled back with it like someone has torn into the surface of the earth and peeled the ice back like a sheet it forms this long tunnel that leads directly down into the center of the lake the water is being held aloft over the surface not actually being cast to the sides out into the river you could empty the lake for the most part if you wanted to do it now but right now you're just holding it aloft as these two water pillars you cannot refreeze water with this spell unfortunately you can just control its shape the temperature is a whole different ballgame okay the stonework-- you can start pulling the stones that block the area that lead into that one collapsed entrance and yeah you start moving things out of the way and they tumble down to the bottom and stick into the mud the bottom of the pond is a very interesting sight when it's drained all the plant life is just sucked together and you're all sloshing through you're up to your knees with each step as you just sink into the mud looking in there as you begin to step into the mud it is a thicker portion and your feet begin to sink into it to a certain extent you can control elements of it but because the earth itself is not part of it it does resist the spell effect so it would be very minimal effects as you step into it you begin to sink make a strength check all right the two twins are now (sucking sound) being pulled in into this small mire she's about up to her waist now up to upper torso vax is now getting to right around upper thigh trinket's all (concerned grunts) (chomp grunt) all right and with that trinket begins to back up (sucking footsteps) can't get traction in the mud he's trying to pull but is sliding in space there's no movement on this point you guys are trying to pull and they're not sinking right at the moment there is tension on the rope but they're not being pulled out either they're just held in place you guys are now in the center of the base of the pond no you guys are at the base of the stone structure which is not too far from the section they're sinking in you've been pulling rocks away from the crumbled entrance which is much easier now that there isn't water pressed against it so you're actually moving rocks out of the way and you're making some headway into this entrance you see out of the corner of your eye them talking and shouting to each other kima runs up to you guys looks over and goes ah they're fine and starts grabbing rocks easy enough to do the giant shimmering arcane hand of bigby scoops both of the twins up and dislodges them from the muddy surface setting you guys down gently and drifts to your side with a thumbs-up (laughter) are you scooping mud or are you scooping stone i didn't hear which one you're doing okay (laughs) i'll say the two of you guys make strength checks and you go ahead and roll a d20 and add your charisma-- no bigby's hand is-- yeah plus eight to it 16 okay 20 and four so you're helping yeah you're the foreman of this exercise but between grog and bigby's hand though large sections of stone are being scooped out and tossed to the side you're hitting the five- to six-minute mark it's a ten-minute duration you're a little past halfway okay you push some of the water out of the way some of it is splashing off to the side and being soaked into the local dirt and earth you're still holding about half of the pond itself up at the sides you guys are beginning to make headway through and you see a lot of the stones here have been pushed in with suction from the mud and kept a barrier and about three minutes later you begin to find an opening and you start pulling out a big plug of stone and you can see beyond that there is an actual stairway and a pitch-black lightless entrance that goes deeper into this actual structure okay so keeping the water at bay now rotating around your movement into the center you all make your way towards that rocky entrance it's just big enough to get each of you through grog and trinket at the very largest you all push your way through climbing in the other side keyleth concentrating steps inside as the last one as you begin with the last few minutes you have just taking it all chunk after chunk after chunk just at the tail end of your concentration the hand pulls in the last plug as the water (crashing water sound) comes crashing into itself filling the space as you all are standing there the light of zahra's staff lighting the area there's the impact of water rushing in against the stonework and you can feel the whole place shake from the impact and immediately water begins to rush in through the cracks of this created section i was going to say based on the push of the water against the rock and bigby's hand against that i need you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add eight for bigby's strength to try and hold the plug in place 24 total roll with that impact you can see streams of water pushing through and mud and other elements filling the gaps of the stonework bigby's hand pushing up against it looks like the stonework was ready to give and the water begins to go ahead and fill this vicinity the hand pushes back until the streams that are peeking through turn to a trickle and by the time the spell finally comes to an end the hand vanishes the plugged hole gives a little bit and then seems to keep itself in place water's still dribbling out and trickling there is still a gradual bit of moisture passing through here and you don't know how long it'll hold but for the time being it seems to be holding so as vax vanishes from your sight disappearing into the shadows down the stairway that leads forward we're going to take a quick break (cheering) you're all going to die all of you welcome back everyone so we've had our little break here a couple quick announcements to give to you guys one our first winner of the giveaway today of the chatroom giveaway for our various prize package is blackdeath2099 (laughter) today is our one-year anniversary of the stream (cheering) it's our one-year it's been a rushed day so i mean thank you guys thank you guys for kicking along with us for a year also guys wanted to let you know before we get started here again you helped our good friend here ivan is doing his kickstarter for the abc's of rpg's which is awesome but one of the stretch goals was to actually have a few pages of critical role-related activities for kids within the book and you guys succeeded in smashing through that stretch goal so he gave me a couple of the early designs to show off here's the-- yeah we can show a little bit of the preliminary stuff so this is the vex and vax connect-the-dots (cheering) on the paper then we have here we have the create tattoos for grog activity sheet so there's that one there and then here we have the percy connect your knowledge of the various fantasy creatures activity book so those are the really cool art pieces you can look forward to you guys kicked ass on making that happen and so we have our own little stamp in his amazing creative piece so thank you for that look to that there's also more stretch goals i think before it finishes up so if you want to smash those records feel free to check it out thank you for letting us be part of that ivan all right so now as you guys-- bringing it back to the game here i think those are all the announcements i'm supposed to make there perfect let me get set up here with some proper audio i want to get some good atmosphere here that got weird so are you guys all staying at the top of the stairs or are you staying a little bit behind vax's movement which one are you focusing on i think you have to choose the type undead you take a moment focusing here-- yes as vax pushes forward nothing catches your attention undead-wise there are no undead entities within the vicinity which you can focus on so that's one thing you don't got to worry about all right so the two of you have light from this pitch-dark vicinity which is helpful for those of human descent no undead presence in the vicinity vax pushing down this stairwell it continues down with a slight curvature almost like a gradual spiral staircase until eventually it hits a floor area the flooring here is at a tilt from what you can see this whole tomb this whole ruin when it sank in it sank at a slight angle and the surface of all the stonework here is still slick with water and various liquid that has trickled through over time you get the sense that there are a number of leaks within this temple and the pond that would grow larger is steadily slipping into this ruin and then being filled over time from the rainy and snowy weather as it hits the area as you hit the bottom and you look around you see ahead immediately across the way as you're the first in there two small humanoid shapes down this t-junction to the right and left of you are two tunnels and there is one ahead and about 35 to 40 feet ahead of you you see two humanoid individuals all right everyone roll stealth are you keeping your light spells up mary and both of you snuff the light spells so you have zero visibility right now stealth checks from everybody 17 with the plus ten 14 with the plus ten 24 okay there is no light these two figures just walk beyond what little bit you can see and both of you guys roll perception checks those with darkvision right now 14 the two of you can see these entities they're humanoid bipedal-- two arms two legs standing up on their legs however their feet are these webbed claw-type physicality they're wearing haphazard leather tunics wrappings around their wrists and they're hunched forward as they're walking away from you deeper into the shadows seemingly completely unnoticing of your presence their heads are these bowed-forward fish-type visions you can see they have these bulbous eyes at the edges jagged toothy mouths that end at this small point to the end very very fish-like amphibious-type entities they both scuffle alongside each other and shuffle into the darkness beyond down that further hallway yes left and right and in front where they both disappeared no they're just walking they're just walking they haven't turned back yes you can see both of them have what looks to be a cluster of ropes to one side hanging off their belt and have spears that they're clutching and walking along no they do there's no color in darkvision it's black and white they've all gathered down to the bottom-- okay so as the dagger gives off a bit of flame those of you with low-light vision have extended visual at this point at this point too as you're adjusting to the atmosphere here there is this very heavy smell of mold and mildew throughout this entire area and looking down you can see the bit of light dances across the stone floor that has water trickling across it and leading to one side to the left with the tilt of the floor what do you wish to do no there wasn't much detail about the tomb's actual build it spoke more of the history of the man who was buried there and gave reference to the direction you were traveling to just to reaffirm you were going in the right way no you learned information about the history of the man who's buried here it's not like every stone structure of ancient history has a book of blueprints available at your local 7-eleven yeah that's a little more expensive no you can see vax is holding out his flame dagger it has a little bit of fire trickling off it it's ever-so-gently lighting the very local area to the left you go to the one on the right okay so we have grog and vex are heading to the right sorry grog and vax are heading to the right and zahra and kash are going to the left anyone else everyone else staying in the center okay two of you stay behind all right so grog and vax you guys traverse to the right with what little light he's giving off the dagger it continues for about 15 feet before it curves sharply to the right roll a perception check grog 17 you turn the corner and manage to stop yourself just as your feet meet the edge of where the stone flooring has dropped out the tunnel itself here just seems to have ended and there is a chasm that disappears beneath your visual range a couple of stones (cracking noise) crumble-- you hear them after a number of seconds eventually hit with a slight splash of water you can see that this collapsed portion goes for about 20 25 feet and then the path continues beyond that for about another 20 25 feet and then comes to a halt at the opposite side so as you guys continue down the other way-- (laughter) you guys step down this surface and the water is pouring down this way and as you step there's this squishing sound not from the water but there is every ten or so feet there's a patch of very thick mucus-y slime that seems to cover portions of the wall and portions of the floor you slip a little bit and catch yourself and there is a residue that you have to slough off your boots eventually the tilted tunnel comes to a very tight spiral staircase that descends further down looking about your general vicinity very quickly at your foot yeah there's some make a nature check taking the slickness of it you were expecting some sort of secretion and there is no acridness to it there is nothing about it that seems to jump out at you as a natural creation by a creature you're not quite sure what the source of it could be it could be somehow over time slickness that came in through the water or some other source you really in your experience as a druid have no clear idea as to where this may have come from it doesn't appear to be natural the viscousness doesn't match anything you've encountered from nature so you're not sure what the source is it doesn't appear to be like a large snail or something like that the only reason you would know that is from your experience with subterranean creatures and studying that in your books and as you go through what you've researched nothing jumps out at you no actually no aroma whatsoever it is relatively featureless other than its viscous texture okay i need you guys to both-- no i'm kidding (laughter) they've gone beyond your vision you don't see them the path just continues on in the direction they were walking they have not noticed you and have not seemingly returned yet the two of you are fumbling in complete darkness right now sure i don't see why not so do you guys return with the rest of the group and the group continues down the spiral staircase at this point trinket finally comes down the rest of the staircase staying back from the rest of the group being stealthy trinket is actually far behind you'd have to back up to converse you guys have quite a large group here especially with kima involved you have quite the party this is going to be very interesting to see how it-- you guys are all making your way down the left tunnel down the spiral staircase that zahra found so you progress downward you're looking for-- just keeping an eye out both of you guys make perception checks with disadvantage very low light coursing down what catches your eye is a little ways down the spiral staircase there are a couple of small dark what look like minor objects that stand out against the rest of the stone structure they appear to be a couple of dark feathers they are beneath an actual layer of slick slime they've been there for a while but there are two feathers no actually owlbear feathers are textured with some layers of color like a natural owl-type entity would have these are jet black you recognize it very quickly they are raven feathers yes pressing down the spiral staircase it comes to another floor beneath the one you just hailed from go ahead and make another perception check you guys going forward it's the two of you at the front if she's behind you with a very faint bit of candlelight you guys have low-light vision so you can still make these checks right now but it's at disadvantage because it's very very limited all right as you guys push forward you reach out and stop vax before he takes another step as you notice this pathway now hatchbacking back in the direction you guys had come from on the lower floor you can see these very very thin about two inch wide slits in the stone walls to each side of you she pointed them out okay go for it this would be using your thieves' tools and for this it would be-- i will make this an intellect check with the tools thieves' tools proficiency plus your intelligence modifier correct because this is-- you actually have not encountered this type of trap before and you're trying to ascertain its nature without setting it off 23 as you step forward and begin to try pulling your tools out to inspect the nature of these looking into the dark paths on each side there's an instantaneous movement like a puff of air that comes out of each side i need you to roll a dexterity save 22 all right you (zoomf) just out of the way as these two pendulum blades (whoosh) right past you missing you by about a half an inch and then (whoosh) disappear and then swing back a second time resetting on opposite sides of the hallway you all saw that with a very (whoosh whoosh) make an investigation check based on the check you previously made these are a little more intricate and you're having a hard time finding a way to disarm them this would be more of trying to find a mechanism in which to disarm them which she is currently doing no well this is an investigation check ten you have no idea of the nature of these from this perspective you have no inkling or idea as to what the mechanism is where it's hidden if there is a way to be able to disable the trigger you have not encountered this before and it is a little beyond your expertise at the moment so while you guys are having this conversation scanlan you step directly up to the very edge of where these blades swing from and you notice that just glancing ever so slightly on the inside there is some sort of a latch that is guarded by the blade's embedded portion you realize as you put your hand forward you trigger some sort of arcane sensor that is part of this that causes the blades to (whoosh) swing back and as they swing past you you hear a click on the inside of the groove that they swing from and then as they swing a second time to reset it gives a louder click sound almost like it resets itself it's about a second it's (whoosh whoosh) it's about two inches wide the gap okay so you have advantage on dexterity-based ability checks currently you can try to are you going to do it all right so you reach over and trigger the blades pulling back immediately (fwoof) they pass back in that one moment you go for it make a straight dexterity ability check so roll a d20 you have advantage on it once you understand the nature of this it's not a very difficult thing to find you bring the blade around in that brief moment and as you bring your head into view to inspect the inside you can see there is a slight stone protrusion from within that groove you realize the blade probably isn't going to help at this point you reach over and just (tkch) you hit it with your fingers as you do you look quickly over to your right and the blade is already pulling back towards the area where your head is and then (creak crunch) halts and now the blades are just hanging (relieved noises) (laughing) that would have been very bad so as you guys continue forward down this long hallway heading at a slight upward angle now going against the tilt of this temple who's leading all right pushing forward it continues for about 60 feet there was a tunnel split over to the right side but that has entirely collapsed and is just filled with stone and it spills out partially into the hallway but it's easy to step over and get past eventually-- meaning the passage that you're walking down it looks like there was a path that went to the right that whole thing collapsed inward and is completely impassable it has spilled into the passage but it's nothing you can't traverse over his vernacular is impressive pushing even further forward the passageway begins to curve gradually to the left over about 20 feet and disappearing around a corner as you continue to push forward here you have moved beyond the light unless zahra are you keeping the same essence of light here to help with his vision you would have to travel up with him to be able to see around the corner as you move as you continue to move forward with him the light cascading further down the hall eventually the curvature comes to a halt and you can see before you a t-intersection of the tunnel across the way the tunnel directly across from you comes to a halt it just ends about 20 feet beyond this intersection there is a path to the right and the left make a perception check okay you can see in a similar fashion to the tunnel you and grog first discovered the floor that is the center of this t-intersection has completely fallen out as well there are sections of stone that jut out from the edges but it appears that this intersection for about a ten by ten foot area of the floor is just completely bottomed out correct nothing else visible in the area you aren't with them where it meets this center area it's only about a five-foot step over laura and to the other parts of the intersection as long as you're not going directly across if you're just going catty-corner it would be a relatively easy acrobatics check barring you don't roll a one all right as you guys approach vax deftly attempts to leap over to the right side of the t-junction make an acrobatics check perfect two-toed landing just (ta-ding) and you are immediately met with a wall it ends to the right it's almost like across the way and immediately to the right both just end abruptly go ahead and make a perception check you can see there are symbols burned into what looks to be some sort of a bird head that ends in these streaks that are carved into the rock intricately and done with a very careful hand okay it's not a language it is a symbol but you can make a religion check you guys have stepped up to the edge of the tunnel it's maybe ten 15 feet beyond the break 20 this being a tomb of a champion of the raven queen looking at this you gather this is the symbol of the raven queen (sploosh) (quiet knocking) solid stone okay so you get around and glance around the edge to the left tunnel there is no wall instead you're met with a large ten foot tall eight to ten foot wide double set of doors okay both of you guys make acrobatics checks okay yeah you guys make it across fine kima's getting impatient and she joins you guys across that way she's fine on her roll okay acrobatics check yeah don't worry trinket's fine the one was the killer so you hear a (yelp) as suddenly that slime-like mass that you've seen appearing throughout the stonework here has also gathered itself along the edge of this open crevasse in the hallway your foot hits it and within a moment the stones beneath your feet are beneath your feet no more and you find yourself about to plummet into this-- this is happening very quickly i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw to see if you can manage to catch the edge 17 actually no because there is slime on this i need you to make it a roll with disadvantage 11 you (grunts) just catch yourself on the edge your fingers are (shh) sliding off the edge right now you're barely holding on okay so in a very scar in the lion king moment (whoosh)-- (laughter) you do take four points of slashing damage from the claws that dig into your hands as trinket is holding onto you there then a vine streaks out from the stonework wraps around you and pulls you up out of trinket's grasp slamming into the ceiling and now holding you aloft before it drops you plopping right into the stonework between the rest of the party you go ahead and push on the door make an investigation check okay looking over it there is what looks to be a locking mechanism on it but it is not currently locked you push (thump) it doesn't budge you have to put some of your weight behind it to get it to shift at all and it (creak) opens up slightly into a pitch-black room ahead of you okay make a perception check go for it yeah yeah you (impact) around the edge-- ten it's hard to make out much detail in the room you can see what appears-- the room just lays out before you it seems to open up slightly and then even further partway in it ends on the opposite side with curved corners you can see what appears to be four pillars in the room that meet the floor to the ceiling the ceiling which is about 25 feet tall most of the tunnels you've passed through here are about 15 to 20 this is about 25 feet tall at its full height but these pillars reach to the ceiling and there are steps across the way what appears to be a raised platform that's the most detail you can make out of it at this distance-- you'd have to get close yeah make a perception check all right you all come to the same conclusion-- some sort of raised platform across the way okay so you guys stealth into the room you sneak in and you can see now this slime-type substance that you've seen throughout-- all right-- it seems to coat most of the floor and walls of this interior you guys step inside and with what little bit of light you have you see a couple shapes shift across the way behind the platform you find a couple of small pebbles okay (plop plop plop) as you listen you hear a couple of hushed voices (undercommon) do either of you speak undercommon you do light spell is about as powerful as decent torchlight it doesn't become crazy you know gandalf-bridge-of-khazad-dum-style yeah but it does light up the room and from what you can see now immediately across the way atop this platform there is what looks to be another stone raised platform or what could be considered as some sort of a tomb or stone coffin that lays atop these stairs on this upper platform there is another humanoid figure that stands on top that turns around at the light and you can see the light giving that weird ominous animal eye-glow whenever the light catches it at an awkward angle the fish face snarling at you robes drenched in various liquid and mucus-y fluid swish around for a minute as it turns to you this fish humanoid clutching this big staff you can see now three other of these fish-like entities all clamor up from the side holding onto these spears and these weird buckler-type shields on the side of their arms and they just (loud undercommon) laura and all right the rest of you-- right we have two of you have stealthed inside and you've rolled stealth for this it doesn't matter there's two big light sources in the front of the door this is going to be an initiative roll folks thank you dwarven forge dwarven forge folks mary and all right so this door here has been opened for the moment the folks that were still back in this tunnel here-- we have zahra and kash that walked in and created the light trinket is still back here at this point-- scanlan you're at the edge of the door percy-- and we have kima in the back there holding up the range across the way we have the one robed individual and these other frog-type creatures that have stepped out from behind here all righty so let's go ahead and get some initiative rolls folks yeah if you rolled-- 35 all right so 25 to 20 21 all right nice so grog is 17 scanlan is 17 yes 19 for vax what'd you roll five okay so that's15 to ten percy ten to five all right keyleth what'd you get four oh man kima rolled really bad too you have nine people in your traveling group plus a bear trying not to over-complicate this you mass-traveling assholes exactly all right all right so vex you have the top of the round technically you would sneak attack if you hit somebody who has not-- you don't know if they've seen you or not yeah i mean these are five feet each so it would get those two there if you were to do it it would get these two there this guy is actually beyond the ten-foot radius if you were to hit the middle guy okay go for it 30 hits-- pass without a trace now drops by the way all right so go ahead and roll damage against that guy correct so go ahead and roll that for the main guy correct 29 points of damage fantastic and then it is 2d8 against the other two if they do not make their dexterity saving throw so what's the dc on the spell well that's a natural 20-- one of them succeeds one of them fails so roll 2d8 this one takes 13 damage the other takes six okay so as you step out of the shadows pull back your arrow and release this bolt of blue lightning energy it fires across slams into this robed fish-person who shrieks out in pain the bolts then scatter off and shoot into two of the nearby ones one of them manages to pull right behind the pillar and manage to avoid most of the impact the one over here however takes the brunt of it and doubles over in pain almost falling onto its knees they start croaking back to each other do you wish to move yourself or trinket right here all right and trinket you want to move-- don't forget you have your pointers guys his movement speed is 40 you get there yeah all right that brings us to vax right here it's not a surprise because they were aware that there was an aggressive action coming in but you still-- correct so so it's three against this guy hits all three hit this includes sneak attack damage you have advantage no no no-- you don't have surprise it was ten plus whatever the dice roll is 68 if it's a surprise you-- okay 41 points of damage it's all good so after the energy from the arrow is still dissipating from the blast you've already rushed behind through the small space in the wall and thrown all three daggers all sinking into the body of the robed frog creature who doubles over from pain slamming into the top of the stone sarcophagus in doing so its hand hits it and a bunch of black feathers scatter off the top and come to rest on the ground at the bottom of the raised platform does that end your turn okay so that should be there all right that ends your turn kashaw they're about 45-ish 40 to 45 feet there's four of them yeah here i mean they're all within ten feet of each other ten to 15 feet all right dexterity saves fail fail and fail go ahead and roll some damage no you already hit with them sorry-- i take that back you just do straight damage to them and they don't get any reduction in that because they missed their saves so you just roll the dice and that's how much damage they take no it's 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage so 8d6 total okay so are you going to stay where you are or are you moving in okay so as you're moving by you grab onto your holy symbol look over and concentrate your eyes go dark black and one of the feathers that drifted off the top of the platform comes to rest on the ground between the three of them as the feather hits the ground it creates this opening of blackness behind them as they look down all of a sudden the darkness turns to bright searing light as fire and divine energy just slams up from the ground beneath them into the ceiling and you just hear these three simultaneous screeches as the flames die down there is nothing left where they were standing (cheering) all right and that ends your turn he doesn't have a turn anymore at this point in time-- there is this echoing mutter this almost burbling that seems to rise up behind kima and percy at this point you glance over your shoulder into the darkness below the collapsed tunnel and what little bit of light you see coming through you see something fleshy rise up from underneath it's glistening in places and immediately a cold shudder crawls down your back as you see a series of appendages release each with a gleaming eye at the end of each one as one giant eye rises up it-- as it rises up and kima looks over the shoulder-- shit it's going to be a beam at kima a beam at you percy and a beam at grog since you're visible against percy i need you to make a dexterity save a 19 okay great a dull green beam arcs past and you manage to just duck out of the way-- slams into the stone wall next to you of which that stone wall now just turns to dust disintegrated rock behind you the one against kima see if she makes her save here-- no she fails this beam hits kima square in the chest and as it does she doesn't seem to have any physical reaction but she begins to back up instinctually from it you can see her jaw agape her eyes wide open she looks like she is filled with the dread of the ages and the third beam going towards grog have to reroll that need you to make a dexterity save grog 19 great a strangely quicksilver-like beam strikes you center in the chest it hits you and you feel the muscles around your chest begin to seize up and crack into dust like the actual flesh is turning to a slightly hardened stone but you flex and resist the effect the petrification not beginning to take hold within your body so as it turns up its beam striking you after all the beams hit it turns around and (incomprehensible growling) speaking in a language you don't understand unless one of you speaks deep speech he's right above you he's just hovering right over your heads and it stops right above you grog that ends its turn you get two attacks 12 you go to swing and you miss entirely you swing with a 17 and once again just in your fury and anger in it flying overhead and the little bit of intensity of its reveal you just can't seem to find purchase on its body all right grog you want to move or you going to stay where you are okay you can get there fine okay as you rush past it's going to go ahead and use a reaction to make a bite attack at you as you speed beneath it oh that is a 24 to hit you take 14 points of piercing damage reduced to seven as its teeth just reach out and bite towards you streaking across your shoulder as you push out of the pain continuing forward all right that ends grog's turn scanlan you're up it doesn't seem to notice you at the moment no it seems to be intent looking towards zahra and kashaw at the moment as they are immediately in front of it you are correct ah it fails its save that's an 11 yeah go ahead and roll 8d6 points of lightning damage against it because you're doing it at a level three so yeah so 8d6 lightning damage 30 points of damage nice so as you release this bolt of energy you guys see this flash of blue light in the distance as the bolt slams up into the creature from underneath all its eyes whip around in your direction for a second before looking around all the areas around it it's still focused intently in your guys' direction do you wish to move or do you want to stay where you are okay percy's in your way so you have to back over in this direction no it's already made its reaction okay you take a d10 inspiration die so keep that on hand it's the best all right that ends your turn percy you're up correct yes if you wanted to move past it yes you could there you go that's about as far as you can get in a direct line keep it going percy what are you going to do actually lewis can you hand me that little template there the post to the left of it (offscreen clatter) so percy as you go to cast the spell you release the incantation nothing happens okay 15 unfortunately in your sudden fear of realizing the spell not happening you go to fire and it just ricochets off the stone okay 20 does hit okay or good to know the rays don't make attacks so the only thing that it would affect is his bite it just looks at you and the ray hits you and it's your attempt to try to get out of the way that's how it works okay go for it 31 that hits go ahead and roll damage eight damage so as you turn around the third shot fires it slams into the fish creature you see like blowing part of its neck out it (choking grunt) it's pretty heavily hurt but still standing it looks to be almost like with the pain it's withstanding as it's looking up at this it's reverent and raising its spear toward the beholder like (undercommon chanting) all right that's percy it is now that creature's turn all right six it's going to move up to you after you shot it percy it's going to make an attack with its spear on you with both hands it pulls up and goes towards you its big old fish mouth snapping oh that's going to be a 21 okay as it jams the spear into your side it hits your shoulder and just streaks off tearing into the flesh a little bit but it's not too bad you end up taking-- okay that's nine points of piercing damage all right that ends its turn keyleth you're up actually sorry before the end of your turn out of frustration at being shot it's going to use one of its action points to shoot-- i'm sorry one of its legendary actions to shoot another eye ray at random at the end of percy's turn yes it is going to shoot at you because you were the one that just shot at it no it's not going to shoot you because you are in its-- it would absolve its ray so it's not going to shoot you it's going to fire behind it instead at kima okay kima's strength save natural two so that's going to be the telekinetic ray it's going to move it 30 feet in any direction it's going to lift kima above this hole and just drop her kima unable to do anything at this point struck with fear from the previous ray and is nowhere near the edge is just thrown off and plummets into the darkness below where the beholder originally emerged you just hear her scream (screams) as the echo continues past you don't even hear an impact that sucked now it's your turn keyleth i will say go ahead and roll a dexterity check just a straight dexterity check as you look over-- --before you have an opportunity to get that thought in your head she vanishes into the darkness what are you doing keyleth right now you're not no so you can move-- okay okay constitution saving throw-- 11 so yeah full damage 33 damage nice so as you look up you channel your spell energy into the essence of withering life force and you can see a portion of its back the slime dripping from its form the flesh shrinks up and shrivels and it shrieks out some of the eyestalks quiver and look in the direction of where you are and some glance down and see you correct return to form that ends your turn at the end of your turn it's going to use another legendary action to fire another ray this one is going to be-- this is going to be at scanlan as it's the one that's clear and behind it it sees you transform into earth elemental form-- you can travel into earth you cannot travel into like solid stone carved stone not immediately visible actually there is in the wall that it disintegrated when it tried to shoot percy so yeah right up in here there would be okay (slurps) you vanish into the wall there but you can only emerge from that same spot it's the only exposed earth in the vicinity but you are in the wall okay it's going-- and since you've disappeared it goes ahead and takes the ray shot at scanlan scanlan i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw no this is not a spell it is not an actual attack-- but you can use cutting words to reduce the damage if you want to your dexterity save yes five ability checks ability checks not saving throws so you can see one eyestalk that was looking for keyleth hones in on you and this eye has no iris just a deep thick black pupil and a streaking beam it sounds like a shrieking voice just (shrieks) streaks out and slams into you this black solid beam you take 55 points of necrotic damage that ends keyleth's turn kima's turn we're going to find out does not make the acrobatics check-- okay you hear a distant echo of a slam of impact that seems like the breaking of water along with the hitting of stone you hear this distant echoing (groans) ouch correct the hit of water and stone sounds like wherever she landed it was shallow enough to impact when she landed but not enough for her to like sink or anywhere but she is right now effectively out of this fight ending her turn zahra you're up you're not within its main eye but it can see everything around it all right what level well what level would it be it would be your max level as a warlock so you yeah correct well technically it would be 6d12 if you're doing it at a sixth level go ahead and roll to see if you hit first you have to roll to-- it'd be a d20 and add your ranged spell bonus okay so you rolled a 20 total that hits go ahead and roll 6d12 lightning damage 24 okay so 26 all right so the lightning blasts into its side one of the nearest stalks just looks over at you to acknowledge the impact and you just hear a slight snarl as the eye looks out of the corner towards you is that going to end your turn brings us to the top vex you're up it is looking in your direction you don't know we'll find out when you stop to there you would still be in the eye range no because you revealed yourself in the attack you did a little while ago i mean you can duck partially if you want to use an action to try and hide you can do that so trinket moves behind the wall there looking over at you you can see noticeable fear in trinket's face all right at the end of your turn it's going to use its third legendary action it's going to take another eye roll-- another eye beam this one is going to fire at grog (groaning) nope we'll see what it does though all right i need you to make a constitution saving throw 19 all right cool so as a yellowish beam streaks across and slams into your back you feel your back muscles tense up and lock up and you resist the effect once again you just have that hardy constitution of a goliath who seems to be resisting every one of these beams that slams into you for the time being vax it's your turn you'd be just within 60 feet go for it you used your bonus action to hide so you get two attacks right but you only have one attack with your main action you have to roll a stealth check to see if he sees you or not 25 okay so go ahead and roll your attacks 18 hits and you do have advantage on these because he does not see you hits both hit go ahead and roll damage and sneak attack on the first hit because he did not see where you were surprisingly being an entity covered in eyes seven yeah all right okay got it 37 rushing up behind the side ducking into the shadows you go around the pillar and-- watch one dagger spin around and watch a second one both of them sinking into him adjusts in place angrily from the pain and impact but-- yeah cool that's what breaks your stealth not the attacks strangely okay that ends your turn kashaw you're up everything else except for you and percy are directly out of the main eye but his eyestalks look all over the entire room and they keep shifting and taking in the awareness of the surroundings but the big eye is just staring right at you intently you don't know possibly you have not encountered a beholder in your time go ahead and roll an intelligence check just modifier do what you want to do i mean you can move six squares 30 feet so yup sure okay that ends your turn it is now the beholder's turn the beholder is going to float up towards the ceiling of the area-- this is going to put it at-- this is going to be-- let's see-- need to find something to weigh that down actually perfect all right so it is approximately 20 feet up right now which gets it out of predominantly melee range of most anything at the moment the cone still spreads in the area and it's going to look right there so it looks away from you kash so what action did you want to prepare okay all right so constitution saving throw-- that is a 19 where's the dc it resists the spell unfortunately however it is now going to make three eye ray attacks let's see who's in the radius here it can't get a ray towards the four of you so it's going to do one ray at zahra one ray at you kashaw and another ray at zahra zahra gets two rays so mary i need you to make a constitution saving throw if you need it 18 okay a similar yellowish ray that hit grog earlier strikes past you and it hits you but you manage to resist the effect a light blue ray streaks across towards you kashaw i need you to go ahead and make a wisdom save yes slams into you a wave of intense sleepiness comes over you but you shake yourself out of it third ray goes towards you zahra i need you to make a dexterity saving throw 17 you manage to duck out of the way as it slams into the wall behind you this entire chunk now is gone you see there's a chunk of rock and earth that has been exposed on the opposite side as it just disintegrated that portion of the room that ends its turn and now-- because at the top of the round-- out of one of the slimy surfaces in the room you see all of a sudden the stone opens up a phantom eye that just appears out of nowhere not even attached to this beholder as it does another beam streaks out of it-- yes this is going to be-- this'll be at scanlan the eye for this one will be streaking out of this pillar here no no it'll be this pillar or this wall here and it just hits toward scanlan in the vicinity of the room 20 all right as a familiar beam hits you and begins to lift you off the ground you manage to grab onto the side of the stonework and pull yourself out of its force before it can throw you into the same hole that kima had tumbled into all right grog you're up okay okay go ahead and roll for an attack that hits with a five it fails its saving throw so you take a plus one strength he takes a minus one strength 19 all right great the blade sinks into it as you yank it back go ahead and make an athletics check to pull the blade back that's an eight-- you yank on the chain and it's just still embedded in the bottom of the beholder you can't seem to pull it back you did yes all right grog is that the end of your turn scanlan you're up you lucky lucky gnome it's your turn 20 feet up technically right at the roof it might you don't know depends on where you're hitting if you aim it up here it may hit grog over here well you can't see that wall area because it's all blocked there you can only see through this passage so you can only hit anything on the ceiling and this way unless you move into the room okay so we'll say about there is where you can hit it go for it okay what is the dc for the wand not for the wand no the wand has its own dc it should-- okay it does make the save so it takes half damage so go ahead and roll damage on that currently with the blast area-- no and it would have hit percy except for-- as the fireball explodes the fire just seems to dissipate around the cone actually absolving the flame from its current position he is affected yes 15 points of fire damage okay the blast and you can see some stones (thuds) from the ceiling from the impact of the blast it weirdly shapes around the cone in the front of its eye and do you want to move or are you going to stay where you are take a d10 inspiration dice for that all right percy it's your turn okay so using your quick draw you-- well you have one hand so you can pull out a second weapon so go for it 19 hits ten points of damage with that you eviscerate-- as it croaks out (croaks) and just falls to the ground gurgling into a pile yes nope yep and then you get a next turn let me check the rules real fast just to make sure because i don't want to screw you over let me double-check because the internet will let me know if i mess it up it's technically readying an action so-- how it is with this essentially is you wait for the trigger or you can ignore the trigger which means if you want to you can just do it at any point if it never happens so at the end of the next person's turn you could unleash-- totally yeah yes the spell is used unfortunately beholders man they're assholes towards which way one more if you want to okay does not have legs does not have wings hovering entities aren't really affected by prone you would know that go for it 18 just hits scanlan comes through again keyleth you're on deck so be prepared 28 points of damage that's the end of your turn that's all your attacks okay that ends it with percy at the end of your turn percy it's going to do one of its eye rays this one is going to be towards grog because grog is out of the cone and rushed underneath throwing the blade up and stuck into it one of the eyestalks shoots down-- okay grog i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw 21 all right not a worry you manage to duck out of the way before it slams into you all right it was a black ray that streaked towards you a ray you're very familiar with all right keyleth it's your go not from the ceiling no you currently only have two-- no because it's mostly flame it's the impact and explosion it's not enough to damage the structure of it unfortunately it is considered worked stone if you wanted to like shape up there and try and break through it you could attempt that okay okay so you-- what's your movement as an earth elemental 20-- 30-- it's cutting it close all right go ahead and make a strength check with the strength of the earth elemental seven no you pull up and you slam your fist into the stone beneath you and it cracks a little bit but not enough to give way at all so you are currently resting up in this vicinity i mean that's your action and your movement kima can't do anything right now so kima's just currently trying to heal her wounds a bit she can heal-- at the end of your turn it's going to attempt another eye ray this one is going to be at kashaw five through-- well actually those they don't have to reroll for the same because they're each different turns i need you to make a dexterity save kashaw 21 you guys are rolling some serious fucking saving throws as a dm who loves using a beholder it's really frustrating (laughter) witch bolt is an action to use and it only does 1d12 well you have to use your action to do it which means you can't cast any other spells if you do it yeah all right so go ahead and roll three attacks with your ranged spell attack against the beholder plus okay so that hits second one misses and the third one all right so go ahead and roll 1d10 plus five 11 points of damage as your beam streaks and blasts it from the side-- both of the attacks do not get the magical bonus to hit and damage so whatever your attack bonus is minus two to damage and hit actually it would be minus four all of your magical equipment doesn't work when you're in its eye right but your actual bow is magical and adds to hit and damage minus two to hit and minus four to damage technically it's just supposed to be plus two to hit on that item actually misunderstanding it's all good so that hits and the other one is this is with the minus two okay they both hit roll damage on each minus four all right 15 points of total damage as you streak around releasing these two mundane arrows from a mundane bow momentarily both hit and you can see now it's starting to look a little rough it's hurting there's streaks of blood out of various wounds it's taken it still has craven edge jammed into its underside stuck in its craw all right so that brings us back to the end of zahra's turn where it uses its third and final ray yeah you can move if you want to where do you want to move okay this last ray is going to-- this one's going to be at scanlan since all of the rays have hit everything else everyone's in his cone or hiding and scanlan's the one little visible one there all right i need you to make a constitution saving throw scanlan 17 all right jesus christ guys you take as this shimmering purple ray slams into your chest you manage to get most of the ray to not impact you in the flesh but where it hits you do take some damage so you suffer 16 points of necrotic damage all right vex you're up you would be yeah you'd have to get over there to get to a space out of it that hits hits misses you get two hits on that with the sky sentinel correct okay go ahead and roll for attack on that one as the arrow ignites in the middle of the air the enchantment is too strong and actually burns the arrow to a cinder before it reaches its target just scattering ash against its body okay actually currently all of the areas of the wall are taken by trinket and kashaw you could have trinket move out of the way all right so at this point in time now you can see where the slime all over the walls-- all of a sudden a series of tendrils begin to whip out of them all right so good to know so now pretty much all of the slime-covered walls in here and within this hallway are now reaching out these semi-translucent almost created out of the same slime tendrils that are reaching out and grasping yes out to here so it's within ten feet vax it's your turn you have to guess you don't know the specific elements of his ray well first and foremost at the beginning of your turn i need you to make a dexterity save all right don't say you're using evasion yet it doesn't damage you or you could have wasted your evasion for no reason however you do avoid being grappled as they try and grab onto you and hold onto you you can use your bonus action to-- all right roll a stealth check 25 okay all right right there you do not have advantage because it rolled a natural 20 on its perception check and you are not stealthed that hits that misses nine points of damage a little toothpick impact that ends your turn kash at the beginning of your turn i need you to roll a dexterity save ten the tendrils wrap around you and you're currently grappled which means you cannot move you could yeah if you really wanted to no it's just holding you in place you can certainly try to yeah so he's going to make his dex save which he makes so he takes half damage but go ahead and roll 8d4 oh sorry 8d6 points of damage 26 nice so half of that would be 13 13 points of fire and radiant damage as the column of flame bursts up around impacting you feel the impact from beneath you from the blast of it maybe you're grappled so you can't move you're there all righty that ends your turn it is now the beholder's turn the beholder is going to turn this way it's going to back up this way and it's going to stare down in this direction now do you want to hold on you get dragged along holding onto the chain (laughter) so that's going to be three eye ray shots yeah you're in the cone it can't hit you with its eye ray however based on the visual there it's going to be two rays against kashaw and one against you vex yeah yeah the eyestalks can see you from there from that vantage point at the very top yeah against you kashaw i need you to make a constitution saving throw nine your muscles tense up and lock as you are paralyzed for a minute you're frozen while being held by the tentacles you can't do anything on your turn it still saw you i need you to make a dexterity saving throw 21 yeah you manage to duck out of the way this part of the wall actually however blasts out from the impact there as the disintegration ray destroys the stonework all right and kashaw i need you to make-- oh no you-- you can't you are paralyzed so you automatically fail dexterity saving throws all right the beam hits you and your skin begins to turn a dull gray as you begin to see your flesh beginning to harden around your body that ends its turn grog you're up okay so this will be your bonus action to pull it out make your athletics check yeah you pull the blade out and catch it in your hand (laughing) okay all right at the end of grog's turn-- actually grog i fucking forgot to do that i need you to make a dexterity saving throw which you have advantage on you're fine all right so at the end of your turn it's going to do one of its reactionary eye rays this one is going to aim for vex again because you're one of the few out of its area okay vex i need you to make another dexterity saving throw 14 okay you keep rolling high it's interesting i'm missing a bunch of different rays because they aren't even doing anything well this one however a similar black ray streaks downward and slams into you you take 55 points of necrotic damage all right that is going to bring it to scanlan's turn that's as far as you can get there 25 feet you're a gnome man tiny little legs you don't know we'll find out if you try something it doesn't work that way buddy sorry where okay where were you putting the hand by the way okay you're fastball special-ing him with bigby's hand i am so about this (laughter) okay i want you to go ahead and make a strength check so roll a d20 and add eight okay the hand grabs grog rears back and just full strength lobs towards the beholder grog you go flying up in the air with the added strength of bigby's hand behind you what are you doing okay you get plus eight onto each damage roll from the force of bigby's hand well plus eight to damage not hit yeah so the first one they're reckless attacks so you have advantage on them 19 hits second attack 22 hits go ahead and roll damage on them oh this is going to be nasty man ooh as you go streaking through the air grog arc once with the blade across the top severing a couple of the eyestalks the second one tears through it fails both of its saves with a three and a two (cheering) however you pass over and also then plummet immediately to the ground (laughter) falling prone you take ten points of damage from the impact halved to five-- well no it's not bludgeoning damage it's just falling damage yeah you take ten points of fall damage and are prone on the ground no bigby stays there it's a bonus action bigby's just chilling right there where you left it so all right great that ends-- at the end of your turn scanlan-- those words make no sense to you but it sounds like a nice song (laughter) all right so at the end of your turn scanlan it's going to go ahead and use another one of its eye rays this one's going to be at you make a constitution saving throw scanlan 11 you take 36 points of necrotic damage from the enervation ray all right percy you're up there okay sure that hits yes nice reload 23 hits okay looking rough man beholders (gunshot) reload (gunshot) reload a second time (gunshot) third and final shot each time blasting chunks out of its flesh you can now see like bits of teeth are shattered from the impact the eye's now bloodshot and dark blood is like seeping from under the large eye it's like (groans) at the end of your turn it's going to do its third and final one all right this is going to be at zahra no zahra you're in its cone so it's not going to aim it at you you're paralyzed-- so it's there-- vex you're up okay vex i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity check yeah you're fine 23 all right the interesting rays aren't coming up it's really pissing me off these are just like rays that just do damage there's ones that do cool stuff all right keyleth you're up yeah the wall yes it has like no armor class yeah go ahead and roll damage double damage the ceiling breaks as you move forward falling down how many attacks do you have as the-- true so you do one slam attack to break it for a second attack you could attempt to-- oh you can attempt to make a slam attack to push it down if that's what you're wishing to do all right go ahead and make the attack that was awesome okay 21 that definitely hits let me just-- there we go all right so actually that would be your athletics check what was the athletics for the form strength yeah so what's the total yeah 18 that works so no damage is dealt but you punch the beholder down back onto the ground and you land at its side right there it's like five feet above the ground it's still within-- you're not on top of it per se because you didn't grapple you slammed it so you land next to it essentially you take six points of fall damage from the impact no big deal that's right is it a magical ability checking right now right but as part of the-- that would be a grapple as opposed to a slam so unfortunately that wouldn't be the case and for-- wild shape magically assume the shape of a beast as you fall past its eye-- (groaning) no that was the placement where you were above it unfortunately all right that ends your turn though zahra you're up sure okay you go ahead and cast the spell and as you reach behind-- no effect one way to find out what are you doing zahra you're aiming at the screen i don't know where that is all right so go ahead and roll a d20 with your spell attack modifier go ahead and roll your damage so that's 5d12 all right so it's 35 points of damage on from the five-- well the plus two's after 35 times two so that would be 70 points of damage 72 points of damage all right how do you want to do this (cheering) okay my token's not facing the right way all right so as you glance over at scanlan and give him that visual perspective of let's do this you glance over reach out your hand and pull bigby's hand towards you it streaks up and grabs the back of the beholder like a baseball just palming it thrusting it down towards you zahra its mouth open it reaches down teeth open momentarily frustrated by the moment it's going to use this to try and bite down as you reach up you slam your staff up into its mouth and release the witch bolt at ground zero from the inside of its body the eye widens for a second as the top of the staff pierces the upper part of its palate and with a burst of black and bluish electrical energy the entirety of its skull just (explosion) just detonates from the inside sending chunks of slimy flesh and bone and whatever brain matter resides inside the cranium of this beholder scattering across the room yes you are yes well as the beholder dies the ray eventually fades off-- and the tendrils retract into the wall you hear the voice echoing from inside i'm all right relatively speaking as you come down pulling your dagger out and using it as a torch down in the inside as you're lowered you can see there are hundreds of partially eaten corpses of those fish humanoids that you encountered earlier as well as what appears to be various cradles of gathered slime and putrescence the real core of where this beholder had been existing at the bottom of this tomb kima's down there currently holding one shoulder you can see she's tended to herself with her wounds for the most part on her own but just currently looks up like i've got nothing as soon as you descend from the pit dangling from the rope she goes okay good roll investigation okay okay so you guys move up and push the sarcophagus open as you guys slowly start bringing kima up the rope itself tense with the weight 'cause she's wearing a lot of armor but it manages to pull her up without issue you go ahead to the top of the sarcophagus there and it is covered in black feathers some of which got pushed off in the battle you shove the top open and you can see inside a skeletal corpse that is resting surrounded by what looks like very very fine golden and silver jewelry that have just been laid at its sides and on the corpse itself you can see there is a set of jet-black studded leather armor that has a series of runic engravings and carvings along pretty much every square inch of the leather and you can see around the the mantle of it where the leather mantle falls the edge is trimmed with black feathers make an investigation check 15 you find what looks to be-- roughly within the brief time you've spent and you've spent like a good ten minutes kind of like combing through the slime you find about six gold pieces plenty of fish-guy bones yeah all right it's beautiful with the echo it gives it this sort of reverberation effect to it okay as kima gets pulled over the edge you reach over and help she's like thanks appreciate that i-- that didn't go as planned i'm a little embarrassed it was a very long fall and i survived that-- eh nothing i couldn't handle no (laughs) make an insight check no man she owned that fall i mean there are chunks of there are a few full teeth that you could try and take not a whole lot left to harvest like it is destroyed there's a few eyestalks that you could probably pull sure go ahead and make an investigation check okay i need vex i need percy and i need trinket to all make dexterity saving throws you find a bunch of shitty spears crappy leather and through all them all about 12 gold pieces you manage as you reach out and grab for the armor as your fingers touch it there's this vibration and it seems like the shadows the nearby shadows in the corners seem to reach up towards your hands you pull back in time but you and trinket notice a little too late as there's a burst of death a burst of death energy that just bursts out for a ten-foot radius around the entire sarcophagus you avoid it both you and trinket suffer 56 points of necrotic damage does that bring you below zero vex's body falls and hits the stonework and you look over as you see her eyes stare up the last bit of air escaping from her lungs as the life drips out of her form the healing potion has no effect and as you go to her you can already feel the clutch to her skin her body is instantly cold from the necrotic blast you glance over at the sudden intense energy of the room and see your sister lying cold and lifeless on the ground being cradled by zahra do you have it prepared do you have it prepared as one of your prepared spells check your list to see if it has a little dot next to it okay no effect you rush over you reach in your pouch and pull out a bit of clustered diamonds in your hand that you keep just in case for such a circumstance and as you place them out you sprinkle them across her chest pushing vax a little bit away knowing that you need the concentration on this at which point you pull up the symbol and this type of magic life and death magic draws a little closer than you feel comfortable with vesh and you realize at this moment that you're going to have to make the choice to possibly call her attention forth okay so we're going to do a quick ritual skill challenge as part of this revivify enchantment so as you grasp the symbol and as you do you can see all of the scars across your forearm begin to light with a deep red crimson energy just (hissing sound) and you close your eyes and as you look up you can see kash's eyes just go straight black and this dark energy begins to swirl off and as it reaches out it touches the diamonds which then shatter upon impact and the dark energy seeps into your sister's corpse the back arches though she does not register on the face or any of her movement her body lifts slightly in place her arms just draped dangling and scraping against the stone beneath her as she's elevated there how do you guys want to help with this ritual okay so you place the residuum across where the diamond dust was shattered and use that as almost a focus for the energy from the spell all right i need you to go ahead and roll an intelligence check just roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier that's for saving throws not for ability checks what did you roll six the energy itself vibrates within the glass shards which then shatter seemingly not able to focus the energy of the spell okay so as you take the moonstone and-- are you speaking to your patron to aid with this all right so as you take the moonstone and hold it aloft you place it near the focus of kashaw's ritual the dull white glow begins to intermingle with the dark shattered energy of vesh's grant and as they impact it creates this strange grey swirl i need you to go ahead and roll an arcana check roll a d20 and add your arcana skill to it okay the grey balances and where the two meet now there is just grey energy seeping into her body you focusing look up at the altar where the body was and you see the very faint drifting image of a dark female form looking on who wants to make the third and final attempt to aid go ahead and make a persuasion check with advantage 11 okay at this point the dark female form that drifts from the altar you glancing up intently feeling the sudden intense fearful gaze of vesh upon you as it gets closer and closer the presence is different what you feared was vesh is not vesh actually it is an image a specter of the raven queen herself the face is formless at this proximity you can't make any details it's just this perpetually blurred female form of a face the hair just tumbles down past and as it steps forward no expression no words the hand reaches out towards you vax there's a nod the magic strengthens focusing through your moon crystal into vax's body i'll take a picture of this so that no one questions this a moment passes a second moment passes the vision of the raven queen nods the head to you steps backward and the specter vanishes (gasping) breath fills vex's lungs as she begins to cough her form drifting back to the stonework your vision clears and you find yourself looking up at the partially broken stone ceiling of the dark altar into the face of your brother tears streaming down his face the rest of your friends gathered around no at which point you immediately have this perpetual slapping of wet bear tongue across your face as trinket is just (bear noises) nuzzling up against you and like pressing all his weight against your body to an almost intense degree no that's-- the moment you touched it is when that blast went off as you walk back up to the altar and look on the inside the corpse is dust the blast whatever it was while it didn't damage anything seemingly the remains are dust the armor is laid there same place it was when you found it if a little slumped in without any sort of something to fill it out also most of the jewelry that's there has turned green and seems to have been robbed of whatever precious metal it was once contained the only thing that sticks out to you is what looks to be a black crystal that comes to a point on one end it has a loop on it like it was part of a medallion or a necklace or some sort of a loop to carry on a chain those are the only two things you see within no the leather is there the corpse is gone yeah yeah it's pushing the boundaries of mage hand but you can try yeah it's full leather armor you can just-- i'd say-- well all the runes are inscribed there you can make an arcana check or religion check one of the two probably would the language is a forgotten language it has been dead for-- probably since before the divergence but your eyes clarify on it in the arcane nature of your sight you pick up phrases throughout and it is a tale of the creation of the raven queen it is a tale of her ascendance from mortal to immortal it is the history of her penance for ascending and taking the throne of another entity that was supplanted it's just seemingly a history tale that is woven in with a very very strong enchantment and you see within each one of these little runic sections there are mentions of elements fire ice lightning you know it runs through all these various elemental arcane properties that are bound into this enchantment you're not entirely certain what the nature of it is okay it is very magical it is very enchanted and i'd say based on the circumstances in looking at this whatever the blast that was set off here the runic elements that maintained that trap that were in the sarcophagus are currently expended you can take the black crystal as well you don't know but there were two runic circles within the inside of the sarcophagus that were not visible when you first looked into it that are both now visible and expended of energy yeah you'd probably have to take some time with it like a short rest to go ahead and ascertain the nature of it so you gather your findings your first retrieval of one of the vestiges of divergence a success barring difficult circumstances you make your way back out through the tomb yeah well it wouldn't be an issue we'll say for the sake of story brevity you guys make your way up through the temple in relative silence just taking in the moments that have transpired through the aid of keyleth and the rest of the party you manage to make your way back out the way you came parting the remnants of the marrowglade loch and start making your way back in the darkened evening hours towards vasselheim do you want to rest on the outside of the loch here okay now it's keyleth and kashaw-- as you guys head back the rest of you have gathered at the same camp set-up you had the night before kima-- while you guys were doing this kima's fixed a little bit of a meal at the base and set up her own bahamut arc of protection on the tree below where you guys are set up as everyone gathers around she kinda gets your attention for a moment and goes all right so best that i can understand we have most of our allies and many of the survivors at your place right in whitestone while you're seeking most of these things that's where the bulk of our hope resides this is also you say where allie is and where the rest of the survivors of the council are okay well for the time being i'm probably going to head there and make sure that we have defense in case any of these dragons manage to get some sort of wind that this is where their possible usurpers are they're going to hit it and they're going to hit it hard want to make sure that we have at least a decent chance of defending these people so i figure all strength that we can spare beyond those that are searching for these artifacts go and stay there at the moment besides it'd be good to catch up with a few friends myself you're welcome to join us in whitestone we could use the help over there i can guarantee you probably seeing what you guys can do today we can definitely make use of that better over there than killing things for cash here in vasselheim but to each their own just a noble cause helping your friends whatever and just to put this out there and i don't mean to say this in any selfish way but i'm really sick of sleeping in trees do you have one of those tree travel things you have already to whitestone i could really use a bed great as the tree opens-- teleport via plants as the tree splits open showing the portal kima whose eyes light up looks over that-- well played druid well played and she charges through eagerly and you guys all follow suit out of the sun tree in whitestone and find yourselves a comfortable bed to sleep for the evening and that's where we'll call tonight's game i know it was long but also due to scheduling shifts and y'know will couldn't stay for the next week i didn't want to have to leave in the middle of that i wanted to give you guys closure to the arc so thank you for staying for a long session it's only the champion of the goddess of death man huh i rolled a 12 the dc starts at ten each failure increases the dc by one and a success lowers it by three so it had gone to 12 and the success had brought it down to a nine if i had rolled an eight or lower you'd have been gone for good well she would've been gone for good you would've had to have made a very serious journey elsewhere possibly to make that exchange you still could've done raise dead it just would've been a little more expensive no no no no raise dead is a proper like resurrection-type spell it just is really expensive and it's a ritual there are limitations to it revivify is good but it has to be used within a minute which means when you used previously before and we were in mid-combat and i didn't want to do the whole frickin' ritual in the middle of the battle so i let it go through thank you mary and will for-- yeah i know man that was that was a good-- that was delightful overkill that was like six points left on that beholder and you're like oh like 70-something he was wrecked guys well done well welcome back glad we're--
