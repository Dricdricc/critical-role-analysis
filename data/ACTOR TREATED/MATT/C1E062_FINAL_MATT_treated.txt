well first and foremost guys i want to thank all of you for being here tonight for what is already the craziest night of my life in a long time and we haven't even started really which is nuts i want to give a big thanks to the dungeons and dragons team and wizards of the coast for gifting us an awesome series of gift bundles that we'll be able to give out to some of you lucky winners here in the audience and some of you lucky folks at home as well there'll be information for that throughout the chat as those events arrive and also in that same vein thank you to them for helping me and chris come together and help make the event of force grey giant hunters a new series we've been working on recently coming out (cheering) so that's interesting yeah as if i didn't have enough free time already now i'm putting that together but yeah the first book is going to be a tal'dorei campaign setting specifically within exandria and if that does well hopefully we'll be able to extend that to other continents like issylra with othanzia and vasselheim maybe marquet and wildemount we shall see but the first book i'm really excited about it's a labor of love and when that does come out next year i hope you guys get a chance to enjoy that so yay (cheering) all right enough of that bringing us into tonight's game of critical role the last time we saw them the group of adventurers vox machina had found themselves in the feywild intent on discovering another one of the vestiges of divergence one of the many artifacts that they hope will aid them in their struggle against thordak the cinder king and the rest of the chroma conclave defeating two of the members three still remain thordak being the seeming powerhouse head of that troop so now deep in the feywild a crazy alternate dimension in which fey creatures rule a landscape where up is down and everything is topsy-turvy and nothing is what it seems they've made their way through the moonbrush parlayed with a group of lycanthropes-- werewolves werebears weretigers-- and a group of pixies and made a choice the pixies now scattered and stapled to a number of trees in the forest the leader of their troop an extremely large powerful werewolf lord named ukurat has pledged his aid to some degree in the near future should you need it as you travel duskward past the gilded run eventually to the source of where apparently this bow fenthras exists in the shademirk bog and now we pick off where we last left off the rest of you after resting in the treetops on the outskirts of the duskward side of the moonbrush you've come to consciousness gathered your things escaped the forest and headed northward just beginning to see the cresting edge of the tangled river mass of the gilded run and beyond that the dark ominous shadow the shademirk bog so before you guys press anywhere forward is there any preparation you want to take on your adventure you're about to travel forward what do you want to do roll an investigation check no oh you strongly recall information that inform you that the last bastion of true civilization is long past you south of where you originally came from vax turns to you and goes yeah i usually feel a bit that way quiet as you guys are preparing for the morning there's a strange sound like a simmering high-pitched whine two or three times you see these sudden bright flashes of light in your vicinity and there's a burst of white light as out stepping from it you see the somewhat-corporeal divine energy-based form of pike trickfoot (cheering) garmelie at this point watching this whole circumstance walks up to you and goes it's good to see you again i don't know where you went away last time but i hope you enjoyed the last sketch i did if you need any more let me know i got plenty of paper you look down and see the small faun who you previously had commissioned to draw-- well thank you kindly let me know your form's closer to mine so it's easy for me to get a full view (laughter) make a perception check (laughter) first roll of the night 18 okay glancing ahead of you you see the hint of the peak of an ominous mountain range slowly growing in the distance at the base of that you see a treacherous weave of powerful rivers rushing past and around the exterior of the shademirk bog these large heavy trenches of water jamming and folding into each other you've heard of the gilded run and you've seen a few stationary rivers in the past but this is a cluster of perpetually rushing rapids that fill a rather sizeable period of the land surrounding the actual shademirk bog and you can see just past it the edge of the bog itself these very dark glistening almost black oil-caked tree canopies that vanish into shadow beneath but that's a couple of miles off you can see them maybe half a mile in front of you and you can see the spray occasionally shooting off some of the rocks and the shore of the river just barely shows the speed of the water passing by okay so you decide to walk the half-mile to make it to the river it's a series of long rivers that completely wrap around the shademirk one side of it seems to be vanishing into the green sea which you could barely see to the far seaward side of you and it curves around the outside of the shademirk and vanishes into the horizon do you want to get close to it first you have a jaunty jog on your way towards the gilded run a very short time passes before you begin to actually hear the waters in the distance and as you begin to approach about a hundred feet from the edge of the first stripe of river and you can see some are tighter together some are only a few feet between the rivers some merge into even thicker roaring rapids they're all traveling from the seaward side to the tangleward side in layman's terms west to east the rivers change in width the smallest one you can see is maybe ten feet across some of them swell to upwards of 30 40 feet depending at which point you come across it they're all pretty matching in speed and they're pretty hefty you can see there are occasional rocks in the edges of water that are just spraying causing the water to smash into the side and split off around it there's nothing visible in the water drifting through most of it is destroyed in the process of crashing against the rocks in the sides of the bank fine i'll go ahead and give it a look i suppose although you can fly any time you want if you wish he seemingly ducks down into the grasses that you guys are standing in and vanishes barely giving a small path as he disappears occasionally you see him glance up and loudly grumble i appreciate the backup sister and he keeps continuing forward as you get to the edge of the water itself he looks inside it's pretty clear the water as you can see the bottom of it right there you can see a deep-set blanket of greenish-brown algae-type plant life that cakes the bottom of the river floor the occasional stone protruding from it and everything is growing and pushed around it he releases his raven wings from his armor which shoot out in a large 15-foot wingspan on each side he jumps in the air makes his way over the first short river and lands on the other side okay glance over his wings fold behind him and he's like was it so hard sister really (sighs) he scoots underneath your broom as you're hovering on and one of his wings catches the edge of it flicks and then tries to knock you off your broom make a quick strength check strength my dear as the edge of his wings smack the back side of the broom it spins out from under you and for a moment you grasp the edge of the front of the broom and it slips from your fingers you flick off tumble to ground about ten feet not too far you take one point of damage from the impact nothing huge but as you roll to the side your broom scatters across the stones and dips partially into the river which begins carrying it slowly-- okay you grab it and pull it out as you turn back over your brother's sitting there with his arms crossed his wings still folded smiling make an attack roll this is not with your bow by the way this is just adding your proficiency bonus you're not even proficient this is an improvised weapon so you have disadvantage go ahead and roll again you're not proficient really in attacking with brooms 13 with but an instant of reaction time it passes a good solid foot and a half in front of his face his wings furl a couple of feathers dangle down and he turns around and decides to hop over the next bit of the river i know sister as he takes off any of you guys also doing anything or are you just watching them scouting ahead as you scoot up to catch up to your brother he's probably a good 15 feet ahead of you-- as you hop up after him you notice his wings go into a dive and he ends up curving downward at an alarming rate diving right into the river i need you to make a wisdom saving throw as soon as you see your brother dive into the water you begin to coast downward as you do there's an impulse in your head that begins pushing and steering the broom lower lower and even in the back of your head you sense this is bad we're going far too steep it's like you're outside of your physical body the control has alleviated itself and your body forces you to splash into the river as well both of you guys submerging yourself in the raging rapids you guys see this in the distance with a splash of two impacts on the riverside there is a ten-foot river for you guys to traverse first before you get to them each of you who are trying to leap across make an athletics check i said anyone who wants to try grog's got two gnomes on his back of course he does that's perfect two gnomes on grog's back you grab both of them do a quick sprint and leap as heavy as you can go ahead and make an athletics check much like how hulk escapes a fray you watch as grog bounds into the air in a large arc slamming into the other side causing the stones on the outskirts of the riverbed to crack beneath him you stand back up proud of yourself pike and scanlan you're a little jostled from the impact you smile as you hear a splash behind you percival getting right up to the edge and leaping as his foot catches the stone and goes right into the smaller rapid being carried as well keyleth if you take a moment to watch-- the three who've been pulled under the river-- that includes you vex'ahlia vax'ildan and percy-- i need you to make a constitution check 14 okay you manage to pull yourself up to the surface and you almost get to the point of actually getting some air and a force pulls you back under however percy you do maintain the breath in your lungs you and your brother both (coughs) give away a bulk of the air and you feel yourself in the beginning spasms of drowning you know what yes you can in the aspects of this sequence though it is a difficult job to cast this is it a concentration check or not but is it a concentration spell that is the difference from you guys out there they're maybe 25 feet from you that's all right so i need you to roll another constitution check if you could okay so yes as the rapids are rushing by you open your eyes and the sting of the very high-powered water hitting your eyeballs causes you to have a hard time even seeing what's up and down as you glance up to where the little bit of light from the ever-dusk sky of the feywild pulls your attention you put your hand out and using that burst of ranger magical energy you watch as the undergrowth of the river itself stretch out and form this strange slimy mass of vine that wraps around you and yanks you out of the water surface slamming onto the ground just outside of the river (applause) no vax is in the next river over percy is about maybe 20 feet from you but is quickly being rushed down the river percy okay just pat it (shushing) it's okay gilded run it's okay all right perfect so you see this influx and see vex get thrown out of the river you see percy's hand get pulled back under as the river pulls him along at a very fast speed you concentrate and as you put your fingers forward you see the rapid river begin to slow down at a certain point and it's almost like an invisible dam gets held up as the waters continue to flow out and carry him a little bit further it slowly descends to leave him on an empty bank of water as the rest of it slowly seeps to a much lower level you catch your breath percy however i need you to make a wisdom check as this is a very powerful magically-enforced river and it's currently combating the strength of your spell this is keyleth she's making a wisdom check all right feeling confident in your druidic ways but unfortunately not yet undergone the formal training of the water ashari the actual forceful wave of the river begins to push back your control over that being and then cascades down picking percy once again back up an additional 30 feet down the stream you are at the surface at the moment though you are not considered drowning you're not drowning your brother not doing so hot well before we get to that the three of you guys now get to act fine you go and take your inspiration die okay taking bigby's hand i need you to make a strength check for bigby's hand if you could add a plus eight to it 25 you watch as bigby's hand plunges into the river itself vanishes for a few moments and then like a reverse cannonball out of the water coming curving around and at an incredible speed looks like it's about to spike vax onto the water's edge before slowing down and limply dropping him on the edge of the bank front which is good because the pat actually forces the water out of his lungs (coughing and panting) no flight okay i'll say it is your turn because he move quite a bit down the river but you have a pretty high movement rate as a barbarian so you tie the chain around yourself at your full movement speed and you get to the very edge of the bank and begin to wade in just as you pull the jar over your head and that's going to be the end of your action there pike you're holding him at the edge i need you to make a strength check if you could i believe it's a plus four 18 without an issue you watch as this giant anchor of a man is being held solid by this tiny rock of a gnomish cleric you watch as her teeth bite down and her tongue sticks out the edge as she digs her feet into the bottom of the river rock percy you see a dark form in the river as you're rushing past i need you to make a perception check with disadvantage as you're being drawn underwater this is a perception check with disadvantage 14 okay just as you see this strange dark form appear out of the way you instinctively sweep your hand out and you smack and catch the edge of grog's pants at the hip and you catch it grog you see the hand emerge and you catch the edge of it and pull him up out of the river he's now out caught his breath he's no longer beneath the surface you guys are still being pulled now by the water your feet are beginning to fall out from under you as the rocks that are holding you up are being pulled along by the force of the river it seems the longer you're in the river the stronger it's getting i need you to roll another strength check pike as you pull them in there is a little more weight on there so the dc's going to be a little higher go ahead and roll if you want to yeah she's taking it now so roll a strength check and add even with the fantastic rhymes of scanlan's voice ringing in your ears and you're holding tight you feel your heels begin to scrape as the river rush is pulling you now towards the river grog and percy you feel yourselves being brought deeper into the center of the river yeah you do so coming back to keyleth at this point keyleth i'd like you to make another wisdom check if you could just a check 16 that's better as you guys are being swept away you feel the current begin to subside slowly and pike once again you get your ankles dug in you begin to pull on this and between the two of you and the concentration of keyleth you manage to wrestle grog and percy's forms out of the river onto the bank now you guys are between the two (cheering) yes there are a couple of small trees that are planted or grown up between the river banks and you can still hear the rapids rushing past looking ahead of you there's probably 12 the experience when you were trying to cross over was reminiscent of that urge to jump whenever you're near the edge that weird very base impulse whenever you get to a point of danger that says do it it's like that being triggered and preyed upon it would take you guys about 20 feet across it looks like some of them swell between each other and then split off again some are solitary from your current position that you can see but you only have what's immediately near you to really see since some of these are hills and it carves into part of these hills you don't have a complete view of how they intertwine and merge beyond the immediate hillsides he's back on the other side some help please i told you i've heard about this land i haven't actually been here it's dangerous and it keeps the shademirk from spreading no i'd say it's getting towards the end make a strength check being a small and relatively light-weight fey creature but also smug in a standing position after proclaiming his negative approach to grog's idea he doesn't quite notice the spiraling purple hand that swings up from behind grasping him and lifting him into the air with an incredible speed all you hear is the distant (squeal) as the hand full-on fastball special chucks him arcing overhead (distant scream impact) a little plume of dust he made it past five of them (applause) which gets more and more awkward the longer it goes by until eventually you see a shift and this small form rise up raises a thumb which quickly transitions into a middle finger (cheering) make a wisdom check if you could no they just haven't been charged properly (cackles) so as you guys begin to prepare your attempt to cross the river keyleth concentrates the river stalls for a moment and then pushes past seemingly unaffected mind you the spell does seem to have an effect when you're having a better time concentrating but it is a magical force versus a magical force and you can see it actually angrily swells against the resistance that's where the actual tension comes from there is something living like an entity that these rivers seem to almost mingle as there are a few sporadic trees scattered around yes they're not that tall some are maybe 15 20 feet up these trees specifically are a little more marsh-based they're not quite swamp-based trees but that's as tall as they get no these are maybe five feet wide oh the rivers sorry the trees are five feet wide i misunderstood yes the actual rivers are between ten to 20 feet probably close to 150 feet you go up to one of the nearby trees at the edge and you can see across the way it looks like there's part of a crumpled stone corner some long dilapidated ruin you can see what looks to be one dried tree log that has fallen over and rotting on the other side but there is one tree right on the edge of the bank that you guys are on that leads across this next river that is pretty solid looking maybe four feet in thickness there and 25 feet you're tying the rope to an arrow okay you have at this point a good seven minutes left okay as you guys grasp hands both of them vanish in a swirl of purplish-pink smoke you see simultaneously across all the banks right at the edge of the shademirk this little burst of energy you guys land on the ground immediately your feet sinking about three inches into this black sludge-like tar material already you can smell the outskirts of the shademirk it's a very sulfurous decay smell that permeates the ground by you and you can see it seeping into the river like a slow-moving morass of syrup and the water carries it away upstream like an angry force of cleaning it's a little sludgy where you stand but you guys are across 17 what did you roll okay just making sure because ones are always fun for situations like this all right you fire the arrow it goes a little wide while you're aiming in the proximity of scanlan and arc off and staples to one of the outside trees sticking in it the rope goes lax and begins to be carried in the water and you can see the tension as the river itself seems to be trying to pull the rope underneath the rapids okay you begin pulling it up and it's hard to pull up the actual river is almost pulling the rope under itself all right i need both of you guys to make strength checks together what's the range on control water yeah you can do that i'm assuming it's a low roll all right so what did you guys roll for your strength checks as there has been no druidic aid unfortunately in this particular moment as the two of you rush over the 30 feet to the tree that the rope is stapled to right now it's taut and you can see it's starting to break the arrow as the strength of the rope being pulled into the river between the two of you guys you manage to slowly pull it out of most of the rapids it's still being dragged by one it takes you another minute or so but you manage to get the rope entirely taut against the edge of the arrow pike you catch the actual rope on the other side before the arrow snaps and carries it back by the strength of their pull so you take it and you make a little knot tie it strong from your experience as a sailor to the immovable rod and it is solid and in place he looks to you and his wings (whoosh) he lets them dissipate as they're not going to be much of a help in this moment if i'm going to be tied to the rope i want to be tied close to you at least he shimmies over you're all tying yourselves like a daisy chain all right once you've all affixed it what is the order in which you guys are affixed i'm just curious he's in between the two of you guys right now he's waiting good he looks over his shoulder at scanlan and goes good all right you guys all begin to pull yourselves forward on the rope taking your time to make sure that if anything bad happens you take a moment to pause and help out your friends i need everyone who's on the edge of that rope to make a general athletics check everybody who's currently tied onto the rope so not the gnomes yes i'm going to say no so that's 20 what did you get 22 okay you guys begin to pull yourselves forward the two half-elf twins in their physical waif-like state begin to find themselves being carried hard down the first second and third progressive rivers as you guys pull through but you manage to make up the slack and get them back on the land each time it slowed down your progress you only have three more minutes on your spell all right you manage to make it across the next six or so rivers you get to where garmelie is who's sitting there tapping his little hoof impatiently he looks up at the rope which is basically head level give me some slack thanks he wraps it around his midsection ties it up and it's uncomfortably tight because as soon as you start moving it pulls on his midsection when it's pulled taut because of his size he's actually lifted up between you guys so his feet dangle and he's top-heavy in how it tied so he rotates his feet are in the air (cheering) harnessing the inspiration of frustration at your recent failures to control the elements that you've been so hoping to learn to bring to your beck and call you look forward at what would be the third-to-last river in your progress forward and angrily do this with your hands you guys watch as the river like a paper is torn asunder the water held at bay you guys run down the bank stepping over as you start to reach the other side of the bank grog your heavy foot hits something that seems to react to the impact of your weight you guys make your way up the edge of the river as you glance over the side you see something in the mud vanish beneath as you guys all get across the water slams back continuing to flow with the river angrily it roars and seems to almost swell up over the bank where it once was before it slowly descends back to its natural rushing rapids there are two more rivers now ahead of you there's one right before you and then the one that separates you from scanlan and pike there were roughly 12 ahead of you when you asked you guys have now traversed nine of them ten of them so there's only two left at this point keyleth the actual near-growl of the rapids begins to slowly subside in the river before you as the water sinks down into a slower more gentle pace you can see it building up and backing up behind you as the river here comes to a soft cool dip that you guys can begin to walk through as well yeah make a perception check grog being in the front of the troupe as the river is slowly separated for this you step down into the mud and you don't notice a similar shift curl up behind you as suddenly a rapid (whoosh) a set of gargantuan long tooth-filled jaws come pouring out of the mud underneath the bank snapping towards your large half-giant form (evil chuckle) it has begun that is a 22 to hit i believe that hits your armor class all righty getting ready for the first real attack damage of tonight's episode you suffer 27 points of piercing damage (groaning laughter) most of you go flying in an arc at the sheer force of this impact i need you guys to make acrobatics checks to try to stop yourselves acrobatics all right and your brother does well of course he does you guys all manage to catch yourselves right now still attached by the rope as you now see this heaping 15- to 20-foot-long giant barrel of muscle green scaled skin but what looks to be hundreds of tiny roots that spread from the center of its midsection reaching into the ground as it begins to move forward it's actually rooting and uprooting itself as it moves you can see the moisture and the life force of the land is pulsing into its form as it holds grog in its jaws i need you all to roll initiative (cheering) you guys are way over here on the edge please remind me the marching order again if i recall it was grog grog percy thank you garmelie was between the two of you guys yeah perfect you get to see a little behind the field there there he is there's garmelie great so top of the round we have initiative of 25 to 20 all right so keyleth a 20 20 to 15 anyone all right 15 to ten scanlan and pike what did you guys get the gnomes bringing up the rear all right so keyleth you're up first you watch as this giant mass of a creature is now clutching grog in its jaws and you see its tail begin to whip up and it's now guarding itself on all sides as the roots are dragging themselves into the earth around you elements of it as you get a closer look now you can see parts of its scaly hide emerge into leaf-like protrusions it is a strange mixture of both giant croc and some sort of a plant-based entity all right this is a perfect keyleth moment so speak with plants generally works with plants he does however in the purposes of this type of circumstance it's usually meant for smaller plants that have no sentience that you can normally interact with like roses and petunias you can probably communicate with it yes i'm saying issuing commands on this might be a little more difficult for the rest of the spells this is not a spell that can be cast at a higher level unfortunately so what do you want to do you're casting speak with plants make an intimidation check (cheering) as you shout this out pointing at the large crocodile-like entity you look deep into its beady black and purple eye that darts around in the sunken socket of its crocodile skull and you can see it re-initiate its clutch on grog readjusting pulling him even further into the jaw grog you suffer another nine points of piercing damage another nine points of piercing damage sorry keyleth are you going to stay where you are sure you get that far before the rope on your midsection stops you grog your turn he has you in his jaws by the midsection and he's trying to turn you so you lose your footing and you're getting pretty close right now so he has you clamped right around your hip and chest right now the nostril's right here and the other half of the jaw is almost completely wrapped around the side yes you may all right so you use your bonus action to go into the rage and you have two attacks so go for it that'll hit that also does hit yes roll damage for both of those strikes all right 24 points of damage 20 points fantastic so you're slamming it as hard as you can with the axe in the side you're jamming it into the side you can see part of its jaw split open from the impact and you can see a gleaming of white slick bone beneath that begins to expose from where you slammed the sharp end of the axe into it twice in a row it's (snarling) shaking you in its grasp once more does that end your turn grog all right next is the croc's turn at the beginning of its turn you watch as the wound you just left begins to slowly seal shut you watch the roots protruding from its body begin to suck the water moisture and life force from the land around it and it begins to heal itself slowly so some of that damage goes away it begins to heal itself healing from the ground it's rooted into grog 24 i believe that hits you guys watch as the crocodile backs this way slightly which allows vax and garmelie to get an attack of opportunity vax does hit well no it could be sneak attack although grog technically right now is not threatening it i'll let it sure the timing is pretty close on this and you'll hear why in a second 31 points of damage from vax garmelie misses he is awesome so as it pulls away you guys watch as the crocodile spins around in the direction of you guys grabs and tugs grog throwing him up into the air in doing so all of you guys get pulled this way and keyleth dragged behind at that point the jaws open and grog vanishes down the creature's gullet you all got dragged right to the edge of its mouth so right now percy you have the rope right at the edge of its giant snapping jaws this creature's pretty profound at swallowing larger entities so that's fine (laughter) yeah things go to darkness you now have a general idea of what scanlan and vax went through oh but a few days ago cool yeah you are completely locked inside of it right there it also spins around as it does so and its tail (whiplash) whips out and you see at the very tip of its tail what looks to be some sort of strange jagged stinger this is going to whip around in the direction of you vex that is going to be only a 14 yeah you duck under it as it scrapes across the ground causing this huge section of the dirt to grind past leaving a small trough behind that's going to end its turn it is now your turn vex trinket appears at the side of it suddenly spawning out of this strange burst of shadow energy from the center of your necklace (roars) trinket happily does so he has advantage on both of these strikes go for it you would have to pull a dagger out and that would be a bonus action so you can do that now but you wouldn't be able to cut it until next turn okay hits yes we'll say the first one will be the bite and then the claw both hit roll damage for each eight eight damage all right total of 20 points of damage as trinket tears into the side of this giant gator-like creature as you pull your dagger out you're like hunter's-- damn it but yeah at the beginning of your next turn trying to hack away at that rope that's fine that ends your turn vex unless you want to try and move currently yes and you don't have your broom at the ready perfect well done percy you're up hey percy you are in melee with the creature you have disadvantage on your ranged attack roll again (groaning) don't even try it okay that does hit i would say given the fact that you said specifically that you were too nervous to do sharpshooter you're also too nervous to remember your hex but you can finish your turn with that if you'd like no that's true you can do it i'll let you all right marking that down what's the save dc on that that is a 12 so yes it is currently blinded there we go and you are hexing it you said okay good to know correct the mouth is currently slightly open maybe you can certainly try what did you roll as the jam you rolled a natural one okay roll damage anyway yeah without the hex damage bonus grog you take ten points of piercing damage but it does jam so as you go to fire it splinters off and there's a burst of smoke and the heat hurts your finger and you hear this dull (impact) on the inside and a (grunt) it's halved yes this is to try and clear it though you still have to clear okay yeah so you manage to get it cleared and get it back and ready to go using it as an attack is a reload make a strength check if you want to use an action on your next turn to assist with this then yes that'll be your action eight as you say everyone push away your feet feebly glide against the muddy surface of the riverbank as the jaws open slightly and you hear the low guttural (growling) the breath comes pouring out into you in this strange combination of muddy swamp low tide and compost it's delightful but you're all mostly taut on the rope now so you can that's what you tried to do and it failed miserably that's your turn percy vax is up now vax tries to push inward actually no he's going to stay where he is out of range he's going to try and throw his daggers from where he is he is not going to use his haste boots though he's going to save that for later that's two attacks both hit so with the first strike and with the offhand throw the first one with sneak attack because it is currently next to percy you are threatening it at the moment 28 points of damage and the second strike for a total of nine so after vax throws both daggers both sink into the sides of the giant crocodile it moves ever so slightly with the first impact the second one seemingly to no effect both daggers appear in a puff of smoke to the side of his belt and he looks to you and goes sister what are we going to do he can't really move at that point it is now garmelie's turn garmelie who can't turn invisible who can't use his normal tactics is just um he pulls up a small pan flute from his side and (whistling) there's an awkward pause and he goes shit he then tries to scoot away as far as he can but is once again caught between the very taut sides of the rope unable to shift that brings us to pike you guys are over here so i'd say from what you can gauge here you're approximately 40 feet from it you go right up to the edge of the water toes dipping in of course you are so that is 8d6 damage if you hit go ahead and roll your radiant attack against it spell attack bonus roll a d20 roll a d20 add your spell attack bonus yeah 15 just hits so 8d6 points of radiant damage and it is currently marked for an advantage on the next attack against it as a giant bright light now bursts across the front of its head causing its eyes to retract and close in pain (snarling) 24 not too shabby 24 points of radiant damage and the glowing divine beacon now flashing in the center of its face causing it to close its eyes the next person that wants to make an attack is going to have a nice little bonus is that the end of your turn you're going to stay right there at the edge of the river okay that's the end of your turn pike scanlan you're up they're within 60 feet that's a lot of missiles after the flash of the guiding bolt the rest of the party you look across the way as you see scanlan after singing this delightful song turn around rambo-style and release this burst of arcane energy these arcane darts come firing straight towards the croc and in a moment of excitement expecting each of these impacts to blast into the side of this creature they suddenly soar up into the sky and arc down towards each of you before you have a moment to really react the word leaving your voice what they streak back down slamming into each side of the rope causing it to burst into frayed burnt rope chunks and pieces of twine all hanging loosely to your sides all of you guys are now free to move about as you wish well done top of the round again keyleth you're up anybody whoever has the next attack roll against it has advantage well it makes the saving throw with disadvantage and the spell deals maximum damage to it so what's the spell dc of this 19 you can come look at it if you want to i understand (chuckles) 15 this is going to suck so that is 64 points of necrotic damage as you clench your hand like this you guys watch as the roots that connect to its body suddenly begin to wither and dry out you watch as the outside bark then cracks and turn to ash and dust at its side and its once verdant green hide begins to curl into this dull gray lifeless husk the creature's eyes spring open and its low guttural growl turns to this horrible shrieking pain sound from the inside grog you feel everything tense around you as its form all of a sudden is being drained of the life essence and water that keeps it going it manages to recover and the life pumps back into parts of it but that sucked that is not a happy creature (applause) all right so you move past to this side sure closer's great grog you're up you're currently still constrained inside its body the tautness of the rope around your waist has gone slack so in a moment you realize either your friends are dead or they managed to break the rope you would think that if you weren't so full of anger and rage at being shot and squeezed and devoured by a giant crocodile what are you doing we'll say you can take your action to reach into your bag of holding and pull it out yes well he had it out earlier have you had it on your head this whole time if that was the case the sheer force of the creature biting you initially and throwing you onto the bank would've tossed that jug quite a ways away from you that's what i thought so do you want to spend your action to rummage through the bag of holding and pull out the jar that would be your action yes you can use your bonus action to attack because you're in a frenzied rage you have disadvantage on your attacks you can still attack him from the inside you can certainly try is that what you want to do as your mind is suddenly clouded with the thought of jug i need to get the jug no you feel your body your physical form begin to ripple and swell you guys watch as the crocodile now currently recovering from the blight-like withering of its form suddenly its eyes go wide once more as its gullet begins to swell wider and wider you hear this low (retching) like a cat coughing up a hairball slowed down as you watch an enlarged grog get immediately vomited up and out of the creature to its side yes you do have benefits to that so yes you manage to do that sir okay as you rush away he gets an attack of opportunity on you it does have disadvantage because you shot it last turn which is good because the second roll was a natural 20 that's a total of 20 to hit what's your armor class okay so it just hits you with the bite you do have a reaction so yes you may yeah it's not inspiring somebody it is intended to distract the opponent and this crocodile probably having a rather rough time in the early 2000s manages to provide even more bile from its stomach at the sound of a rehashed hanson song go ahead and make your roll you roll your inspiration die no it's a d10 you were intent on that happening as it reaches out to try and bite towards grog it hears the sound and its head quirks vomits a little grog you manage to get away at that point we'll say about that far as you turn around the daisy chain has not followed you glancing down the rope that was once around your waist has snapped by the growth in size and all the rest of the ropes have also been snapped sorry perfect that ends your turn it is now the croc's turn it's going to make a bite attack right now this is going to be at percy since you're right there in front of him with disadvantage that is a 23 that hits you all right as the head turns back towards you it opens to the side and tries to clamp on you that is a 34 34 points of piercing damage and you are currently grappled and restrained the crocodile has now snapped its jaws moving to percy and percy you're currently held tight in its jaws it's trying to lift you up now possibly to fill its now terribly empty stomach it lost more than it originally started this battle with as it swings around its tail in doing so its stinger sweeps overhead it has a reach of ten at this point we'll say in that arc there this is going to be towards vex towards you vex with disadvantage still that's a 21 what's your armor class 20 okay so it still hits you all right so the stinger (whipcrack) grinds itself into your flesh tears through the armor separation there and you can feel pulsing i need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw well you take 16 points of piercing damage from the actual stinger itself striking you you now feel that pulse of venom through your body and as it begins to swell through you you feel all the colors and all the images of the landscape around you begin to shift and bubble and move you are tripping balls right now you look to your left and see garmelie next to you whose frightened expression becomes suddenly this giant feral wolverine that hisses at you you look to your right and you see the giant crocodile holding percy suddenly merge into one strange giant medusa creature you don't know which way is up and down and you are extremely frightened and confused well that ends the crocodile's turn and it is now your turn currently you cannot take reactions and i need you to roll a d8 to see what you do (chuckles) you're so stunned by this moment and your brain being completely turned around what did you roll roll of five okay you take no action and you use all of your movement to move in a random direction you go into the river you turn around and begin to flee looking ahead of you you see what seems to be a moving sea of grass and all of a sudden you feel your feet (splashing) the river begins to pull you away at the end of your turn make another constitution saving throw as soon as your vision comes back to you and a breath of relief hits your form as suddenly you have control of your form as it begins to be sucked under the water end of your turn percy you're up you're restrained you can attack you can't move and all your attacks have disadvantage i don't think you count as an item i'm sorry i don't think that's how it works it's not like you hit a couple fingers and they drop a cup this is a massive muscle currently clamped on you trying to swallow you i know sorry okay so we'll say you use your bonus action to draw your weapon it's right there by your side you pull it out go ahead and make your attacks against the crocodile 15 just barely hits actually technically it would have been the first attack since pike's guiding bolt thank you for the reminder of that so it would've been a normal attack yours didn't have a spell attack it just instantly hit and made a save so technically what was your first roll yeah you hit the guiding bolt wears off however that did manage to get rid of the disadvantage on that one strike seeing the bright side of its face you take your blade out and hack downward for the first hit which does strike true across the side of its face you can make your next two attacks on his next saving throw but he's not making a saving throw and if i'm going to be a stickler here sam the next time he has a saving throw i'll keep the disadvantage in mind yeah all three strikes hit go ahead and roll damage on all those slamming into the side of its face you begin splitting open a section of the side of its head you can see its cracked withered form from the blight spell earlier has become a little more brittle and each impact is cutting deeper than any of the previous hits has we're going to take a quick break here five ten-minute break to use the restroom and return to the apex of this battle [break] so on vax's turn vax is going to go ahead and dart around this way behind garmelie getting to where trinket is flanking along the river bend there as he does pull out of the range of the tail the croc can go ahead and make an attack of opportunity with the stinger out towards him behind that is not going to hit that is a natural four that's going to be like a 16 so yeah as it swings with its tail wide to vax vax ducks beneath it arms up to the side leaps in the air and catches himself right on the edge of the bank he looks over and notices you running off to the side immediately decides to put his daggers back away and then uses a dash action to dart over to the edge of the river where you are and is going to reach out and try and grab your arms you guys are reaching for each other right now that is how it's going to go for this moment that brings us to garmelie who now free of the rope circumstance and the chaos around looks and sees you out in the river scoots around goes out with grabs your brother's arm and then reaches out towards your arm and chains his way towards you putting his hand towards you grab so you guys grab and link arms at that point he's going to go ahead and make a strength check to pull you out of the roaring rapids okay he manages to hold in the moment but doesn't actually get any ground on pulling you out of the river so now it's just him and vax holding you at the edge the river's pulling you harder and harder and you can feel the actual swell getting stronger but they're still managing to keep you in place that ends his turn pike you're up he's looking hurt you've noticed each time it's had a moment to itself its roots have dug in and it's pulled back into its form yeah it has been still regenerating every round yes what are you doing on him sure all righty where do you want that flame strike to land wherever you see it onto the middle of its body as you look over in the distance unable to really see beyond the form of the creature you bring the flame strike down onto its form it's going to make a saving throw with disadvantage because of your cutting words which is good because it rolled a 17 for the first one and it rolled a 15 for the second one no dex bonus for it because it's not very fast your dc is 18 yes 8d6 radiant damage go ahead and roll that that's a ten-foot radius i'll say for the sake of knowledge in the area too and seeing trinket attack you manage to pull it out of the range of the bear not wanting to ignite him scanlan you're up next how much fire and divine damage 28 points of damage as you guys see this gathering of small reddish and white divine particles circle in the air faster and faster and then (boom) a column of divine flame strikes from the heavens blasting into the side of this creature it rears back (roars) in pain as you see now its slightly withered blight-impacted grayish-green back is now burnt to a black crisp and smoke begins to rise off of its form it's very pissed off is that the end of your turn pike are you going to stay where you are what's the range on it 60 feet yeah you can get to him from there so you're casting healing word at second level go for it roll the dice all right scanlan you're up real fast pike that was 2d4 plus five no just add plus five all right scanlan what are you doing it would be classified as a huge creature all righty so let's take its wisdom saving throw against your dc that is a six with no modifier it is certainly sickened though its disadvantage has worn off of course take your inspiration die grog all right staying where you are scanlan keyleth you're up you are all righty saving throw against the dc with disadvantage a six and an eight (laughter and applause) you hear the phantom chanting in the back of your head how do you want to do this percy is still in its mouth yes as you slam your staff into the ground with a giant ripple all of a sudden you watch as the various plant growth in the ground begins to turn to a dark black gray at the base of the staff it curls across the ground like the actual line of blighted death and decay seems to spear out across it manages to catch the bottom and sink up the roots of the creature as it begins to swell up into its body you see it taking form how do you want the blight spell to take hold in its body all right so as the blight spell spirals across his body like a spider web crackling it begins to (snarl) it rears up with its arms out in front of it taut the muscles locking up like this giant arching statue its jaws up in the air holding percy aloft (laughter) on that note too i need you to make a strength check right just a check (chuckles) you and vax and garmelie still hold your ground but unfortunately not a whole lot of physical strength in this daisy chain right now you can yes and trinket rushes over (moans) comes up behind vax and bites the back of his cloak and begins tugging on him as he's now being slightly strangled by the bear pulled back toward trinket adding his strength to that what's trinket's strength bonus with a roll of a 17 that brings it to a 21 whereas you began to pull them in towards the river trinket makes up the back end of it and manages to drag all of you out of the wake onto the side as you get up and cough out the water trinket comes up to you and nuzzles you on the side of your face (moans) what was i supposed to do watch you drown no we're almost to the end of our agreement trinket rushes up and looks up at you underneath with open jaws as grog large grog comes lumbering up (heavy footsteps whack) with one clean hit the bloodaxe carves straight through its body causing the upper part of the torso to slam into the ground with a big speed upon the impact it rolls a few feet taking percy in its jaws you do suffer two points of damage from it but eventually you hit a point in the bank where the jaw cracks into a hundred pieces and you tumble onto the ground and catch your breath after being restrained for so long as you extend your fingers about you you see small strands of green go (popping) and you hear a hundred soft voices go eh okay the very tiny pressed stomach interior of this creature petrified as it is it's like staring into one of those weird high school science room half-man organ presentation statues you can see where the folds of the stomach lining are there appear to be some remnants of bone some entities that were partially digested but nothing that catches your eye to be something worth pulling out of it and with that (shatter) the pieces of it go scattered all across the ground elements of it tumble into the water and get washed away it is no more many small petrified crocodile pieces one more technically you guys have all made your way across there's one last one that leads to the outskirts of the shademirk go ahead and make a perception check make a strength check which you have disadvantage on hold on because you took a point of exhaustion from frenzied raging during the battle however you do get advantage on strength checks while raging so it's a singular roll so the natural 20 stands so as you pick pike up she smacks you in the face the grin crawls across and you (whoosh) lob her she lands in the top of a tree you see (cracking) in the bushes as a few leaves dangle down you can see some gloppy black stuff out of the side and you hear this muffled voice in the distance as pike landed okay vax says i'd rather run and he goes running forward and attempts to make a leap across the river he leaps makes it most of the way catches his ankle on the edge and begins to flutter backward yeah however he does manage to right himself he only got partially into the river and managed to pull his way out so he's fine grog who are you throwing next go for it strength check (grunts) you lob him it's enough to get you across but the landing is not very graceful 21 you manage to use the actual momentum to go into a shoulder roll stumble forward and you come to a standing point however when you do you realize you rolled through a bunch of slick tar-like muck and the side of your jacket is now seeping with it there you go you feel balanced make a strength check you see trinket come up trinket goes into your necklace i would say the lighter half of the twins but i think they're an equal weight class you grab her by the side and (whoosh grunt) launch her into the air you catch your stomach contents make an acrobatics check you actually catch yourself on the side of the tree landing and then leap off of it with the last bit of momentum stepping gingerly on the tips of your feet you hear muffled clapping in the tree boughs ahead of you she's about 15 feet up (grunts) with a big long toss you make it most of the way over the water and begin to descend very close on the opposite side of the bank make an acrobatics check the good news is you miss the river the bad news is you warner brothers cartoon faceplant into the actual ground on the opposite side (laughter) tonight's episode of critical role not brought to you by ihop and probably never will be garmelie's on the side he goes don't worry you first once he's across our accord is complete no roll an attack well technically this is a grapple so it's an athletics check you reach out and his eyes go wide and he darts around and your fingers barely catch the edge of his fur and you get enough of a hold to lift him off the ground he's now dangling from your giant half-giant ass hand no i don't have to go there i'm just going back the other way when we're done make an athletics check your large bounding form (heavy footsteps impact scream) as you make it across you hit the other side the actual bank shifts and you guys feel the impact on the other side beneath your feet and there's a small crater in the ground where you landed and the river bank slowly fills it in as it lowers it just below river water level garmelie is now clutching your arm his hands and legs wrapped around your forearm (laughter) he looks past you and you all turn and look into the shademirk at this point you can see the bog itself is an endless dumping form of sludge into the gilded run the water itself is barely tearing it away what you guys noticed before the black oily material is itself thick ichor-like tar the smell that you're very familiar with that horrible acrid sulfurous scent is very thick in the area mixed with a terrible rotting leaf and decay you see bubbles going (bubbling) and churning up in certain parts of it and there are elements where you see knotted and gnarled roots that tangle up above the surface it is the most uninviting place in nature you've ever seen and experienced and you can see in the distance the swamp trees with high root sections overhead so you can walk underneath are scattered throughout ahead of you garmelie slowly turns his head back to you and goes no i'm all right but i appreciate that be careful don't stay in one place too long the longer you stand still the harder it gets to escape the place you stood and there's a lot of things that tend to live here from what i've heard that wait for stillness as a means of attack so keep moving i don't know it's time for me to go thank you guys so much i appreciate this it's been something a little kiss on the head and he goes well at least it's been a pleasure travelling with you my lady he takes your hand and does a little bow and (kiss) on the edge make an investigation check 23 as you feel down you feel this slight little bump inside of his fur and you're afraid to touch it for fear of it being-- on the outside of his body not that you understand the physicality of the satyr but still it's hard and smooth and appears to wiggle loosely when you touch it do you reach for it all right grasping onto it you tug and pull forth the small onyx mastiff that you had found earlier in the campground he goes oh that's right i was holding this for you fantastic well wish you all the best of luck stay alive i have my ways and he turns invisible you see little sludgy footprints go off down the shore and around the bend what do you want to do you cannot currently see him now he's already vanished it happens all right so what are you guys going to do this would be the tangleward tip of it the southern tip of the bog yes okay you step onto it and your foot descends about three inches before it comes to a stop (squelch) but as you go to remove your foot (sucking sound) it's very sticky effectively you guys are at half movement moving through the bog yeah it is a very thickly wooded swamp now the ground floor and the base of most of the trees and occasionally dripping from the top of the canopy itself is that black sludge-like material it's seemingly seeping from everything read out land's stride to me technically yes you can move at your normal pace the rest of the party still has to stay slowed you can try it's up to you okay as you guys get up onto the broom you release it from your grasp and it goes (splat) onto the ground both of you guys sink about three or four inches into the ground it lifts up and pulls you guys slowly out of the sludge (squelch) finally freeing yourself and you're now hovering a very short distance above the ground make a perception check right now technically it's swamp yeah not considered forest as you guys take a moment to look out in the distance you're unable to really make any idea of a form or movement keyleth you do see on the tree on the other bank it looks a little thicker towards the top than you expect and as you take a moment to glance you can see a rather large creature drop down from the canopy onto the ground and then slink behind it he's following you he shrinks sideways against the tree and is now barely visible other than his furry chest that's now peeking out one side of the width of the tree no reaction vax at this point is like so are we going to move on then let's do it make a stealth check guys 32 percy keyleth all right vex 32 pike and over here we have 12-foot-tall grog what did you roll you guys begin trudging forward into the shademirk everyone's being kind of and he's lumbering through it like a mammoth you all shush him and you find ways to cushion his footfalls as unstealthy as you may be in the moment the rest of the party helps try to keep you going forward the best they can being unheard you guys continue forward for about 30 minutes not really understanding the direction you know that heavy mountain that you saw on the way in is central and to the right of your direction and you're not entirely certain where the tree is here in the shademirk but you're keeping your eyes peeled and you continue to move forward further and further in it is difficult it is hot it is muggy there are heavy insects large winged bugs (buzzing) through the air and you knock them away the bubbling of the ground itself is releasing sulfurous gas and various other chemicals into the air that are probably not healthy to breathe extensively many of you are having to cover your mouth to keep from coughing to break up your stealth capabilities put your mask on okay make a perception check yes at this point it has now died down and your form has shifted to its normal form no as you guys move forward and vex is keeping watch vex you see ahead of you about 80 yards a large stocky tree in the distance that has a gentle glow emanating from the trunk it's hard to say at this distance you would have to get closer to get a better look about 80 yards a series of trees and a few low areas of open sludge it looks thicker than a lot of the other trees that you've seen in the area and there's a dull glow at the base of it trinket emerges (impact) in the sludge (moans) (grunts) and trinket manages to stalk forward make a stealth check for trinket without the plus ten because trinket was not around when you cast the spell his dexterity modifier nope he's not very stealthy that bear oh it was a six i thought you were joking all right trinket (squishy footsteps) you can hear the impact coming as each footfall hits the sludge as you get closer towards it keeping at bay as best out of sight as possible you see the tree while it is thicker it is not as high as the other trees in fact where there would be a top of a tree it looks to be instead a tangled mass of branches that have been matted over and tied down to the top of where this tree ends trinket stops you get a glance and the small glow is apparently a porthole or a window that is carved circular out from one side of the trunk of this tree the glow is a dull reddish-orange and it's flickering like firelight trinket backs up towards you (squish grunts) dives into the necklace it's like you're lagging all right what are you doing vex it seems to have an interior and some sort of warm firelight from the inside all right vex returns from out of the shadows of the forest no trinket in tow there are a number of trees in the vicinity yes where this thing is though there is about a 30-foot distance between it and any other trees it's in the center of a small clearing all right so as you ascend the side of the nearest tree and it resembles atreyu climbing up the tree in the swamp of sadness as it's these large gnarled branches and bits of muck and dust falling off the sides and the oil slick that is surrounding the base makes it difficult to find your handholds but you do eventually get your way up into the tree over the next five to ten minutes you were going to cast commune with nature you said all right what do you want to ask you're asking this of the tree or is this the land around you right you concentrate for a second you feel yourself link with the land and it's a very jarring sensation you're used to connecting with nature being this serene wonderful experience this is like plugging into a nightmare suddenly your thought process is filled with this ever-drawn sense of dread you feel this cold sensation fill your form and you manage to get this information across but it leaves this very hollow feeling in the center of your being feeling out you do not sense a cancerous tree but you do sense the strengthening presence of the source of this entire swamp's perpetual destitution and slow decay further to the northwest of this correct okay in feeling any source of bodies of water you're too far from the gilded run to sense any of that and there is no running water within the actual shademirk everything is a very slow-rolling sludge from the direction that you initially sensed it's this perpetual billowing of slow crawling death what little bit of running water you would sense is deep underground and probably still in danger over the next 50 years or so of being corrupted itself you need to be a little more specific than that (laughter) so you do a sense for large dangerous plant life entities like that crocodile as you extend your presence you get no images or any sense of creatures like that crocodile however you do sense a rather intense presence throughout this bog at certain places of other corrupted plant life entities no that's your final question the spell fades you climb your way back down out of the branches of the tree have the gnomes already been set on their path at this time yep so as you guys are having this discussion the broom slowly glides up to the outside of this tree as you get close to it you notice too from your immediate position that mass of dried roots and branches that are up top are threaded together with rope there is definitely construction to this almost like a wooden thatched roof the side porthole you see does have a wooden crossbeam in the center it is definitely a functional and pretty well-crafted window for this rather rough exterior the roots of the tree though it is not very tall it is thick it is round it's probably a good 25 30 feet wide this tree's trunk and the roots are large and sink deep into the ground in the vicinity you see the glow from the window what do you want to do one from what you can see what do you do okay make a perception check okay you don't pick up a lot of detail but as you come up over the top looking on the inside it looks to be rather comfortable surprisingly it's a small home there's a table and there's a small hearth there appears to be what looks to be a shelf of some kind ramshackle maybe but still functional with books pressed into it you can see a number of small baskets hanging from the ceiling containing various roots and other pieces of plant matter that are gathered and bundled together you can see there is a fireplace by the hearth there is also a series of drying animal carcasses hung in the corner that are all stripped and they're being aired out in that space you also see what looks to be a large chair that is facing the hearth slightly away from you and a small end table next to it that contains a little teacup and a little tea set actually the chair is pretty large it's tall the tea set is small and as you're making a look you see one large crooked hand reach out from behind the chair with impossibly long fingers with hooked nails reach over you can see what looks like dried wrappings hanging from parts of its wrist and elbow as it reaches over and wraps its gnarled fingers around this tiny teacup and pull it back behind the chair at this point you hear a snap sound and next to you you hear this (creak) as a little bit of light peeks out to your left a door has slowly opened on the side of the tree trunk flying where okay you guys turn and begin making your way back towards the party and the broom slows it comes to a stop and then drops out from under you both (squish) into the sludge all right and you're casting invisibility i believe that's what you do to get more of that making sure real fast so we don't mess this up you both turn invisible her clutching the broom you're both invisible now you're clutching the broom yeah you watch them vanish ahead of you a few moments pass and you guys end up making your way back to the group and you see the (squish) footfalls of both of your tiny gnome friends from your perspective you can't really see anything through the window you're just going off of what they've told you which has been very little you're looking into the side of the window and all you see is a little bit of flicker of firelight that's it clutching the broom in your hands as you emit the phrase that you've known to bring it to vibrant magical life (groaning) the broom jumps to life (cheering and laughter) and there backing up from this abode in the center of the shademirk bog your broom retrieved your party members gathered looking towards that glowing window and now the ajar door inviting you in to some degree we'll pick this up next session (cheering and applause) oh that's right
