off the mighty nein had made their way south absconding from the tensions of the north dwendalian empire to seek a few possible threads of mystery to the south shores and coasts of the menagerie coast you made your way through the wuyun gorge purchased a few pets and then eventually found yourselves-- for many of you your first time-- at the beach at the coast seeing an ocean seeing the waves seeing the sand and took a brief bit of time to relish in that experience eventually making your way to nicodranas in time for the sunset across the western ocean you began to notice the workforce that goes through the day and dwindles to the night that works alongside the numerous number of ships that come in and then stay along the wharf and the various docks in the vicinity you made your way through the-- not very stealthy but we're not in character yet so i'll allow it you made your way throughout various districts of the city eventually meeting the fantastic and long-presented mother of jester the ruby of the sea marion lavorre after having some time to catch up with her exchange information about your travels you discovered that there had been some issues with one client of hers in the town and managed to gather a little bit of information but began to seek more about this algar this figure who had grown jealous of other clientele and seemed to be becoming a point of concern for marion you took it upon yourselves to look into this individual and find a way to possibly resolve this while you were in town you also began to run into some other curious mysteries you went to the lighthouse and spoke with the lighthouse keeper there for a bit you had found a strange tower in the open quay (laughs) then eventually discovered along the wharf a tavern with a familiar name based on some of the previous things you were keeping an eye out for the wayfarer's cove you had just stepped into the darkened interior of this the smell of old wet wood combined with the dried liquors and ales that had long stained the various tables and floorboards of this dank and relatively musty bar looking across the clientele a few interesting persons caught your attention and that's where we left off so mighty nein as you begin to enter this darkened torch-lit interior-- lantern i would say slowly hanging from various portions of the ceiling crossbeams the bits of wind that push them causing them to slightly shift and have this shifting crackle of firelight within the chamber what do you wish to do do you walk up and approach him sitting there on the table both these large scaled coming to the point of these hooked claws these hands are wrapped around this heavy tankard the head shifts over your direction where the eye patch meets your gaze first before the other eye creeps past the extending hard brow i'm sorry what you asking eh well t-that's certainly a possibility cher you don't think that perhaps someone's going to tell you their life story just without even knowing you you can buy me a drink first very well (sighs) he raises one of his fingers up towards the bar and the bartender glances up oh another round okay he turns around and begins preparing what looks to be another drink lowers his hand and claw which scrapes across the wood and leaves this little curl of-- little shaving that is put to the side as his hand comes to rest looking back at you with his one eye how about this then let's trade a story huh y-you tell me where you're from and why it brought you in to my table then m-maybe i'll tell you how i lost this yeah (laughs) no drink gets brought down to the table don't worry she's going to take care of it it's a silver for that so it's an easy trade off okay well for a round of drinks and the milks involved as well that'll put you we'll say at about two silver i'm going to be perfectly honest that was a lot m-more than i was asking but i appreciate it he turns and you hear the creaking of leather as the long extended neck turns the folds of skin pushing against themselves oh this got this here on sea maybe about six or seven years ago he reaches back and you can see-- it's interesting because on the right side of the shell it looks like elements have been carved through where these pipes have been put in on the back on the front there's a small deflated pouch of leather and a small extended tube of metal he lifts it with one hand and breathes into it and it inflates a bit and inflates a bit you see his one eye look around mischievously to everyone else at the bar and goes i mean y-you asked (terrible bagpipe wails) this trio of bagpipes begin blasting out of these large almost shell-sculpted pipes that curve out of his shell and everyone in the room just immediately starts grabbing their ears going ah and start throwing things over clanking off of his shell only a few notes in because while he's mischievously enjoying the moment of shattering the calm and chill in the chamber he's not going to get himself thrown out so he stops and goes that there's how i keep the other shipmates entertained it's been a number of m-m-months since i found me a good ship and a purpose out there on the ocean sea but i've been known to be a rather decent second mate and navigator that's not my m-m-moniker (laughter) orly orly skiffback skiffback now i've been forthcoming in my d-direct title m-m-might i ask what your individual names may be very well welcome to this shithole he grabs his drink and sips takes a few moments and looks around again y'all still lingering for some reason can't say that i have there son my apologies however you're m-m-more than welcome to ask around i'm sure there's a whole mighty spectrum of curious travelers that come in and out of here more the latter than the former i got to jive with the right crew more like they got to jive with me i mean-- and he does this i'm-a-fucking-tortle physicality to it well they're an acquired taste i'd say perhaps cherie yeah i'd say so why you asking if i m-might inquire make a persuasion check i can say i've seen him around occasionally the boy has needed a place to crash and i've provided my shack my abode when he's been drinking too hard or comes in with some sort of a m-mark on his face only in occasionally n-not in a few days no don't pay attention don't care none you see him getting guarded the more you start asking about marius a little bit caduceus you specifically as you're watching this you get the sense that he's offered up a little bit of information but that little bit seems to have caused him to reel in he's being guarded and doesn't seem very forthcoming though he passes it off as a lack of information you said something about a delivery there's a shifting to orly at which point the last of the air in the small pouch gets pushed in and it (wailing bagpipes) slowly comes to rest (laughs) m-m-marius ain't really what you'd call sea-trekking folk more of a slimy shadow word peddler however last time i saw him not but maybe a week ago i recall he was complaining waiting on something to be delivered never found its way around was getting real-- that boy owes a lot of money make a persuasion check yeah 21 orly looks you straight with his one good eye glances up and down you get a good look the leather eye patch itself has its own carving into it like it was wettened at one point and then shaved to have a very similar pattern as the curling wave tattoos that match his upper arms and you can now see the backs and sides of his neck looking through you for a moment goes-- let me tell you something if what you say is true it could very well be that you and your friends here might have a way of taking some of the weight off of m-m-marius i haven't seen him in some time but i do know sometimes he hangs around the docks at night round m-m-midnight sometimes he's meeting folks in ships and selling things i can only imagine is illegal sometimes he's picking things up what you looking for skinny-ass little half-elf fellow sides of his head shaved real low tiny little fuzz with a big old flop of blonde hair hangs around in front of the face other than that he don't dress m-m-mighty rich or anything tends to stay out of sight so maybe be best you keep a keen eye around the shadows huh if all goes well and you end up doing him a solid don't be afraid to tell him that orly put you in the right direction huh if not don't say a fucking word scratches the bottom of the chin looking at you yeah there's an older fisherman-looking gentleman who's sitting there minding his own business staring at his own drink though now he's glaring over this large group that's conversing after blowing bagpipes in the middle of his previously solitary afternoon there's a woman probably late 40s early 50s or so with a very big mass of hair that goes from a dark brown to a gray to white at the tips almost like a mane dark skin looks weathered from lots of travel and probably seen quite a bit in her day a light brown coat that hangs over the edge of the chair she's sitting in they're all looking at you guys because you all come storming in here cause this ruckus talking to the tortle yeah you guys aren't the most subtle of arrivals make an insight check hard to tell do you guys stay with orly or-- he looks like he is enjoying his drink and he's not giving you any particular vibe in your direction he doesn't seem to mind but he's not engaging most of his conversation is reactive at the moment what are you talking about i don't either my apologies i don't know make an insight check he's smiling with his response and in all your time you're not very well versed in the tics and the subtle facial reads for tortles oh that's fine there are all sorts of problems throughout this city you end up taking one down that's one m-m-more that we don't got to piss on well that just ain't going to stand now is it cherie you got to respect people's m-m-mamas while you're having this conversation fjord has walked over to the other table and the woman sitting there her hands resting on the side trailing as well as you guys approach with fjord towards the front she watches you well i'm going to be honest it's hard not to draw my attention with that very subtle display you've all managed to provide this here wine it's wine red why you buying (chuckle) i'll always care for more for just her or for both of you okay that'll put you back we'll say-- no we'll say one silver for just her for one round to be completely honest i don't spend a lot of time in the quay i tend to focus more on this side the business is better i don't know why i'm focused on that other eye i'm stuck in that i just noticed that no it's good she was leaning this way i know and it's a problem already she goes i've seen it i've certainly gazed and seen that weird tower i think that's what you're referring to oh no just passing through taking a break i've only been here for about a week and then shoving off back to this trade route towards marquet probably you a sailor as well what's your specialty i might be looking for crew what's your rank but you're looking to travel i maybe got room for one more in the crew if you want to come along prove yourself a few days at sea she glances off to the side and points on the far left side of the harbor i can't really show you from here follow me she steps up and walks past you towards the front and points to one ship past there the one with the grayish sails furled up that's the drensala vis that's my ship she's been through a lot but she's stuck with me for many years i didn't catch yours who is this guy this your friend i've got to say i'm pretty intrigued by a strong-backed small-ranked sailor looking for work that walks around with his own accountant caleb widogast fjord just fjord well i'm just captain adella pleasure to meet you i think when we round up with a full crew and supplies gathered up probably want to take some time to relax here in town for another week or so and then we'll head off it's probably going to be a good six seven months' journey before we come back but if you and your accountant friend are looking to come we got room for two more if you want to pay passage yeah direct couple stops along the coast but-- very well you as well that's about as much as i've heard i tend not to poke around places that act weird strange magics and such lot of folks that get too curious end up not coming back she goes not in my crew yeah half-elf fella yeah he was in here a few months back when i was last docked in nicodranas working with that lowlife cadmus haven't seen him since though cadmus leeland you know cadmus leeland he's a right fuckface i'll tell you that yeah make a history check you have heard of cadmus cadmus goes under the guise of a shipping merchant that hops from port to port but for those who work heavily in the shipping lanes he's known to be a thief one that skims off the top recently his business has come to a crawl as he's instead been staying out to sea possibly from what rumors have said been involved in the shaking down of ships without means of protecting themselves you also with that roll you know the name of his ship the widow's embrace not in your readings no you haven't spent a lot of time studying maritime history i don't think you have why what's this sabian to you all right but i'd do my best to stay away from cadmus the guy's a right asshole if your friend's palling around with him i don't know what kind of shit your friend's getting into these days at this point captain adella looks over your shoulder a bit and goes anyway i'm going to go finish my wine it's been a pleasure you guys have moved back into the bar and in the doorway you see a figure appear a looming figure there's the dark silhouette against the bright sun in the sky behind you see over one shoulder some sort of large sack that has been thrown over and held with one arm the other sits at the side with a sword sheathed across that shoulder stepping into the light you see the familiar and somewhat surprised face of yasha ashley if you want to jump in here if you don't mind you guys spin around to see the broad shoulders and intimidating presence of yasha step into the dark bar interior yasha you step inside looking for a moment of respite and a drink and are caught off guard by the group that is now staring back at you with the same aghast expression the bartender goes and gathers a couple bottles of wine that'll run you-- fair or fine wine that'll be for two bottles 20 gold for a passing somewhat briny wine run you about two gold for two bottles you have no idea who that is you see this bright crimson weasel that is now curled up in your hand and (chattering) it pisses right in your hand as you say dog you look down and you can see the right side of your boot is now being slightly moistened by the urine of the tiny puppy all the animals are apparently marking you as their territory but you see this tiny light brown puppy with big oversized paws and a couple of faint stripes across the fur these pointy fey-featured elements more angular than a softer puppy should and these eyes look up at you (panting) the somewhat portly half-elf greets you as you approach again all right would you like another drink oh why wait it's good to have a backup right all right very well i'm sorry what the big blue tower over in the quay yeah i know of it yeah why why do you ask yeah it's got some weird sort of illusion magic to it it's creepy belongs to some mage he's been here for a while named yussa a mystery to me i don't fucking go and start climbing up towers to ask questions where they don't belong that's um-- same or-- he goes and prepares-- looking at this would you prefer a pitcher thinking back you had received these words but not having a lot of experience with this type of spell contact before you weren't sure if it was you imagining things or having a slight nervous breakdown everyone curls over the chair falls over it finds its way to the ground there's a pause as everyone looks around there's a continued pause as they all look around doing a pass across everybody in this room with a discerning eye especially with your passive insight you get the sense that nobody here really knows this algar figure the lavish chateau orly is clapping with his giant mitt-like clawed tortle hands not too bad (laughter) that's what you were told from the light keeper at the lighthouse she said as far as she knew the entrances that she knows of are beneath the docks where the land falls off and meets the ocean and the docks are out there it's somewhere underwater there all right you're not that far away thankfully you've been hanging around the restless wharf for a while which is where the tavern was striking out towards the edge and looking across the docks there's one large ship that came in and looks like a lot of stuff is being unloaded and is busy on that end not that far off of it the next dock that shoots out and turns to the right there looks like there's a couple of anchored ships there it's a little less busy looks like they're currently moored there and not a lot of folks are doing business on or around the ships other than just keeping a watch on the docks themselves make a perception check you don't see anything in the way of a ship shack right now you do see a man an older grizzled fisherman of some kind or at least a dock worker he has this long cap on that dangles past his mid-shoulders in a heavy dark gray cloth shirt that is drenched with sweat like he's been doing hard work throughout most of the day you see him currently tying a small rowboat to the edge there and holding it in place oh yeah this here is my boat what's your name sir fjord jimmy pleasure to meet you you much of a shipman yourself we'll say because you have a sailor's background at this point you guys converse back and forth a bit you swap some stories with him about how he used to be a dockworker and some of the ships he was on back in the day yeah about five minutes of back and forth you get to the point where you're both laughing and feel comfy eventually he goes don't even worry about the money just i'll keep an eye on out here and don't take it too far out in the bay when you're done bring it back least i could do he goes ahead and helps untie the boat you have it at your disposal you can certainly try comfortably it can fit four people uncomfortably it could fit you all space-wise you're uncertain as to the ship's ability to hold the load yeah yeah it doesn't change his weight but-- yeah volumetrically it wouldn't make that much of a difference for you fjord just disappears beneath the surface she pointed a basic direction but there was no visual guide to it you come out dripping the water slowly pouring out from under your armor i've heard of that but i don't really know much about that sorry good luck though yeah there's a handful of other people that are in the process of-- largely on the other side where that bigger ship is that's being currently unloaded or loaded into-- you can't tell from this distance zolezzo there are you can see two zolezzo that are just patrolling the docks ten minutes make a general insight check to try and gauge which of them is the most insecure that's not bad at all all right you look and of the two that are there one of them seems to be pretty preoccupied with the ships that are being loaded and one of them appears to be half-present probably in mid-daydream yawning at his post and looks younger than the other one between the two of them he's probably the most insecure if you had to decide i'm sorry can i help you i'm sorry i am working at the moment-- you can see his eyes roll and he goes what can i do to help you then he sighs heavily and reaches out and finally takes the hand he goes hello i am zolezzo merpol make a persuasion check 14 he goes oh that is a very specific curiosity well the sluice weave is a series of tunnels that were installed probably a century ago that are responsible for-- they are ducts that guide water from the ocean to a series of small engines in the city that help propel the furnaces that the various businesses and locations here that require that sort of intense power to utilize it's also-- well not haunted per se but there are-- he goes not haunted but there are elements to it-- he's like (uncomfortable laugh) (laughter) (sheepishly) i mean there's been-- you know about a year ago they had this one ship that came into the-- there were these thieves-- and i happened to be on job at the moment and so-- yeah i haven't been down in the sluice area there the entrance as far as i know is mostly hidden the one inside the city somewhere i don't know yeah there's two or three i think that are right down off the side-- here come here and he leads you over (laughs) he leads you over across the dock for a bit and he points down in the water and goes i think somewhere in this vicinity there is sort of the intake tube or pipe where the ocean water is brought in to the sluice ducts make a perception check perception yes from this distance it's too hard to see beneath the water it gets a little too murky but he points in a general direction and you get a loose idea of where it may be he's like so what are you up to while you're in the city (laughter) of course where are you staying oh wow that is a very expensive place you can see the visible (pained grunt) to his chest he's like well perhaps i'll-- if you want other things to see around the city when i'm not on my post i could maybe come by and give you a little tour of course what are you doing right now i only have about 40 minutes until i get to switch my shift and then i'm off for the rest of the afternoon he looks a bit flabbergasted see you later what was it what was the name tracy he sits there for a second and goes tracy-- yeah merpol (laughs) merpol yeah no different name he thinks to himself tracy and continues the rest of his post along the dockside so what are you doing into a-- ooh as you guys all begin to gather into the boat the two of you i think you said you're staying off to the side jester and fjord yeah there's extra rope available so you guys swim beneath as it continues off through the water okay we'll find out roll a stealth check plus everyone but fjord sees you (laughter) you guys begin to row over in that direction who all is keeping an eye in the water all right go ahead and make a perception check please sure so go ahead and take advantage on that between you and frumpkin okay glancing through the water you watch as one of the sun rays definitely hits a clear patch of the ocean below you and you see a brief glimmer of what looks to be a either metal or stone piece that is different from the rest of the natural slightly eroded rock you see a circle maybe a four- or five-foot-wide opening that's about 40 feet down all righty okay so there is a circular pipe entrance or a tunnel entrance 40 feet down right as the water gets darker and more murky bits of clustered seaweed begin to come up and tickle the bottoms of frumpkin's tentacles in that vicinity elements of it are blocking the front but you can clearly see there is a dark tunnel that continues into the earth beneath the city beneath the docks you don't know how far it goes necessarily make a perception check you do not see anything alive or moving in this vicinity best you can see the tunnel continues in for about 15 or so feet and there is a metal grate you can see eight or so bars across actually about ten bars about an inch thick each and they're horizontal though it's a little bit tilted to one side with eight of them and it's about four and a half five feet across sorry ten across it would be about six inches between each yeah your octopus could all right oh the bars there isn't a lot of rust as much as there is a lot of barnacles and other natural sediment that is gathered on edges of it you can still see the metal you can see a little bit of rust here and there looks like more natural elements seem to have crusted and clustered around parts of it okay about-- let's see here about 60 or so feet into the tunnel it curves upward yeah all right about 30 or so feet up the water breaks there's a surface though there is no light does frumpkin's octopus form have darkvision yes okay so does frumpkin-- okay frumpkin floats there on top for a second and you can see now where it emerges-- there is another set of bars right at the top of that tunnel that frumpkin has pushed and squeezed through to come through so there's bars like a grate on the way in and then a grate once you curve upward into the tunnel come through a second set and then breaks the surface of the water about a foot beyond that and now you can see it is closed off mostly except for a tunnel that continues deeper in the same direction that the lower tunnel went and that one continues on for a bit there is no air between the water and the grate yeah it's all water up and then there's the grate and then it turns into this tunnel that continues inward and there's about a foot of water beyond that and then there's air from that point make an investigation check for frumpkin 14 you can still mutter the incantation underwater yeah in the process of casting a spell if you're holding your breath that's your breath that's the way to do it looking there is no locking mechanism the grate isn't one that opens and closes it's not a door it's just in place another investigation check perception check 17 you see a number of fish swirling through the various bits of kelp and seaweed that are pushing up from the bottom of the bay below it's beautiful you can see the colors and glistening bits of silver as the fish curl through the sunlight but nothing catches your attention as dangerous in your immediate vicinity thankfully make a perception check sam and what did you roll okay you look out and people seem to be working on the dock and you know okay so you're sending him further in the tunnel goes on for about another 60 or so feet beyond that grate before the tunnel opens up into a square-like chamber with a singular pillar that marks the center of it it's still one foot of water all throughout this entire area once you go past this-- you can look past where this pillar is the chamber seems to close off and another tunnel continues on almost like this is just a waypoint chamber on the right side you see a much smaller grate maybe a foot and a half two feet across with a more dense cross-lattice of bars frumpkin's size how big of an octopus is frumpkin an octopus i'd say it would be about that big but octopuses can squeeze through some pretty small spaces yeah so i'd say make an athletics check for tiny octopus frumpkin frumpkin gets partially through but the nature of the lattice and frumpkin's unfamiliarity with the octopus form reaches a point where it can't quite get all the way through looks like basic stonework it has a slight curvature to it but it's probably placed in here either as a load bearing piece since this is beneath a heavier city or-- it doesn't look remarkable or have any other purpose beyond just being a support pillar the water only goes up to a foot and then it's air for the rest of it it's about ten or so feet tall the chamber make a perception check no guys no better adventure then having all your friends sit back and send your tiny friend yeah exactly no i know so 17 looking around the water and it's salt water it's all ocean water coming in here occasionally you see slight waves little ripples from different directions make an intelligence check yeah it's probably a little over 100 feet beyond where you are now though you are probably in the boat about 15 or 20 feet back so it's about 125 130 feet which you couldn't-- because it's 100 foot range for to-- to pull him back yeah okay cool so you are fine best you can tell over there it looks like some sort of warehouse it's a larger storage building it's not remarkable in its design or decor the tentacles wrap over the shoulders and underneath the puppy is in the boat like (panting barks) the three of you dive down which one of you has the lead line who has the other end of it fjord has it you guys all dive down taking a breath pushing through the seaweed until eventually you come to the base of where that tube is a few feet into it you see the grate and it's about roughly four and a half five-foot diameter so you have to crouch down but you can get a hold on this all right one of you roll with advantage or you both roll independently 20 right but 20 total that's the dc you needed yeah so you both are holding on and pulling you get your foot in some of the imperfect stonework where elements of the masonry pokes out which gives you a foot groove and one part where some of the stone had been rotted away and that's just enough of a point to lock yourself in as you pull you feel (shifting) and eventually it comes out of its mooring on the wall and then slides off to the side you rotate it a bit and it comes to rest in the middle of it so you guys go ahead and come back onto it again well you guys all have pretty high constitutions so not really it works out just so you guys know your constitution modifier is how many minutes you can hold your breath underwater actually technically it's one plus your constitution modifier so it's even more the rope you found here it's probably 60 to 70 feet at most all right you do that you guys all jump back in a second time you dive back down below pushing through the darker depths of the bay eventually finding yourselves back to the tunnel where the grate has been shifted to the side so now you have at an angle underneath you can swim over or under it you guys pincer off of it taking two different directions and meeting on the opposite side you go a few more lengths before the tunnel shifts upward you both have darkvision if i recall good because there was no light source in the water beyond just the distant glow and shifting of the sunlight through the water you make your way back up and you find the grate above you this area the footholds aren't as easy because it's not quite as close to the elements so the dc's a little higher but if you guys grab hold you can go ahead and make a check that with your modifier is a 23 23 okay you both hold on this time you're having a hard time getting any sort of a foothold into the space jester you angrily look down and taking your elbow you jam a section of the stone until it breaks off and you find a section of-- noticing this yasha you do the same and smash you guys actually break a few footholds into the side of this tunnel once you're set into place you look at each other count to the right moment and pull i mean you've seen jester do some cool stuff but in that moment it's a rosie riveter-- muscle moment-- as guns going the metal bars bend slightly (metal creak) from underneath the water you hear the echo and then it comes loose from the mooring and begins sinking down towards both of you the heavy metal is now sandwiching you guys towards the bottom and you push off and manage to get it to rotate and you swim around it without having an issue yep you guys make it to the surface (splash) (sharp inhale) and you're now inside the tunnel it's strangely-- okay you guys watch as fjord breaks the surface without the other two all right i would like you to make a wisdom saving throw nott please your fear subside momentarily and you find yourself instinctually nodding as you know what maybe trying it once and seeing how it goes is exactly what caleb would want (splash) going under water you hear the-- the diminishing squeak as it slowly vanishes beneath the surface caduceus and caleb sitting up in the ship with a weasel and a puppy so as beau swims-- now beau go ahead and make an athletics check for me because you are technically carrying two passengers it's a little cocked yeah that counts no if you can rest a d4 on it yeah strongly pushing through using the grate to go ahead and pull yourself forward beneath the surface you bring your goggles down so you can actually see where you're going once the light begins to subside you still hear in the water above you (squeal) oh you don't even know you know nothing about it you're just like i got this swing upward break the surface (inhale) come up from the top and there you can see yasha and jester waiting for you they are stepped up into the tube you hear (coughing up water) you look down as this waterlogged weasel is now like coughing and sneezing it's awake and conscious you're just pushing on its chest it's just sitting in the boat looks over the edge (whining) make a persuasion check actually this would be animal handling yeah in your robes there's a comfortable little cradle that you form there and then (puppy whining) (poof) and then appears into the small pocket in your arm perception check looking around no one in particular seems to be paying much mind to what your business is i will ask you to make an athletics check because you are swimming mostly with one arm and your legs as you are cradling the puppy with the other (exertion noises) you make your way partway through the tunnel and under the grate you get past that point look up you push off you're tired your lungs are starting to hurt from just the amount of effort it's taking to go this distance with one arm and your legs kicking you've waded in the ponds near the graveyard-- you're not a practiced swimmer correct the puppy though-- not yet no make another athletics check-- okay yeah you get down low to the bottom of it and push upward right at that moment you see this little burst of bubble (poof) in your arm just as you're about to break the surface you look down frightened and he's not there and as you look up break the surface (inhale) come up and you watch as (poof) in the air-- marisha and you catch nugget (panting) just waterlogged dripping the weasel looks miserable sprinkle is just like (snarling) he curls up in there you're all clustered up in this small tunnel it's maybe eight feet across and it's cylindrical in its shape about a foot and a half of water depending upon where you're standing in it and it continues down dark into the next chamber do you point out the grate to them as you guys have moved through the tunnel into the small chamber break in the tunnel path there with the pillar caleb points over to the grate and you can see it's a pretty dense lattice of metal yeah you can get your fingers in there's enough space there to get your fingers in more each bar is about two inches apart from each other sure go ahead and make another strength check the beast team here (exertion noise) you get the sense-- first off your fingers are sore and your arms are strained from the two previous exerts that you've given and you've done impressive things but you get the sense that this is probably-- because it's smaller it's wedged into a little tighter in the small tunnel the actual tunnel there is maybe about a foot across a foot and a half across most of you would not even fit through it but you're unable to get it to budge at all make a perception check looking around it resembles a subterranean sewer it's mostly just stone and masonry that's slick from the moisture and the air itself is very humid down here there is a lot of moisture that gathers across the stone and there's streaks of color and minerals that have gathered on the walls over time you still have the taste of the brine in your mouth from your time under the ocean but the air in here is still also very ocean-like and salty make an investigation check looking at it there are certain markers and the levels that say that there have at times been different levels of water in here but it doesn't seem often enough like certain levels of minerals and sediment that you can see but a lot of them seem older and haven't been reached in a while you're looking for writing you don't see any writing make a perception check good to you in the past but not tonight apparently yeah looking around you don't see any markings in the stonework but as you go across the pillar in the center looking for any sort of details you hear this faint-- almost like the sound of a crashing wave and the rushing of water and you glance around the edge and in the corner you can see the water that previously was just moving from your breaking the surface moving through has started to-- (fwoosh) almost like it's forming a small occasional whirlpool and then comes to rest for a moment and then-- no yeah okay frumpkin-- the tunnel okay frumpkin has appeared on the other side while this is happening you watch as the small whirlpool begins to gather up and rise above the surface in what is a roughly basketball-sized swirl of water like an inverse whirlpool a second one begins to emerge from the water behind you they're essentially looking at reverse whirlpools that are rising up out of the water coming to a point as the water seems to be almost guiding itself okay roll for attack roll for an attack yep both of them hit go ahead and roll damage before she even says that roll some damage because this is all happening very quickly quick let me check one thing real fast no okay so good to know so it was nine and-- okay got you you watch as both enter the water and it seems to react pull back and a spray of water hits the wall behind it you watch as it quivers and then suddenly you see these two large pseudopods of water somehow emerge from it and you see for a moment this angry face (snarling) in the water towards you as both of them begin to rush in towards you in the center of the chamber and we're going to start with rolling initiative when we return so for our giveaway at the break to remind you guys we've had to make some changes so you need to enter in the

announced when we return here in a few minutes so see you guys here in a few minutes [break] all right friends so last we left off i need you all to roll initiative all right so 25 to 20 all right so it's beau anyone else 25 to 20 20 to 15 18 there you go 16 all right 15 to ten nott what did you get and then taking up the rear there we go that's all right so first round of battle up first you watch as these two emerging whirlpools begin to form into these amorphous angry spinning and intense-looking tiny water spouts with bashing pseudopods that swing out and attempt to make some sort of heavy impact with anybody who's nearby they seem strangely sentient as opposed to being some sort of manifested trap however with that first initial attack from beau that's the first surprise round we'll be going into combat at the top of it it is beau once again so what are you doing are you running up to attack all right all right so you go ahead and swing and-- 15 hits all right this is with your-- with your staff as well okay you notice the first impacts of the shurikens that you had thrown seem to pass through the water with some impact but not heavily and the second staff hit that strikes seems to not be as impactful against the wood or maybe against the water form of this creature go for it nine misses so with your bonus action just swings wide these things are small but nimble and they keep-- their form seems to constantly be shifting and changing position it's like fighting a miniature squall in the middle of it so you're like ah no impact that ends your turn all righty next up jester you're up it is there is no light source in here so caleb starts hearing all these noises in his-- oh that's right because you do have dark vision so yeah right now guys-- where do you want it to go actually no firbolgs can't so caduceus is the only one in pitch black all right here you got it technically you'd have to move to have line of sight on where it was dropped so you'd have to shift there you go so moving up next to yasha you watch as the spiritual weapon flash happens 14 hits (cheering) nice while the impacts of beau's strikes with the staff and the shurikens weren't doing a whole lot it seemed damaging but not anything as hardy as you were hoping the spiritual weapon comes down and seems to cleave it in half as it separates and reforms itself you hear this splashing and swishing of water it sounds almost like a lowered angry growl all right go ahead and roll oh that's its roll it's a-- wisdom save that is a natural four so go for it damage good round you watch as the impact of the cantrip strikes it and the water seems to shake itself around for a moment shifting as the sound vibrations are forcing it to coast in a strange design in its space that ends your turn all right that brings us to fjord as you're pushing through you're seeing certain things that are sunken in the water in the corners looks like bits of materials that have either washed in through the water broken crates and bits of wood things that gather in the edges you push past them with your feet as you make it there the one that appeared behind the rest go for it 13 just hits 12 misses so roll damage on the first strike five points of damage the eldritch blast hits it and you watch as it creates this circle in the center of its elemental form as it impacts and actually strikes the stone behind with whatever residual energy from the original impact the hole forms up it took damage it didn't seem to be as resistant as it had to previous blows magic seems to cut through whatever defense it has that ends fjord's it's now their turn this one who currently is engaged directly with you is going to wisp around into the water and emerge on the other side of beau and is going to go ahead and attempt to whirlpool strike you i need you to make a strength saving throw please as it emerges you feel the water beneath you begin to whip into a torrent and you are swept off of your feet and knocked prone and are considered currently restrained as it moves into your space it's now currently swirling around you and you're having a hard time moving it's now forcing water into your mouth you can't breathe in the moment you are whelmed by the elemental so that ends its turn the one over here is going to go ahead because it's closest to caduceus it's just going to shift up into your space get in contact with both you and caleb and it's going to attempt to whelm you as well i need you to go ahead-- it can only target one person-- but i need you to make a strength saving throw for me caduceus 17 that's a success you feel the same water swirling around your legs and you manage to pull back and wrench your legs free as the torrent comes to a slow crawl once more and the creature's form emerges you can see the water now forming these two large sledgehammer-like fists that hang at its somewhat four four-and-a-half-foot tall torso that's going to end both of their turns caduceus you're up not very well as soon as you can see an enemy you will release your sacred flame okay so you can hear it and the focus of this swirling splashing sound all right so caduceus side-steps caleb you're up all right so you move this way okay it's going to go ahead and take a swipe at you with a slam attack that is a 22 to hit you suffer-- oh wow that is 12 points of bludgeoning damage you get slammed in the lower back the hip area and almost spin from the blow of it but continue to stumble forward over to the position you wanted to be all right still restrained correct all right so that is about as far as you can get right there because fjord is currently in the far corner and i'm marking you with concentration just so i can keep tabs on that all right so that ends caleb's go nott you're up go for it that hits mhmm all right 17 points of damage on him nice because it is magical it bypasses the defenses you watch as the bolt hits and there's a spark as it impacts and for a second it seems to almost lose its corporeal form then flickers back in the bolt sinks down into the water below beneath the knee-level of the liquid that seems to consume the entire chamber which as a note guys those who have been moving around i should mention it i've been keeping tabs under my own right moving through this is considered difficult terrain because you are about knee- to thigh-high in water and you're having to basically wade through as you go except for nott who's standing above it technically the mariner's armor would give you a swim speed so you can move through it at your regular speed so you don't have to worry about it that is correct here you'll probably have to move a little farther back to break sight from one of these enemies but go ahead okay okay good to know gotcha yeah that's just an action you're not quite-- no you would've had to have been to go through if you weren't affected by a suggestion spell you're on the verge like you're tipsy but you're not drunk all right that finishes your go yasha you're up you've seen beau suddenly grown to a larger size but still being swarmed by the water of this elemental form all righty you can try you can certainly try so you move up adjacent to beau and the one creature and what are you going to do are you going to attempt and pull her out okay so you use your action i need you to go ahead and make a strength check you have advantage because you are raging eight you go and grab and try to pull her but unfortunately the water and sediment in here has given a slick surface to the floor as you pull your feet keep skidding across the floor you can't get any sort of purchase and you can't pull her out unfortunately yeah you rolled was that not with advantage roll again okay hold on you've been rolling the wrong number of dice oh well good to know (laughter) so beau you are still in this space a little bit-- you're still in the space of the creature but you've managed to be pulled free from it so you're still prone but you are not currently whelmed by it all right that ends yasha's go unless you want to move you pull your sword out of the wall and get ready for the next round of combat this brings us to the top of the round beau you're up jester you're next yeah yeah make-- yeah you can which as you do it's a spray and spin windmill of water in the air around it go ahead and make your attacks both hit nine points of damage to it from the spinning kick landing on the ground you are now just barely mid-calf in water but it's also about ten feet tall in here so you're having to hunch a little bit your head actually hits the ceiling a bit you're like (groaning) okay i don't think you can spend a ki point to do that it's just an ability you get to use yes immunities vulnerabilities okay its constitution saving throw is a plus three it's not technically a vulnerability but you do see that if it takes cold damage it partially freezes which reduces its speed okay so the first one does hit second one misses ten damage very good so with that as you're standing there you go ahead and swing one fist down and it strikes right at the center of it and you watch as it separates for a second as it reforms you go for another strike and this time it manages to duck just out of the way seeing the precursor of that strike and it dodges entirely that finishes your turn all right that brings us to jester all right that hits go ahead and roll damage go for it i'll allow it so you roll an attack roll so a spell attack roll ranged spell attack roll that's cocked yeah that hits go ahead and roll damage for your guiding bolt 15 points of radiant damage to it in the middle of this darkness there's this flash of light and this streaking beam of radiant energy that strikes and blasts into the elemental caduceus in that one moment your eyes suddenly focus in on the glowing form almost in slow motion as this elemental is slowly bursting from the radiant energy and you see that moment all right so that's a wisdom saving throw dex saving throw that is a 14 it fails all right it'll take the damage on that one they're both looking a little hurt and a little aggressive they're now starting to get a little frenzied that ends your turn jester actually-- yes because that wasn't an attack roll fjord you're up okay yeah she used guiding bolt there you go correct so 2d8-- four so eight plus whatever the modifier is or it's just 2d8 right booming blade is still an attack eight points of damage (impact noise) it is currently encircled by the booming energy all righty that ends your turn fjord all righty it's now their turn so this one here now low on health and a bit frenzied is going to go ahead and take two strikes at the enlarged beauregard that has been its issue at this time that's going to be a 21 to hit and a 22 to hit 15 and 16 naturally oh my god sam it's 18 points of bludgeoning damage to you beauregard for its being so small the short bursts of impact it seems that in its harrowed state it's lashing out with all that it can the other one is going to go ahead and attempt to make a strike at fjord and a strike at caduceus the one against fjord is a natural one it goes to swing out towards you and you hold the blade up and you watch as it actually splits its extruding watery arm across the blade it divides then splashes into-- yeah falls harmlessly onto the ground and it has to reform a new pseudopod the other arm swings back towards caduceus that's going to be a 13 to hit you pull up your shield and deflect it off to the side no major issue there that finishes their go-- actually no this guy's going to go ahead and move this one's going to go ahead and shift over towards-- jester is becoming a problem caduceus you do have an attack of opportunity if you want to take one correct yes correct sam liam and no worry there then that does not hit that brings us to caduceus's turn you're up you're still blind you should it's a barrel you played diablo you know how this works ting you got it finishing caduceus's turn caleb you're up all righty he's a very prominent sorcerer or wizard 23 does hit nine points of acid damage to it as the acid arrow strikes and impacts on its form there's this splash of acidic liquid that actually should-- i believe beau also has to make yeah it does take lesser damage from the acid but it didn't have a lot of hit points left so the impact is lessened however let me double-check here for the acid arrow no sorry that's older systems yeah no that doesn't matter older systems would do splash acid damage but not in this one so yeah you manage to pull out of the way as it falls back and dissolves amongst the rest of it a little bit of sea foam left behind in its wake all right finishing caleb's turn nott you're up it is engaged with jester yes 17 as that one impacts you see it reaching out with both of its fists towards jester as it strikes her its midsection just turns into bits of foam and sea water as it splashes against her armor and shield as you glance around keeping an eye out make an investigation check feeling through the floor and finding your space in here you do not find any grates or any other exits beyond the tunnel ahead of you the tunnel you came from and the small grate on the side but it's high enough where the water doesn't actually meet that level yet but you do see the trailing signs of runoff and various bits of minerals that have gathered and dripped out over time to cause some discoloration to the stone okay as frumpkin pulls his way through the tunnel slowly the tentacles unfurling and dragging him forward through this slick somewhat slimy algae grooved tube it goes on for about a good 150 feet before it meets another grate all right so you can't watch at this distance oh you can view but you cannot give actions so frumpkin comes to this next grate go ahead and make a strength check for frumpkin it's a three frumpkin is unable to push past that secondary grate and fighting with it for a bit returns to you within range to communicate and tells you there's no further to that tunnel the one that had to be there go ahead and make a perception check it's a lot of water ahead and some walls oh on the smaller one you mean make a nature check it breaks fairly easy the wood is very soaked and warped and as your foot breaks through it it's now up to the knee inside of the barrel doesn't shatter you're now stuck with your leg partially in a barrel make an investigation check you eventually pull your foot out of the barrel and look inside in it the smell in there is of deep briny ocean and possibly something that long rotted and has since given this faint scent of earth and decay you feel your way around the exterior of the column glancing around you don't see any particular signs of there being anything different beyond the construction of the rest of the chamber nothing hidden no language or discerning characteristics correct there's no grate it's just another continuation of the tunnel the same size of the one that you entered this chamber from yeah all right so what's the marching order we have fjord in front we have yasha behind that all right frumpkin goes on ahead caduceus and jester nott's in the back with caleb all righty that's right little beau is right there so caleb's in the very back who's next nott or okay okay so as you're making your way through the water this puppy is trying to dog paddle from the foot and a half of water (whimpering) roll an animal handling check you're starting to get this connection between you blinks into your arm and you grasp it now soaked in water it begins licking up your chin and getting excited the two waterlogged pets right now are flanking her throat what could possibly go wrong you didn't have to buy it moving forward make a perception check for frumpkin in the octopus form moving on ahead for about another 80 to 100 feet down this long tunnel it opens up into another chamber that's larger than the one you were previously in it seems to curve open slightly for about ten or so feet and then opens even wider it's a large cube-shaped chamber the same water level resting at about a foot foot and a half up you see three grates that are similar in size to the ones that blocked your entryway there's one on the right one on the left and then one on the far end across from you where the chamber seems to end however there are two platforms that are raised up about ten feet above with a very small railing and two pathways that vanish further in there's a raised two watch points that protrude out and look over the smaller part of this chamber like balconies that protrude from the far wall to overlook the interior of this chamber they push out about ten feet from the wall before they come to an end so they're more of a-- yeah they're not beautifully designed per se they're made of the same stonework but they look to be positions to supervise the interior of the chamber correct there is a very faint dull teal-green glow underneath the water in the far center of the chamber there is also a faint mist that drifts over the surface of the chamber in here currently no movement no creatures it's similar about a foot and a half or so yeah moving up to the very edge of it you can see the interior of this chamber and the display that caleb had described caduceus as you guys are stepping up you hear this faint echoing sound emerging from the upper left hallway you see a very faint bit of light coming and you hear talking no this is caduceus roll some stealth checks all right everyone make stealth checks please you all quietly get low into the water and off to the sides of the entrance to best stay out of range of the light source you guys feel pretty confident that you are for the most part out of range of anyone who isn't fairly perceptive you can see the faint dull glow from the center far end of the chamber now that you're closer and can see there are two similar pillars in the center of the room the last room you were in they were just load-bearing center bits there are some small elements of almost walkways or little bits of stone that emerge from the far wall and the corners that either rubble has built up or it's been intentionally built as some sort of platform there that's off the water at this point you see the light emerge from that side and you hear the voice say the complaints are driving me up the wall zsundie is going to get an earful if he's slacking on those engines liam sam and at this point you watch on the left side the upper area holding a lantern algar emerges looks over the platform there flanked by a worker of these tunnels who's wearing a simple leather frock with gloves and is listening to him and walking up beside his two dwarven bodyguards are beside the two of them as they approach and look over the side he looks over the edge the small railing and looks into the water and goes oh he's sleeping holds up his left arm and begins this zsundie stand to attention you frustrating water spout the glow begins to pulse and the water bows a bit above i'm going to whisper something to you as the water bows up you see it burst like a bubble and there emerging from that space below where it was you see something that looks like an impressively large aquatic humanoid their chest and torso rather rotund their skin a blue-green color long thin arms that end in somewhat webbed clawed fingers their face somewhat fish-like with a wide mouth and small fins that crest the head the lower half of its body seems obscured by rushing water at first but then as it comes to its full stance at about seven eight foot tall you notice that the lower half of its body is just water it's a constant swirling whirlwind similar to the creatures you were fighting in the previous chamber that dull glow seems to emanate from most of its torso in this darkened chamber and it gives this faint light source by its very presence it has a small vest on and sets of jewelry including this thick metal band that hangs like a presentory necklace around its throat it turns and looks up and says at your service it seems to say with an undertone of exasperation and eyeroll algar screams out to it again the archway craftsman are complaining of cold furnaces and slow bellows please ensure enough water is being spun through the engines into the district he snaps his fingers really tightly on his left hand with a low grunt of brimming hatred the creature raises its arms and a large stationary wave of water rises from the depths beside it the liquid seems to form once more and there's a slight sparkle of energy around its hands and this second bowing forms into a large curved wave that seems to be perpetually crashing and then filling itself similar to the creatures you just fought but a much larger scale it whips into its full form and where the head would be bends and shifts-- almost elements out of the movie the abyss-- as it turns toward this figure being referred to as zsundie it spins around and looks up towards the supervisor and his troupe thy will is my bond the two of them begin to turn and shift towards the left hand grate in the chamber i'd say roughly 80 or so feet at this point zsundie comes to a stop and looks over his shoulder in your direction and goes oh intruders algar shouts off what how and holds up his lantern and focuses the beam over across the way there you guys even though you're up against the wall there's nothing to hide behind the light pushes past a few of you and then stops he shouts off dispatch them quickly algar shouts it off to zsundie down below let's roll initiative you will see in a second excuse me for a moment of preparation here this is the difficulty of doing this i didn't know if you were this is the difficulty of doing this in here i know that's all right we will fix this guys and with that guys-- i'd like you guys to place yourselves if you can where you would be on this side of the chamber as you enter there is zsundie and there is the large elemental where you had seen him the worker has run past and vanished into the chamber before and there on the top looking over the terrace the dwarven bodyguards right there and that's algar right there yeah he's the tall one right there for that right there to algar from you somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 70 feet you're not entirely sure yeah roll for initiative guys this isn't working but that's fine yeah oh well oh well it's fine wonders of live well for the time being we'll just take this aside save it for another day i don't have time to troubleshoot right now and tonight's been moving quickly it's not misting-- it's all good so top of the line we have here initiatives 25 to 20 sam and oh wow okay got you all right 20 to 15 marisha and so-- there's a faint glow from there but there is not a technical light source beyond the lantern here so this area is torchlight and then dim light in that area so you can see most of the chamber in dim light the closer you get to algar the better vision you have so we have-- we're missing-- what is caleb and-- all right all right jester top of the round nott you're up yeah you're up first it looks like you may be you might be just out of range for 30 feet you can move a little closer if you want there okay what are you holding are you holding an attack all right that ends your go beau you're up next yes that is algar the two dwarves are his-- sure what do you want to do sure you go ahead and you cast mage hand now they think that i normally do this i don't think that's how it's supposed to work i did it i did a thing thank you guys move it forward for me thank you that'll do i did a thing (cheering) thank you guys now you get to fight it laura and the little things really all right so-- turn that down just a little bit there so guys-- it was worth it for me it was worth it thank you for being patient on that one beau what are you doing okay go for it make an acrobatics check if you want to try with disadvantage because they're slick moist walls i'll allow you to make it as far as here without using any movement go for it yeah that's good let's say from there-- it's a lot of movement but it's also running off of walls that don't really-- to land off of it you're going to have to land this way i'm thinking trajectory-wise make a secondary acrobatics check because you're now running off of two different walls with disadvantage yeah because they're slick yeah that'll put you at there with ten more feet of movement five ten no because you'd finish your space-- because you're in the water at that point and it's considered-- no because you'd be occupying the same space as nott you can see algar barely he has three-quarters cover there you go this is to algar both of them all right with three-quarters cover that's going to be a plus five to ac so his ac is technically-- what were the two rolls the first one hits all right actually yeah-- they don't have a moment to react cool so that ends your turn you throw both one ricochets off the other one (grunt) algar looks what the hell get them that ends beau's turn it is now the water elemental's turn vanishes beneath the water emerges right there yeah next to beau it's going to take two slam attacks against beau that's going to be a nine to hit that's going to be a 17 to hit both large giant slam fist towards hitting the water causing these giant splashes but no impact on you that finishes its turn that brings us now to zsundie's turn zsundie is going to go ahead and angle over this-- actually he's going to angle right where it is you watch as it brings its hand forward and there's this tiny little spiral of dull greenish energy that turns into a jet of really fast-powered water that shoots out in a 60-foot line yasha caduceus and caleb i need you all to make dexterity saving throws please just in that line yes you're not raging yet no that will be 24 points of bludgeoning damage you take half that so you take 12 but that's 24 to caduceus and 24 to yasha you're both pushed 20 feet away and knocked prone yes caleb gets pushed back to there-- actually no you are not pushed caleb yep which means they all slam into you you actually hold that position-- i'll say for the purposes of the narrative here you do get knocked prone from their impact yeah you all don't get shot out of the room but all three of you are knocked prone on the ground caleb taking the brunt of two of his larger teammates-- with that he's going to shift over into this direction that's going to finish his turn caduceus you're up sam and zsundie zsundie (counting) unfortunately that's as far as you can get is right up against yasha you don't know you have to eyeball it it's a little dicey yeah because you used half your movement to get up from prone you're moving through the water fjord you're up next by the way all right the beetles are swimming on the surface oh yeah they're coasting over so right there okay over there it's harrying it so-- you can roll their attack if you want to oh it's a-- it's okay we'll get that fixed in the app it's plus three to hit so go ahead and roll an attack to hit that does not hit unfortunately but you now have a swarm of beetles now here in this dark underground area-- okay okay that finishes your go fjord you're up sure yeah because you don't have to worry about that so you can go (counting) 30 is as far as you can get it will get an attack of opportunity on you as you move so as you rush by-- (whoof)-- reaches out with a heavy-- that's a natural 20 oh because you have a reaction that can do that that's right you can it's an ability of the grave cleric so that's just a regular attack there so that's going to be-- zsundi zsundi 13 points of bludgeoning damage to you fjord on the back of your shoulder as you lunge forward but you make it to your space it still hits as a natural 20 but it's just not a critical hit that would have been a little harsher so what are you doing you're up next yasha it looks like it's pretty close you'd have to give it a shot oh it's a bonus action yeah (counting) 30 with the height that gets you right there that just hits that was with your staff or with your fist all right it's also halved well now you know you're reminded--oh it seems to resist non-magical impacts no so yeah that would have been an attack it takes six damage and the vulnerability goes away so it does full damage yeah but tactically you'll figure it out in the future that's okay now you know that brings us to fjord's turn all righty yeah that'll do it all right so technically you didn't even have to use your bonus action to misty step there no when you-- using the action you teleport yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within range and immediately after you disappear-- actually no the boom happens when you teleport no you're right you did it right so where do you want to land you watch as fjord teleports speaks for a second and then where he vanishes there's this blast of thunderous energy the moisture in the air is evaporated from the impact causing this faint misty orb-like power-- like that thank you taliesin constitution saving throw to each of them so go ahead and roll damage on that one got you that's cocked that's a failure on one of the guards so total 15 you said 19 points of damage failure on both guards algar does succeed though he rolled a 16 he takes half damage they are pushed-- oh no they just take damage impact hits they almost slide off the side and catch the railing and barely pull themselves back into the space all right then is that your turn that was nice finishing fjord's turn yasha you're up you are prone yes so you use half your movement to stand up what's your movement 40 right (counting) yeah you can get there because of your barbarian speed go for it 17 hits go ahead and roll damage all righty that was the first attack you do that with your-- you have an extra attack you can do two strikes it's okay seven does not hit no you swing twice first strike hits second one swings wide as it dodges out of the way it seems like when the first hit its head area where its head would be splits in two one's still focused on beau and the other one curves around to look at you for a second you see this dull glow where its sentient eyes would be and is now focused on each of you does that end your turn yasha all right that brings us to algar algar having this happen goes shit protect me pulls out a potion and drinks it real fast heals up a bit she threw a shuriken at him he's going to move up into this chamber a bit here that's going to end his turn he doesn't want to get too far away from his bodyguards that brings us to caleb there you do yes go ahead and roll some damage what's your spell dc 16 okay failure on the first one failure on the first bodyguard success on the second one okay algar does succeed thank god however this blast of fire rocks the interior of the chamber you watch as both of the bodyguards (grunting and panting) look up at themselves you can see their skin is burned in areas it's cracked a little bit and they look over towards algar look out towards you and you see him defensively moving back towards his position all right that ends caleb's go jester you're up from there (counting) yes you can all righty where do you want it to go here (counting) yeah then you can do that there heart eyes motherfucker ooh a jagged lollipop go for it large fries motherfucker go ahead and roll some damage on that one taliesin and you don't actually see him so you're hoping it hits across the wall technically i should have given you disadvantage because you can't see the target but it's fine i'll let it go through there you go you hear (groan) across the wall you have no idea to what effect it was but you hit something probably algar end your turn all right top of the round nott you're up actually no the dwarves have to go still the bodyguards rush over getting into the space that that's there pushing past to the-- heads this way this one is going to move back and you don't know what this one does because he's moved from your visual range but this one as it pulls back it has a large heavy crossbow and it's going to go ahead and take a shot at you jester from back here actually let's see no he's going to shoot at caduceus because caduceus is already wounded and wants to try and take down those who are already hit that's going to be against caduceus-- it's going to be a 21 to hit all right you take nine points of piercing damage that's all the damage you take and then it moves back and hides in this space here that's going to go ahead and end that go now it is top of the round nott you're up let's have a look here the hand can move 30 feet each time you use it so it can move and do something it's right there yeah all right go ahead and roll an arcana check yep it's less of a necklace and more of a large metallic band that is around the neck like a collar the hand reaches and grasps towards it and pulls but it's locked in place there's no trick to removing it that the hand seems to be able to deal with but it's a good thought it does not have reach with its slam so no all right go for it 17 hits go ahead and roll damage nice 23 points of damage well done all right that finishes your turn that brings us to beau step of the wind lets you move as a bonus action right oh that's what it means gotcha so yeah you can disengage you use a ki point your bonus action to disengage correct up to you what're you doing beau all right so it's going to swing towards you that is going to be an 18 to hit whoosh just past you okay it's still your movement so if you're wanting to leap off and parkour all right so we'll say that's about 20 feet to get there go ahead and make an acrobatics check this is still disadvantage because it's slick natural one so-- so you land and slip right into the ground the water splashes you're underwater for a second you use the rest of your step of the wind extra dash movement to get up from prone that's your bonus actionyou still have your action and movement all right (counting) i'll say if you wanted to try and vertical leap from here go ahead and make an athletics check to see if given the circumstances of the turn you can make it 22 i'll allow you to just get the final distance on the edge and have to correct yourself and then catch it on the ledge but that's the end of your movement there towards you can barely see algar just around the corner three-quarters cover and then there's the protector who looks fairly hurt i mean they all look pretty hurt the fireball wrecked their world a little bit no no unfortunately none of those hit so they ricochet off the stone walls and your foot is still slick from having to balance on the edge and when you throw them both you have to compensate and they both go wide but good try no that's it that's your action bonus action and your movement so the elemental is going to whelm into caduceus and yasha's spaces and it's going to make-- it's going to make a whelm ability so each creature in its space i need you both to make strength saving throws you have advantage because you're raging that's a failure 18 that's a success so you are grappled until it ends you are considered restrained you are unable to breathe and yeah that's it currently so you're restrained grappled unable to breathe you are pushed out of its space yasha so you are shoved out at a corner there you manage to free yourself but caduceus you now see is swimming in this creature as it's spinning around it's swirling like a giant water spout in the center of the chamber and this guy here is going to go ahead and move out into this space and knowing what it summons it's going to go ahead and pull another water jet this one is going to go ahead and shoot through what it thinks is you passes through nothing but it's going to go for caduceus and caleb as well so this guy will move right up there (counting) yeah it hits you so i need you both to make dexterity saving throws the water elemental has to as well and fails so that's 25 points of damage you can't retract-- all right so that's 25 points of bludgeoning damage to you caleb you're unconscious but you're not making death saves you're stabilized yeah you are no he's face down i mean-- well you can still drown with it on but what's your constitution modifier yeah you have like three minutes before you drown sitting there so you're okay for now we'll say for just the purposes of like you're not sucking air in necessarily nah yeah you've convinced me out of it we'll get to it no that's right we'll go to constitution saving throws on your turn all right so finishing that noticing that that is an illusion and seeing you across the wall-- no it's not so it turns away and goes underneath here and glances up towards beau you see as it glides across the water at rapid speed it seems to travel very quickly through any sort of water surface and can jump quite a bit that brings us to caduceus's turn at the top of your turn because you are still whelmed i need you to make a death saving throw because you immediately take damage as you're caught in the spiral of its whelm so you would take 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage but you just instantaneously lose a death save and it's the end of your turn i need you to make another death saving throw that's a success no it's only when you're using hit dice during a short rest fjord you're up what are you doing okay so you can see the hallway behind here that continues back all right so for that we'll say i finally get to use these he's used the ability before yeah and what do they have to make saving wise go ahead and roll damage seven points all right that's a natural 20 for the first bodyguard so it takes three points right all right the other bodyguard that's a natural 18 and then for algar that is a 14 so he takes seven points of damage he goes unconscious not that you know that all right does that end your turn fjord okay step out to the point you got it all right that brings us to yasha's turn caduceus is being swirled around on the inside his unconscious body just being kept with the current so you're timing it for a moment and go for a swing the beetles they just have their attack increment they don't have the full action spectrum no it's just a straight roll so the first attack was what oh it was cocked okay 19 hits so go ahead and roll damage for that one 18 points of damage on the first strike you carve through you watch as a big piece of it splashes away it's looking hurt it's not heavy but you're starting to see some wear and tear on the creature you make your second attack no it looks like he's still held in there no you don't have a means for getting advantage remember you have your reckless strikes is that what you wanted to do all right usually you say that at the top of the turn but it's been a while so you can do that it's all good it's all good 24 hits yeah go ahead and roll damage 15 with the second carve carving through you are now cutting away almost like it's a gelatin dessert and you're seeing the pieces sloughing off of it it reforms back slowly but it's starting to sputter and bits of it are having a hard time keeping itself as a full form you can see foam gathering at the edges of it that finishes your turn are you going to move that's right the beetles would have probably clambered back into the staff when you fell unconscious sorry buddy you're going to back up it will yeah so you just continue engaged and holding it in that moment okay that ends yasha's turn algar is going to make a death saving throw that's a failure all right caleb your turn no make a constitution saving throw that is a six we're going to go ahead and say that you are in the beginning stages of drowning so you can survive a number of rounds equal to your constitution modifier two rounds yeah so you have two more rounds before you drown nope no yeah at the-- if you run out of breath or are choking you survive the number of rounds equal to your constitution modifier at the start of your next turn you drop to zero hit points and are dying it gets a little weird it gets a little weird here because you're stabilized you're stabilized by the necklace kind of it gets a little weird it is yeah we'll say-- kind of so yeah you're stabilized and you're fine physically we'll see where it goes we'll see where it goes in two rounds all right that ends caleb's turn jester you're up all righty go for it well cure wounds is still an action so you can't do both in one round unfortunately spiritual weapon is still somewhere in those tentacles but you can't see where that is make an attack with disadvantage we'll say that probably happens there oh got you it unfortunately does not hit anybody because of the-- the one that it strikes has a higher armor class than 15 but-- well no he's at two death saves yeah that's a melee attack that does that okay that ends jester's turn yeah okay going past to get there the water elemental gets an attack of opportunity on you he does well now you know that's going to be a 17 to hit he doesn't hit you (clanging) you shrug it off from your armor and shield liam and that's your full movement there all right does that end your turn that brings us to the compatriots here at the top of their turn they take how much damage 2d6 go ahead and roll 2d6 for both of the dwarven bodyguards you can use your reaction to you can yeah well no if it didn't hit you i don't think does it say an attack or a hit i believe it has to be a hit doesn't it when you're damaged sam and gotcha so those left standing-- just barely full damage oh dex save every turn a success and a fail-- no both successes actually both rolled really high that round all right so two damage to each actually all right and they can't see anything they both haven't moved since the last thing happened so one reaches down and you hear some rummaging he gets dragged-- yeah yeah no he can't drag him out of there it's not enough movement for him to get in so-- other one's just going to move into this space here you hear some more rummaging you hear a (grunts) what the fuck that's it sounds like algar's voice his bodyguards are prepped with a few things nott your turn yeah all right he's currently facedown floating in the water so five-- 30 there you'll run back in the water no you're a little further away that'll get you there you can probably get him it's 30 feet from you there mage hand was here last okay okay i'll let that happen sure i'll let you do that you watch as his unconscious body goes-- (laughter) you do not break any teeth damn it i was hoping-- having a crystal vial jammed with that speed into your mouth there was a good chance you were going to lose a tooth or two so go ahead and roll heal for caleb was it a basic healing potion 2d4 plus two heal seven hit points there you go that ends nott's turn beau you're up there's just a black sphere and occasionally you see this dark strange grayish slime-covered tentacles that whip out and back into the-- move away from him right there you mean okay got you okay got you finishes your turn beau's holding that top of the round is the water elemental it's going to go ahead and move over-- it's still carrying caduceus along you get to go ahead and make an attack of opportunity to see if it shifts because you have the sentinel feat ten does not hit goes wide unfortunately does reckless last until the end of your turn or until-- yeah but it's out of her turn this is a reaction let me double check real fast during this turn it doesn't work towards reactions unfortunately so swings wide it's going to go ahead and move in let's see if it means-- yeah it gets its whelm back it's going to go ahead and move into jester's space so now both jester and caduceus are caught inside-- it's going to attempt to i need you to make a dexterity saving throw so you are currently restrained you're grappled and restrained you take 13 points of bludgeoning damage so constitution saving throw regardless that is a-- hold on what is the save type on that dexterity that is going to be a 13 that's 11 plus two that's a failure i believe on your dc oh because it's a racial ability oh yeah so no takes half damage right yeah reduces its speed by 20 feet until the end of its next turn 11 points of damage as it reaches and gets a little frozen and its movement is a little sluggish it's looking really hurt 13 points of bludgeoning damage and because technically caduceus is still-- at the top of the turn no because you got healed by jester so you also take 13 points of bludgeoning damage so that's going to end-- the water elemental's turn it's now zsundie's turn zsundie is going to fly into the air right up here and release another water jet through to both beau and fjord i need you both to make dexterity saving throws please you and fjord you succeed fjord you fail it's dc 16 so that's going to be 21 points of bludgeoning damage to you 21 points and ten points to you fjord i need you to make a constitution saving throw to see if you maintain concentration you do you succeed and with that it's going to go ahead and continue flying coasting around out of your range and turning his attention towards the center column there no you do i'm getting to that point right now so on a success you are neither pushed nor prone but you do (launching sound) 20 feet back technically so you would (crashing sound) right in the ground there you sploosh into the water and you are prone down at the bottom again so that ends his go caduceus at the top of your turn because you are still whelmed you take seven points of bludgeoning damage staying in that water elemental is not good news i know end of your turn make a death saving throw fjord your turn no you just drop the spell yep to the water elemental go for it and you're not doing anything else right roll your attacks you don't know yasha hasn't had an issue with it yet fjord then yasha okay as you drop hunger of hadar you can see they're both looking rather ragged and algar is on the ground coughing and sputtering as one of the bodyguards is pulling and tosses an empty health potion to the ground that shatters as soon as it goes dark they both go huh and all three of them look at you go ahead and roll attacks for both the bodyguards that misses that guy 16 does hit him falls unconscious on the ground (impact) hits the wall (grunts) and crumples into a pile unconscious all right 15 20 25-- you can move right up into the space right next-- looking down at algar right now end your turn yasha you're up (heavy metal guitar starts) go for it 13 does not hit that's with advantage okay second attack also with advantage it's for all your attacks now 15 does hit 17 points of damage as you strike through with your final strike the blade carves right up the side and like cutting through a large wave it sprays up into the ceiling and restores itself jester and caduceus no longer being whelmed in it you're still unconscious your animals are no longer drowning this way there finishes your turn yasha yes is that an action just has you do it then yeah you can do that sure yeah you watch as this dark-- you guys don't see this-- algar looks to his left as the body of his bodyguard which has been blown in the chest falls over and immediately bleeds out and dies this darkened shadow begins to tug and drag out of its body you watch as this spectral ghost that has faint barnacles and elements of dripping sea foam and thick ocean water drooling out of its jaw emerges and stands over going (sinister breathing) algar right now is-- if it wasn't so generally wet in the chamber you could see the puddle forming under him he is bludgeoned beaten slimed within an inch of his life and is looking at the specter looking at you and is like (fearful noises) for his turn he is going to cower he is just going to put his hands up and try and drag and put his back against the wall and is just sputtering unable to make a word that brings us to caleb's turn it's a spell of first-level or higher and a cantrip there is a feat you can take at level eight to do what you did in the last campaign you can move i'll say two squares to there you mean okay back corner of the room here you mean okay yeah you can do that 16 for his dexterity saving throw go ahead and roll damage he takes half damage all right first damage to zsundie (explosion) as the flames subside and pull back the evaporated water in the vicinity turns into this cloud of mist that (hisses) around steam fills the upper chamber for a minute and as the steam pulls away from zsundie barely scathed by the fireball (growls) just glaring right at you caleb you got it that ends your turn jester you're up all righty nice yep you can't see what's around there yeah so make an attack with disadvantage 19 hits the other bodyguard go for it (impact) argh and you watch as two armored feet (boof) on the side the other armored guard collapses on the other side algar's seeing this specter rising this drowned wraith emerging from one bodyguard and the other bodyguard (smack) on the ground next to him looks up at fjord just stepping over and walking towards him in the far corner so that would be (counting) right there wading through the water as you get over all righty that ends your turn jester nott you're up algar algar is-- szundie make a persuasion check unmoved your words fall upon deaf ears as a focused semi-ethereal water-based elemental entity is steady his eyes filled with driven command and murder anything else you want to do he's thinking about it hmm okay go ahead and curl around there go ahead and make your stealth check 22 all right you feel sufficiently hidden beau (grunt whoosh) there your bonus dash will get you a full jump you can get about there with your full movement with the half lost from the prone-- (counting) you're in the chamber now with fjord as you round the corner you see the one recently crushed dwarf the other has this drowned wraith pulled out of its body this specter looming over algar and you see the back of fjord standing over algar who's (panting) on the ground scooting away okay he's now pinned against the wall your knee against the jaw and the chin he's choking against the pressure make an athletics check eh sam and you had to remember make an athletics check make an athletics check to grapple yeah he is fully grappled by you and shoved against the wall that ends your go it is now-- szundie's turn szundie yeah it makes sense szundie's going to go ahead and lower down and see the hobbling caleb making his way up through the water and caduceus-- still a five-foot line though yeah you're still in the space it's not like a little tiny stream it's a big (splash) i need you both to make dexterity saving throws because you are prone-- no it doesn't affect your saving throw so yeah 19 success success so that is-- ooh that's a good roll that's 24 so that's 12 points of bludgeoning damage to each of you caleb goes out and gets pushed 20 feet back again (boosh) whoa way into the back there caduceus is like argh but you're still holding on at this moment and it is going to go ahead and appear right next to you holding this trident now that apparates in its hand and it's rearing back to go ahead and start all right caduceus you're conscious cure wounds is a touch i believe healing word is the-- all right 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier that's right grave clerics man all right all right so we'll say for purposes of this right now you get up turn invisible-- okay yeah you turn invisible get up and then you want to move-- you can move two squares we'll say fjord he's like (choking sounds) he can't do anything but you can see the bracelet right there on his wrist-- what do you want to do with being grappled coup de grace just go ahead and roll an attack just for the hell of it with advantage with a sparking grinding noise you all hear echoes as the blade carves across the stones and you watch as a splash of water it looks almost like a water razor just (slash) through the area and the hand just falls off onto the ground the bracelet slips off of his wrist and he's (muffled screams) and is now screaming against the guttural pressure placed on his throat in that moment you watch as szundie-- the trident goes limp disappears from his hand just gives you a look turns around and then begins to drift up in the direction of where algar is and that's where we're going to end tonight's episode yep we'll find out next week it seems that somehow you've freed this entity whatever that means we'll find out next week so we'll find out next week yasha
