yeah (sad bear huffing) (disappointed bear huffing) (excited bear growl) (sniffing) we knew that was going down (sad bear growl) i'm going to try and sniff where those treats are five that's a failure (frustrated bear growling) i adjust my armor cross my bear arms and go yeah it's been about six months if i recall i'm not supposed to leave i'm watching the place for mom while they're gone on vacation i think about it every night i'm sorry what depot oh honey depot right right yeah no i got that on the first time through appreciate the clarification you promise you'll have someone reputable watch over the castle can i meet at least one of them get a smell off them see if i can trust them imagination do i get a sense that i can trust these bears that's a success all right tova i accept your deal only problem is i don't know where the rest of the troupe is we've been scattered over the past half a year in the parchwood all right (growls) all right you got a deal tova all right thanks okay i'm going to go ahead and check up in my mother's room in mama vex's room and see if she has access to any sort of a satchel or pack that could have some enchantment that could help us carry things along borrowing that's a failure all right shit i respect that could have used that bag of holding okay then let's see i'm going to go ahead and go to the armory of whitestone castle and see if i can find any rope chains weaponry i'm going to go see if i can get some very tiny well-made silverware from the kitchen and use it to pick the lock success rope chains any weaponry that might be useful because i know we're going up against ninja bears looking for weaponry in a hidden place all right that's a failure i like that good for him being safe with his firearms responsible owner especially with children on the way probably i guess it's time to assemble the team i'm going to go ahead and make my way out to the parchwood and start sniffing for any familiar scents find my allies that's a failure sam and oh finally good to see you too las vegas you all right peddy i slap him success pull it together peddy well i need you back on it friends compatriots or whatever the hell you might be we did some good work a while back did we not well word came to me not too long ago that there might be another operation that could use our particular skill sets so as opposed to wandering here in the forest failing to find honey gorging on meat and sleeping until it's nighttime like an asshole how about we all get back together for another try at the gains and the glory huh no no we ain't heisting from the government we're heisting for the government they're hoping to get more things from the tal'dorei council to improve our sight and healthcare but we're a few months off because it is indeed golden word is this terrible bear acuda-- the people we tussled with back then-- they've taken fort lox they've taken it good and all the honey that'd been making its way out here to the sweet side of this end of the lucidian ocean it's caught up that means whatever you're enjoying that's going to dry real fast unless someone does something that's what we're talking about buddy except they did it if they can do it we can do it better right peddy tell you what i know these woods pretty well maybe a quarter-mile up the way i know there's a little bit of a patch of bamboo used to be part of a de rolo garden long ago before it was forgotten you think that'll help wake you up a little walk with me all of you walk with me let's check in we all might be a little rusty see what skills we got in the bag huh i'll tell you more along the way come on cheers to that who's going first after he crashed the last wagon they won't let him back all right trinket this time has been focusing a little more of his downtime to be a-- what's a five in fact i've been focusing my skills even further the same path look my papa-in-law bless his soul and mama vex has dabbled a bit in that direction i paid attention i think it's time that i follow in the family's footsteps you know thief it is what you got vegas it's a sliding scale really looking fit i think we could use you at the front all right i think we got a pretty good spread here guys not too bad yeah well it's hard to get it out here rots away by the time you get it over the ocean all right so here's the deal the bear acuda have taken fort lox it's all under their management their holding there's one at the top one son of a bitch hattori bongo the hattori bongo himself thought dead for many years out of hiding takes the fort for himself ain't no one standing up to him that's where we come in they're looking for assaults armies broken at their gates but five slick-as-shit bears coming in there in the shadows and a badger four-- look i appreciate you being forward with that and we respect your sensitivity to the matter and we'll keep that in mind going forward but seriously get with the program we got to get in there take out destroy kill disseminate disintegrate whatever-- these ninja bears get in our way find this hattori bongo take him out alive or dead i haven't been given a preference and if we can free the honey flows free and this group of five right here we get to take a ten percent cut ad infinitum ten percent it might be a little true liam and that's why we got to strike first we got to strike that's right there's a section of the parchwood right there it's about a hundred acres of wood that's a lot of acres we got to get honey to eat it well we can go back to whitestone i was trying to find these dewies right we haven't left yet i think we're going to need to stock up how about you all find your way back on the outskirts of whitestone castle don't want to freak out our guards there i do indeed all right follow me we all in three two one-- i like that all right come on i lead them on back to whitestone to the outskirts of whitestone castle yes i'm not taking them through the city wait-- you have to understand even though it's late night here it's going to be hard for us to infiltrate the city without freaking folks out who think we're a bunch of roving bears we've got to disguise ourselves there is one haberdashery inside whitestone city we can help blend in with the locals at night time you know all the drunken folks who wear hats and throw up on the sides of the road noted just to blend in you know i didn't have one specifically named but-- i don't know you're the one who designed most of the city's infrastructure that's where my speciality comes in you see all this time you cats have been wandering the forest and eating whatever you stumble upon-- meat for some of us-- i've been practicing my skills and i pull out the same bits of silverware that i took from the kitchen super tiny the little things you'd stick on the ends of the corn cob to make it easy to go all the tiniest bits of silverware that i can get i'm going to wait until the coast is clear of any of the various guards and see if i can break in through the back of the hat store i'm going to take 2d6 on this both fail so when we fail we move a point into criminal right i'm going to turn to them and use my terrify skill as trinket to spin around drop my silverware and go (roaring) for bear that's good because i had accidentally misallocated my points earlier i'm on the cusp of going feral correct yes that's a success on bear for the terrify skill hey muscle come get the door you break that shit down i'll turn to liam real fast and say remember what we talked about at the edge of the forest i'll flash back when we were at the outskirts of the parchwood and we were sitting there pulling cigarettes out of our mouths like all right so we want red hats green hats brown hats black hats specifically wide brims short brims long brims high brims whatever type of hat you can get just grab it we'll see what all comes out in the wash all right back into the moment remember what we said cookie mighty impressive five it's a cowboy hat i did oh it's a d8 let me roll again wait hold on i rolled the wrong dice well no i still rolled a-- the number would've been a five same thing oh i still get a-- i still got a five anyway so it's the cowboy hat (laughter) fits better than my cowboy hat does wait we didn't get any honey we've got to go to the slayer's cake the point of getting the hats was to hide as people to get the honey because we've got nothing in our stores shit you're right i can tell that all right lead us on waffle you had five bear and you failed i can certainly try best make this a quick in-and-out they know me-- i don't want to cause any ruckus all right who do you want it to be all right waffle come on let's go as me and waffle make our way to whitestone-- (bear grunts) that's helpful anything else you want to prepare with slim pickings mama took it all with her i'm going to go pick up some more thieves tools from the kitchen like a meat tenderizer and a turkey platter no hold it in is this how other bears live this is what happens when all of the whitestone tax cuts go to the one percent bears just pisses me off you're right i'm sorry i trust him he's never let us down before bearman steve bearman (shushes) well they-- (cooing) vinnie was working with the ninjas we don't want to get too close to the wedding because we're not invited so we're going to stay on the outskirts looking in until they exit yes i'm going to pocket some bamboo just in case just to have it there i'm going to not take any of the meals as i'm not feeling the honey in the belly at the moment but i go ahead and pocket some of that-- more than necessary using my thief skill if need be i don't want to draw any attention that's a success with a one for a success you move over to criminal look this goes well maybe there's a possibility we can keep working maybe under the banner of these people i stay with they're mostly retired at this point anyway so we'll talk about it we'll talk about it at the end i like working with you but i got a family i'm a family man it's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me anyway (laughter) let's do it one paw up no it's unfortunate it's not right at all here's my question young polar bear tiny-dick friends chief chief what are you hoping to accomplish with these signatures who's going to see these and what's it going to change is my question oh i'm not going to lie i've traveled with these gentlemen for some time and you won't find a better group of betas out here this side of tal'dorei but don't hammer any dicks what if a dick is hammered on its own that's really unfortunate i'm feeling for your plight the more we have this conversation to be fair peddy from what i've heard some of your people have had a hard time with keeping their dicks up for a while too right i'm sorry i don't want to-- anyway peddy you got this careful hey bryce all right peddy good choice no peddy yeah how'd you guys get up here anyway there we go maybe you trade your cart for ours okay okay okay got the microphone sorry all right what you got las vegas show us no no the point of the game is to not be the one to knock them in there and you can't hammer the dicks yeah the instruction manual on it is pretty terrible all right who's on that side (groans) all right peddy you've got this peddy hold on i can't bear this tension you're building here las vegas it's getting a little tense we respect the materials you brought to this endeavor no not underneath the guy peddy come on you can-- (shouting) i'm glad that it could bring all five of us to a very dramatic climax sam and thanks appreciate that first bit of feedback-- no it's good ship it just the tap that'll help for the dlc (as pumat sol) well hello there my name is pumat sol owner and curator of the invulnerable vagrant where me and the other pumats have got everything you need for your exciting and potentially deadly adventure looking for standard wizard

one respectfully when it comes to quality products for a reasonable price no one in zadash has us beat respectfully so come on down to the invulnerable vagrant located in the pentamarket district in the heart of zadash open during standard business hours and weekends the invulnerable vagrant when it comes to enchanted curiosities respectfully we're the best [upbeat synthesizer music] [beep] guys you know we're starting right all of us together yeah make sure you guys can vouch for us if need be since we haven't been inside his facility all right las vegas lead the way right are we looking at any sort of difficulty as far as weather patterns in the near future when you planned your wedding don't want to deal with any little rain clouds or-- all right i appreciate that maybe it's a french stewart movie i don't think he's ever done a movie vinnie my gracious pooh-- trinket we haven't been introduced you as well happy to be part of it i have a question for you you wouldn't happen to know or heard of the whereabouts or hopeful safe status of one kody yak would you no worries just asking thank you fair enough you're generous with your blessings that's a good question the pooh junior the tiniest pooh you've ever seen yes it's a security thing can't assume it's a he remember it's progressive times in tal'dorei i haven't seen christopher robin yet so maybe she's spoiled it for me quick brains see if you can find a way to cleverly ask if this hattori bongo has any fears weaknesses anything we should know all right you take this that was good i had mine removed it got inflamed when i was in high school it really is vinnie thank you so much for your time maybe the bridesmaid too we're sorry to bother you when you've reached peak levels of intoxication we'll leave you to focus on that which matters did you say dis-koala-fied never asked the thief to steal for you while they're doing this i'm going to keep an eye out and see if there's any signs of possible bear acuda infiltrating the wedding anybody who is masquerading as an attendant or planner for this event that looks a bit mischievous does being a person who's good at infiltration give me any bonuses i'll just roll the dice i'll roll the dice i succeed all right i think we're okay i hide it in my beard sorry i'm just remembering that scene from trading places with dan aykroyd eating salmon through his dirty santa beard that will never leave me anyway continuing pocket salmon i'm writing that down it's all right if worst comes to absolutely worst i got a plan to light those fireworks trust me let's case the joint and get our bearings sorry hey las vegas if i can try and sneak you up quietly how fast do you think you could tear the throat out of this ninja it has enough claws give him something to say oh bother about i try and sneak him up jump on back he gets on my back and we're quietly going through the shadows that is a failure five and a six on a criminal of four it's all that heavy whitestone food sorry it never is muscle and carnage here's what i'm going to do i'm going to quickly try and stealth around him i have one helping of bamboo that i took earlier from that section i'm going to try and put it right around this guy's face and turn to peddy and try to get him to eat his face off all right no not at all it's a success ew oh lose criminal go to bear i was going to say yeah give it to him that wasn't bad it was good it was right around it was barely there how'd you figure that out that's true las vegas stay focused i understand but this is shitty outside quality honey we want the good stuff that's hidden inside stay on target don't worry about that i can help you out i've seen him making a few crazy things success look you can't build something unique like this and not give it a name i suggest good tidings you're the one who built this get on las vegas get on i'm seeing all this and the urge to tear into this comes into me i need to get myself up and mentally ready for this so i scoop down into my pocket and pull out a thing of honey and start devouring it feverishly which you got a point back for (growling) i have honey foam gathering at the corners of my bear mouth (growling) not wanting to call too much attention i go up towards the one that just deflected it and thrust him against the wall and put my arms up there pinning him i go you're going to die sucker and try to get him to piss himself and drop his guard success as he pulls his claw out of the head i go told you i step away success means you move to criminal i lean in (growling) take off your clothes oh you will it's been a rough seven months for these two the one that he killed i'm going to take off his ninja clothes and put that on me to help me with my thieving shit sorry it's just hard to bear all this violence around me actually that's not a bad idea i'm going to eat one of my honey as well (muffled) hop on is it the bear formerly known as kody i got this don't worry i pull out my meat tenderizer thieves' tools (laughing) and fucking bust the shit out of this like a thief does success see a little finesse doesn't hurt can you lead us to them show me i think i may have seen some of these before fail i can tell you've been making the beavers jealous you might want to clean it off first i know exactly what that is that's what my papa in law is now producing no be careful with that no don't point it towards your face hey hand it here here's the thing i've watched papa-in-law do this a bunch you take one of the small shinies and you put it inside the big long shiny you pull back and when you let go boom it puts a hole in what's right next to you kind of yeah it makes a lot of hurty-hurt on the thing that's right there yeah a message that will kill it taliesin and be careful with that i'm going to go ahead and seeing as how a dexterous attempt doesn't seem to be working i'm going to slam by bear self into it repeatedly to try and get it to tip over success good to know yeah i think so just in case i'm going to eat some honey brian and pushing it give it a shot you were reading it the wrong direction gets me every time if you had failed that you would've lost it i've survived every battle i've ever been in no one can take me down trust me we'll be fine i don't know what that means come on let's go can i take a look at that and pull out some of my more delicate and quiet silverware and see if i can find a way to break through the lock without being noticed that's a success with a four starting to get them wily ideas about a crazy future (whines) (cranking click) we ready for this hey waffle you got them fireworks ready when shit goes belly-up you throw them in i'll follow suit trust me if it gets real bad and anyone's hurting we'll all sidle up and form a bear-rier to protect them a bear-ricade all right i'm going to have my last jar of honey in preparation hold onto that memory all right ready all right we do it for the honey paws in three two one-- (boom) i push the door open (puzzled grunt) is it sweet is it tasty yeah how much will that piece blow up is it the color blue oh it's not even blue oh my god what we knew you were fit for the task taliesin that's amazing hold on as the second hit hits and they're all guarding i'm going to try and use trinket's thief skills to ninja roll between his defenders and see if i can grab the balootonium from his grasp success it's okay don't worry that's all right we believe in you in the shattered teeth far south of the continent of wildemount i already grabbed it however there are still two ninjas i'm like guys run i've got this trust me i pull out the potion i had found earlier and i go who's ready for some celebratory fireworks i throw it to the back corner of the room near the ninjas it's a potion of fireball that reads i've run out of passions-- no it says passions roll to cast produce a fireball that inflicts d6 damage per caster level to all creatures in a 20-foot radius reflex save for half damage he just went straight to d&d rolls for this one so i'm holding the balootonium in one hand and this potion in the other and i go (slow-mo voice) run (whooshing) we all just turn and start running as it flies towards the fireworks do i have to roll anything d6 per caster level how many caster levels does a bear have all right oh no that's a success it also put me at full thief how many caster levels is the potion i want to roll dice that is 14 points of fireball damage as i'm running down the hallway-- are the fireworks going off i barely cradle the balootonium taking the brunt of it with my body i auto-success i stand up and looking at these four guys the wily glare in my face of one who has completely turned to the side of crime and lawlessness goes i'm sorry friends but i've got my own plans and i go running the other way i'm running staring at it i'm just laughing wildly as i'm looking at it so much power (evil laugh) see if you can force me to swallow it (laughing) honey-boarded i'm all right oh god i'm okay oh my god where did it go the honey's here i like that way of thinking i'm also okay with that look we saved the fort as far as i know let's go ahead and clear out what remains of this bear acuda and then return to tova let her know that it's been cleared and take in our ten percent benefits for-- las vegas if anybody asks he sacrificed himself bravely and it had nothing to do with my potion he was a martyr and a champion and i had nothing to do with it that was amazing that was so good don fettuccine the entire rule set the graphic is now appearing on the screen
