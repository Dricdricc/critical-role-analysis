hello and welcome to critical role the game where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play dungeons and dragons tonight we have an interesting continuation of the story we'll be picking up here shortly first and foremost we're going to get ourselves through a few announcements and some cool things you guys should know so first and foremost for returning fans and people watching the show thank you and if this your first time live or your first time seeing the show hopefully you're not too confused and welcome as well first and foremost for those who haven't seen it yet we've been doing spotify playlists for each of the players and the characters we just finished that whole sequence with mine that went up today so if you haven't had a chance to check it out you can go ahead and check it out i did a playlist based around many of the npcs in the world of exandria that vox machina have come across and just a couple little tidbits about their characters and their backgrounds and one song per npc that rounds out their personalities so check it out if you're interested hopefully you like it and you also get an eye into my taste in music too we had a new comic come up this week didn't we laura (laughter) i will say laura you plop down drunkenly very adorably all right cool so go check out the comic drawn by our wonderful artist wendy and this is all leading into a retelling of the winter's crest festival the first one that vox machina had in the city of westrun so go check it out and see other updates my class update also went up yesterday and it was actually just updated before the show tonight with a couple of fixes to some of the text and stuff so if you've already downloaded go to the website and download the newest one it's 12 it's called the bloodhunter it's a retool of the witchhunter taking it away from the promotional aspect that it was tied to back in october i was able to retool it and make it something a little more wholly my own and my own unique design as opposed to being tied to the preexisting ip so it's got some cool abilities i hope you like it if you feel like running it in your game or allowing your players to do so have fun not the seal of approval i would say i did manage to have some wonderful feedback from mike mearls from dungeons and dragons at wizards of the coast he was very very sweet enough to give me notes and ideas when i was going through the redesign process so thank you tremendously mike for that it's still my real first homebrew class that i've ever designed so it's far from perfect and there'll be adjustments as time goes on and play tests and balance things come through so be gentle but it should at least be fun let's see marisha you wanted to talk about super power beat down real

this really inaccurate description by sam riegel-- the critter's guide to critmas and last but not least if anybody has any other announcements or projects coming up that they'd like to mention there's a wii u game that just came out called xenoblade chronicles x where i voice a character named lao that just came out recently so if you're a fan of those awesome rpgs i will be really subdued and arrogant in your face exactly every week anything else guys we good all righty now let's get down to the nitty gritty (sound effect noises) the lights swish all right so to get you guys up to speed as fast as i can-- this is a really long arc the briarwoods being a family that five years ago took over the city of whitestone where percy hails from murdered his family and he barely escaped with his life years later came back into the folds of vox machina's existence and it was decided to go ahead and hunt them down and save the city of whitestone upon arriving they began to stir rebellion in the town against this horrible undead menace controlled by lady briarwood herself after this rebellion was incited fires were burning individuals were killed that were responsible for keeping the people down and just generally bad people all around were being slaughtered by our intrepid adventurers they made their way into whitestone castle where they had uncovered some information about the ziggurat a project in which the briarwoods had been developing something beneath the city of whitestone and discovered that percy's sister cassandra who was thought to be dead long ago actually still survived and was being kept in the castle she joined the party as you guys fought your way down underneath the city of whitestone through a series of tunnels finding yourselves unintentionally locked within a trap a retooled version of what was previously an acid distillery for the whitestone that's actually mined from the surrounding mountains and thought left for dead by the briarwoods themselves in which vax was charmed and taken along with them and cassandra showed herself-- well acid's bad in general you know it's not like oh this acid's fine i stand corrected no it's probably not going to happen it's not acid resistance on your armor it's citric acid resistance very possible anyway back to the story upon facing the danger of this trap and seeing cassandra turn redcoat to them with the briarwoods the party managed to think their way out of the trap before too much damage was taken and following the briarwoods to the final chamber where the ziggurat was constructed where apparently there is some sort of ritual underway to some entity they worship or work with that they refer to as the whispered one upon following the party dividing up and following up the sides of the ziggurat they managed to catch an encounter with the briarwoods a charmed vax and cassandra before they could enter the actual ritual chamber a battle commenced where thanks to proper preparation did not go all so poorly and in the process sylas briarwood was destroyed through a combination of sunbeam via keyleth and some pike shield deflection-- a very avengers moment with a hint of phallic imagery sylas's destruction sent delilah into a mournful wail and she decided to try and complete the ritual herself although it may or may not have been too soon to do so dimension doored her way into the ritual room which you guys followed over the wall she seemed to complete the ritual creating this small vacuous spinning black sphere that is locked in place vex was nearly felled by a spell as she attempted to fly in and stop it the party then rushed in to aid vex percy took a shot that intentionally did not finish lady briarwood just taking off her right arm as she fell unconscious bleeding out vex unconscious from the fall and also on the cusp of dying the party rushed in to help her and realized seemingly the vicinity around this orb had cut all magic so thus they were snatched up and escorted off the side of the ziggurat and that was where we left the last game to pick up where we were who had vex in their arms last time was that you grog you have vex in your arms who has delilah and who has cassandra okay so you have delilah and and vex who has cassandra okay so as you guys are rushing down the steps of the ziggurat itself the green glass-like jade material slowly fading into the whitestone as you rush towards the base with what little bit of light was available to you from the small bits of torches placed at the bottom of the ziggurat and what light sources you brought with you you find yourselves at the very bottom of the dirt looking around there's the exit where you guys originally entered this chamber you do also see a number of small metallic carts some turned on their sides you can see crumpled bits of whitestone and shards of that green glass residuum material left out you can see there's piles of leftover building materials that are scattered about the floor of this area so you guys are still a little bit behind the rest of the group you're on your way now you're just now rushing down the stairs of the ziggurat while the rest of you have reached the bottom save versus uranus that is what i said the next errata document she's manacled behind you and cassandra is tied up as the rest of you rush down to the bottom minus vax and keyleth do you wish to wait for them or push on to the tunnel where you entered so you know that they're following you so at this point as you're having this discussion you guys are rushing down and you guys see this as you're rushing down the ziggurat the radiant energy that is currently the form of pike seems to have slowly dwindled and she looks over her shoulder with a look of immediate fear as it blinks out it seems as if whatever anti-magical aura has slowly pushed the divine connection that keeps her present from the current vicinity so you guys push on making your way to the cavern and heading back towards the undercroft vicinity of whitestone you guys have just now made your way towards the exit tunnel so you're just now leaving sure well you push and make your way into-- as you guys rush behind you head back into the tunnel having to lower your head a little bit as you're carrying this payload you're lumbering through giant goliath body just stomping through-- yeah you come to where there is the partially-dissolved stone door and you rush underneath and using all of your back muscle-- make a strength check (grunts) tensing the entirety of your muscle structure-- oh it's not about you being heavy it's about the door itself not being quite large enough for him to come through carrying that large of people you (grunts) lift it and you hear the stone (scraping noise) shift as it's forcefully pushed up you hear snaps of things breaking or supports that were keeping it in place as you essentially break the door and jam it upward giving you enough space to pull through the rest of the party indeed greatest nemesis of vox machina she's unconscious now you make your way into the top level of the distillery room down the pathway into the upward ramp to the opposite side the door open and you are now outside of the distillery trap you're not currently with them though you're behind with vax trying to catch up yeah you want to stop for a second and pull it out okay she (thudding noise) rolls bounces a little bit from the sheer force of the throw you're not even paying attention as to whether or not she's still breathing you reach in your pouch and bring out your potion set vex down and hand it to her you go ahead and heal 2d4 plus two hit points yeah there you go that's actually a pretty good roll at this point as you guys have pushed outside of that room it appears to be functioning again okay go for it roll for that at 1st level so 2d8 plus your spellcasting modifier whatever your wisdom modifier is okay at this point keyleth and vax catch up to the rest of you guys sure which at this point just a note in all the chaos and all the intent trying to get things out of there you're just now starting to realize that the seeming spell that you placed on the whole party has also been canceled as part of whatever this trigger anti-field was so you all look around and realize oh we aren't a bunch of percys and cassandras trinket's nuzzling the body okay (skype sounds) all right so you go ahead and check on her go ahead and make--actually this is pretty easy you just go ahead and take a moment you just feel her for a pulse she is currently still alive and with a flash of divine energy just past the outskirts of this anti-magic field you can see pike's radiant ethereal form all of a sudden reconstruct itself laura and she is currently alive she's unconscious and she's thankfully from the blast and the sheer force of it part of the wound was cauterized but she has been bleeding quite a bit on the run down here and she would probably need some sort of-- you go and inspect the barrel no sylas briarwood is currently erased from the barrel if you want to so yeah as you guys are having this conversation grog comes over and pulls out a mottled mass of really filthy rags from the bag of holding probably used in various nose-wiping circumstances but somehow it manages to stop the bleeding and keep her relatively stable for the moment yeah okay pike did you say you wanted to cast mass cure wounds you said okay you can choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot radius so it's your choice who you want to heal all right so that's 3d8 plus five for you oh to have a cleric in the group again oh let this be a lesson to all the people out there who think clerics are lame and nobody loves them okay so you pull it and you gag her around the side of her mouth and as you end up tying it you see one of her eyes lulls open and she kind of (coughs sputters) up to you what do you want to do (laughing) roll a strength check (whack) right across her face you hear a resounding crack sound as it appears some part of her cheek bone probably is going to be fairly bruised tomorrow but she is straight to unconsciousness again (cheering) she's still breathing okay as you're standing in the tunnel they're off to one side you go over to where cassandra is you briefly set her down to have this conversation she's still bound on her arms and legs-- she was nearly hogtied by grog when you guys finished up at the top of the temple she's breathing you can see the dirt from being tossed to the ground is caked in on where the tear marks are down her face you shake her gently and eventually she comes to consciousness and her eyes roll around for a moment she glances over at you percy i don't what what's going on she starts moving around looking around the tunnel real fast at everyone what happened what's going on and as you say this you see she reacts as almost someone had just punched her in the chest and the tears begin to flow down her face again and she i'm sorry okay (slap) go ahead and roll a strength check 15 yeah okay you smack her to get her attention in this circumstance she stops for a second and gathers herself her breathing slows and she stares off into space for a moment probably i don't know they wouldn't let me near it i'm not lying do i have a reason to lie right now and she looks over at you with an intensity to her gaze that catches you not as desperation but as passionate self-loathing i know i know she leans her head down on the side of this cavern wall and stares off into space all that i know about this is that they've been building it under the guidance of some other person or entity they referred to him many times as the whispered one they're very secretive about it the only reason i knew was because i overheard a few conversations and questioned them about it to which there was punishment but they mainly kept me to try and keep the people at bay my job was to keep in contact with anyone who would attempt to rise against them and inform them i would prevent any surprises although apparently (chuckles) and thankfully i didn't do a very good job and she looks around the room at the rest of you roll a religion check mr bard a lich entity yeah cassandra shakes her head and says honestly i didn't know anything beyond the name i just knew they were very close with this individual i know there was a blood ritual involved i did not know more than that there was to be a gift of power should i give an element of my life to this ritual she shakes her head for a second she blinks her eyes and she says i don't feel like i was right in my head i look back on so many decisions i've made and all the people that i've-- the tears just start flowing again 14 best that you can read off her is there is a deep look of regret and sorrow in her face and you do notice that through most of this conversation as much as she's been able to talk to all of you she has been unable to make eye contact with percy i mean you've already done half the job her eyes look over at the unconscious delilah in the hallway she thinks hard for a second her eyes squinting i don't they spoke very little-- intentionally i think-- of what they wanted to do to be honest i think there was an element that even they didn't know quite what they were doing i was a tool i was to be used i had my purposes i did my best to fulfill them she glances over at her and with a stern look on her face she goes someone needs to avenge my family and for the first time she looks over and makes eye contact with you you feel a pulse in your hand like a heartbeat (thoom) the gun itself seems warmer and warmer and you guys all notice as a bit of smoke begins to billow out the sides of percy's sleeves you hear a familiar voice creep up in the back of your head percival here at your mercy the deal was never changed the deal was made you made a great sacrifice for my gifts percival do not let it be in vain pull the trigger you're placing the gun against your own head percy no percival don't do this we made a deal what are visions if not a window into the future you understand so little percival do not make me regret sharing this with you (chuckles) the smoke still billows out from you at this point go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw you do 20 you feel that warm pulse that was in your hand earlier that was coming from the gun it pulses like a heartbeat in the hand that was holding it and for a second you feel like something grabbed your wrist and slapped it away towards your back reaching for where bad news is and then you (grunts) rip control of your hand once again delilah whose eyes are still rolling after all the shouting that's been going on as she comes into consciousness with a gag around her mouth and goes (breathes heavily struggling) and her eyes dart around in fear you can see that her makeup has run down her cheeks from her own lamenting over sylas's loss and the confusion over the ritual and the fear all of a sudden turns to seething burning hatred as they dart around and then (struggles again) she can't talk as this is happening the gag falls away from her mouth from the magic hand she's glancing at you and the smoke is now billowing up stronger to the point where you can barely see percy's torso you can see his head now and what little bit of a view you have his eyes have gone completely dark there is just pitch black completely encasing the entirety of his visible eye you can see his feet still dangling beneath the smoke and his feet are digging and tensed into the ground delilah is looking at you right now and the anger and fury in her eyes clarified she just looks up and you've already taken everything from me interesting you seem to be struggling percy okay okay so minor illusion as a limitation it wouldn't be a full-body illusion but you can take elements of your features yeah where once percy's face existed it twists into this shimmering apparition of sylas briarwood looking down at her as his face contorts into horrible screaming pain the head rises up and almost soundlessly he screams out as the flesh begins to melt from the bone as it does percy's voice rings out in this cacophonous roar that shakes the cavern around you i don't know i don't even know if it worked we've been preparing for this ritual for five godforsaken years all to repay a debt and that's all you forced us it was too soon we were waiting for a particular date there is a time each year in which the barriers between realms grow and grow very weak you recall erevan's attempt generations ago to blur between the realm of ice and this one which you call the winter's crest well this is too early and you saw our failure he will not be happy i imagine and i still owe him for what he gave me for what he gave us at which point her eyes well up with tears and she looks over he gave me my sylas back and you took him from me again so do what you must do i know i've paid my penance and i know that no matter what steps you take now it will only drag you deeper into this dark hole you've drawn yourselves and you will hear me laughing make a strength check 19 (impact noise) you hear (clinking) across some of the lower rocks as two of her teeth go scattering out the side of her mouth no okay make a sleight of hand check so five (giggles) make a perception check so you watch as scanlan looks around grabs it picks it up and (clink) the full barrel comes off of the gun pike you go ahead and make a religion check it's tempting 17 okay not a whole lot more information than what scanlan was able to ascertain from this you just know that this entity known as vecna once a very powerful arch-lich had once attempted to ascend to godhood and was supposedly halted in the process a battle that occurred on another plane amongst heroes that only a few came back from but apparently stopped a very terrible thing but that was hundreds and hundreds of years ago you do know that-- sorry you do know and pike relays this too in particular vecna is known as for lack of a better term the patron saint-- or lesser god to those who worship-- as the deity of secrets dark secrets things that wish to be kept out of the knowledge of most of the world at large and these secrets are coveted taliesin tell me what your persuasion and deception skills are inter-party insight way to point that out i would also like you to make another wisdom saving throw at this point you feel your hands tense up and once again begin to reach towards your back you close your eyes and with all your will and might you just scream no instinctively it wasn't even a conscious thought it was just an animalistic response to feeling your physical form being taken over and in that moment every muscle in your body tenses and you guys watch the smoke momentarily drift from his form behind him behind him at this point you can see this smoke that was once billowing from percy is now standing in this outer human-like shape as it stands there for a moment it begins to swell and grow larger filling almost the height of the ten-foot tunnel that you guys are standing in looming over percy's body still connected through his shadow through the floor of the tunnel itself it just looms over and as it peeks forward you guys for the first time hear the voice that's been poking through him this entire time just say percival do it then let's roll some initiative (yelling) (laughs) that's pretty great actually you haven't taken a short rest yeah so right there with her it's too late who's standing where i'm going to say pike's probably-- percy is currently right here well more in the center there talking to everybody with cassandra on the ground there right so you guys would be probably back here your daggers ready trinket is probably over by you of course and keyleth i'd say you're probably on this side talking to percy i have you right here between him and lady briarwood right there you would have a clear line of sight the two gnomes are between you so you're fine we're going to find out in just a second so first and foremost initiative order we have 25 to 20 wow okay so we have vex two 20s 19 to 15 19 16 okay 15 to ten 17 oh 17 all right you did that's okay pike what did you get eight yeah all right first and foremost vex you're up with the initiative on this you go ahead and you bring your holy arrow and you release it technically no it knew you were there it was very aware of everyone's position and was essentially after being forced out of his body at the moment preparing itself for some sort of assault so not a surprise round unfortunately so go ahead and make your attacks with your arrows if you'd like both of those hit i'll consider that do 1d4 radiant damage to it in addition to that so 17 plus-- 21 for the first one all right so-- all righty you did that's okay all right you pull back and release the first arrow as it goes and hits you can see the smoke itself is obscuring its place and keeping it hard to hit but you still strike true the arrow striking into its form and there's a flash of radiant energy as it hits and you see the creature takes from the impact and stares down at its chest as it looks up its face turning towards you and it is this formless humanoid body but the face itself does pinch into this elongated crow skull-- they impacted all right takes both the hits and looks over at you and you can see as it turns the head you can see better even in this low light the shape of its face and its eyes burst into this angry burning purplish energy expression and it looks very unhappy with the current circumstance do you want to move you or trinket okay there you go that's it you're just going to keep there all right that ends your turn scanlan you're up next it's about 12 feet you are which means you could blast towards the wall and hit it okay all right so you it's right there in front of you as the smoke rises up and you see the arrows strike it there's the flash of holy energy from vex's attack and that moment as it's distracted you use that to conjure a lightning bolt and (lightning sound) for a moment the flashing of light lights up the cavern around the bolt passes through it harmlessly the lightning bolt passes through it and it strikes the back of the wall and you can see the electrical energy discharge across the stone and earth arcing and spidering off until it dissipates seeming to not have any sort of impact or effect on the billowing smoke entity you want to stay there or you want to move you are in its melee range you are in its melee range so if you move it will get an attack of opportunity if it chooses to take it okay all right take your d10 this moment of intensity as you turn around now at this point seeing everyone striking you've looked your head over and you can see for the first time in full physical form the creature that has haunted your dreams for the past five years while it is not present you can feel it smile it's your turn okay okay so you pull out the-- okay unfortunately it's going to to free her entirely of her bonds and give her that it's going to be your action i know all right it is now vax's turn what's giving you advantage on this because he hasn't gone first in the first round that is correct yes all right so both of those hit okay right do you want to sneak attack with this because in theory it's in melee range with an ally with percy and with scanlan don't rob yourself of what you do we're working out the bugs it's a process we're working on it all right cool 15 points of sneak attack damage so as you throw the two daggers plunging them both both of them their little aura of magical energy flashing as they both impact the smoke form seeming to sink slowly as they hit and then finding the edge of their blades sunken into its torso as it rears back correct all right cool that are you going to stay where you are vax all right now it is the entity's turn as it rears and the daggers both vanish from its torso returning to your belt side it is glaring down at you to its side and it says percival don't make orthax regret working with you shifting this way twice percy you will get an attack of opportunity with your rapier if you'd like all right 25 hits go ahead and roll damage nine points of damage all right good to know now on the rest of its turn as it shifts up it doesn't walk or move its form drifts along and the shadows meet it there the smoke almost appears at the spot where it intends to go and then it meets it in that moment as it does it now stands between a bunch of you its eyes flare with dark purple and you just hear this scream this screeching (scream) echo out from it and as it does all of you hold your ears for a second i need everyone to make a wisdom saving throw you have advantage okay so all of you guys hold your ears for a second and everyone that rolled higher than a 17 takes six points of psychic damage correct you guys both take 13 points of psychic damage both of you feel all of a sudden like your brain fill with this urge to strike something this overwhelming need to slash out at whatever's near you both of you get a brief move grog that's going to pull you this way and vax it's going to pull you this way i need both of you guys to roll an attack roll as you rush up with your hammer flames and you swing it down towards scanlan okay roll the attack okay so 19 all right roll a d10 all right so cutting words if i recall-- right so that brings it from 19 to 16 what's your armor class with that the bard's words ring true to your mind and for a second you feel this new this not grog-based rage this outside forceful rage that it confuses you and as he says that you're right he is no hollaback gnome (laughter) vax i'd like you to go ahead and make a dagger strike against pike rolled a 13 pike you look over your shoulder as all of a sudden vax appears behind you and slams forward with the dagger you whip around with your shield and with a large striking arc of sparks deflect the blade blow across the dark air of this interior tunnel harmlessly you take no damage and with that you know what it's going to go ahead and do this the entity then moves backwards pike and scanlan-- oh you already used your reaction to do cutting words so you don't get that pike go ahead and make a melee attack one reaction per round just roll a d20 roll for your normal mace attack 17 unfortunately does not hit it seems like it should've but the smoke is obscuring the vision around it and where you swing you do not manage to get quite close enough to hit its body as it steps backward into the wall and out of visual range into the wall it just vanishes into the side of the tunnel that brings us to grog yeah okay okay so like right there okay if you want to you can hold you can use your action to ready an attack so whenever a trigger of your choosing happens you can then make your attack okay what trigger would you like okay and comes within melee range okay so you're holding your action there good to know keyleth you're up okay all righty faerie fire where do you want it just in this vicinity okay so 20-foot radius so we'll say probably in the back here and forward this way so this area between these so as keyleth you put your arms up and this burst of glowing luminescent pinkish-purple energy begins to sparkle through the air like glitter suspended in low gravity and it drifts through the air in the entire vicinity you can see it clinging to you guys a little bit all right are you going to move or you going to stay where you are step out of the faerie fire or into it okay am i just ten feet okay ending your turn keyleth pike you're up no as far as you know-- yeah it's radiant damage and let me pull up the-- yeah you have no visual on him the smoke entity has moved into the wall and is nowhere in your visible range right now so you have nothing that you can attack in theory that you know of if you have any buff spells anything you want to do in preparation for it or hold your action as well until it reappears you can do that okay are you staying put are you moving at all or do you want to stay where you are okay cool so you shout that out at the end of that cassandra now who has been unbound gets up her weapons were taken from her when you bound her so she stands up and puts herself to the wall and looks at you with a-- okay she takes the rapier and looks at it and goes running away back towards where castle whitestone is if you want to instead of holding your action cast something you can do that what are you going to choose you get to choose a certain type of creature which he's protected against you have no idea you saw it briefly i'm going to have you roll a religion check being a religiously trained individual let's see if you can ascertain the nature of this creature this entity 22 okay in the brief moment you got to see it the way it moves the way it completely cast aside scanlan's attack and the way that it housed itself within percy for so long there are elements of it that make you think of a shadow demon but usually they're not this large they're not this powerful either this is just a powerful entity of a similar type or it's been feeding over time or it's something beyond that but you get the sense that this thing is demonic in nature based on the brief appearance you had with it okay so that would be fiends so you choose fiends great so any attack rolls against you from fiend creatures have disadvantage she's thinking he might be based on her roll then knowing that going forward that may change your next round of combat good to know so you are currently are protected from fiends vex you're up first make an intelligence check just roll a d20 and add your intelligence and you have advantage on it because he's your favored 12 okay you know that these creatures are incorporeal they can generally shift in and out of solid matter as a way of moving and defending itself you know that they're difficult to fight in the dark you also know that they because of their form are generally resistant to a lot of types of elemental-type damage and lighting and cold no effect whatsoever as well as poison that's as much as you can ascertain with that roll yeah you can actually sense him he's maybe ten feet inside the wall he's currently hiding in the wall yeah okay go ahead and roll a stealth check yeah what okay good to know so you (wind noise) flatten yourself against the wall best of your ability okay so you're going to hold your action until he appears other than the torches you guys have been carrying through here yes glowing from the faerie fire but it's a gentle glow so it's very low light in this area yeah it's like a nice basement bar a good dive (laughs) ending your turn scanlan you're up no all right you step out of the area and it all drifts off your body and you're no longer affected by the spell not currently no yeah you can do that all right ends your turn percy you're up you're just stepping out of it there you can keep going if you want okay ending your turn vax you're up all right good to know all right at that moment as you vanish to the side the entity pops out from this side-- right behind you as you're preparing and all of a sudden (whoosh) smoke billows out you turn out of the corner of your head at that point everyone who was holding your action you're doing your attacks simultaneously he is currently yeah he didn't see it being cast he withdrew before it happened so he steps right into it yeah all of your attacks on him currently have advantage 14 unfortunately misses you fire and (ricochet noise) it seems that in a strange way the gentle pink dust is actually obscuring your vision with the dark shadow in that vicinity and it blasts a piece of rock off the side of the wall so fire reload 26 does hit go ahead and roll damage all right good to know this is piercing right all right the blast hits but it appears that the expected impact from the blast of bad news-- a bit of smoke dissipates its impact and it seems to not be as damaging as you expected it to be all right that brings us to the next person who was holding their action i believe scanlan you were what do you want to do good okay it does not make its saving throw it rolled a four so it takes 3d4 psychic damage go ahead and roll that and it has disadvantage on its next attack roll five points of damage boom on its next attack roll its eyes go darker purple for a second like it can't contemplate the fact that it just got insulted mid-battle and then they flare up again even more furious as part of that it's going to use its reaction it turns towards you and in-- what languages do you speak you hear a muttering through your ears (mutters in foreign language) and for a second you feel your field of vision close down like it's focused entirely on you you're currently marked by its mark of vengeance yeah so essentially there's an effect that's intent on you at the moment nope all right that ends your held actions no you're up yes second one hits you go to strike the first time and as you swing outward you catch smoke and it dissipates around the blade and you stab into the side of the wall second attack (impact noise) okay this blade however as you stab into this cloud of smoke you feel there is more physical presence to where it was and it sinks in and you feel this reverberation as it reacts to the pain this dull (hoarse growl) growl sound okay you used it last turn that was his reaction to you holding your action that would have had to be during your turn when you hold your action you just get the action when it triggers all right so that ends vax do you want to do anything else right there yeah all right there you go good to know and you were holding your action and you were holding your action so everyone make your attacks yes you did all arrows 17 misses unfortunately what's the 19 from right so you rolled a one and a two yeah it doesn't work that way okay so one of them hit all right so you go ahead and roll damage on that 24 points of damage so one of them flies forward and misses-- yeah nearly grazes the top of your head just vanishing you don't notice because you're currently (growls) right in his face second one manages to strike it and splinter inside of its torso and you can see a flash of energy from the impact and it (squawking groan growl) surveys the area around it the smoke around it gets even more intense and you can see it flaring up yeah so the smoke gets even thicker and obscures it even further and grog okay 28 hits second attack 26 hits yes so an extra 1d4 radiant damage on each strike okay burning holy wrath 22 all righty (impact sounds) both hammer blows strike it battering the smoke around and you can see as this hammer swings through its body the smoke almost swallows the light and for a second it's almost like this dull orb of darkness beneath the surface of a deep lake and then as the hammer emerges from its body the light flares up again it's almost like it's swallowing the light as you strike it but it seems to be taking the impacts pretty hard all right that ends your turn now orthax can take his turn all right so let's see that's right you were holding too yeah you can do it too thank you for reminding me all right go for it what level of guiding bolt are you doing what level of guiding bolt are you casting okay so that will be (chuckles) roll to attack first you have advantage on the attack roll because it's currently inside faerie fire so take the higher of the two rolls okay so at 4th level that would be 7d6 radiant damage laura and yeah for the purpose of ease i usually double i'm just confirming one thing real fast yeah so go ahead and do your math 21 all right yep so that would be times two just confirming it has been a while since we've had any sort of spell-based crit so that would be 42 points of radiant damage laura ashley and as you release this bolt of energy out of your hand you see it charges up and fills up your hand shaking as you're waiting for the moment where it might be too much to control and your holy symbol flares as it releases and streaks forward right behind you you were technically in melee with it which would have given you disadvantage on the attack but you had advantage on him because of that and we'll say it's fine it stays there because there were a lot of things giving advantage against him and then disadvantage we'll stay with it as you turn around you release it point blank it slams into the front and you can see where the smoke was swelling around it it almost seems to be scattered away from the impact of this radiant bolt and for a second this image of this obscured shadowy humanoid becomes very clear and you can see this extremely muscular humanoid torso with elongated exaggerated arms and fingers seemingly featureless across its body other than its black obsidian torso no legs they disappear into the smoke beneath it its head has the long hooked birdlike skull beak and where the eyes are it's just this smooth almost leathery texture across the dark body itself you can see what looks like faint horns that curve around the back that curl upward and as it takes the impact its head rolls back and you can hear this billowing scream (moaning cry) as it leans back forward towards you it looks like it's having a rough moment now we get to its turn all right based on that it zeroes down on the little ball of radiant energy staring before it that just blasted a hole in its form it's going to take all three of its strikes at you pike and has advantage because she's in faerie fire so it cancels it to a natural attack that is 21 what's your ac 20 so that hits 27 and a natural one it was like 19 one all right so that would be 14 points of psychic damage oh no i'm sorry because of the roll there-- that's 14 plus an additional 12 so that's 16 for the first strike right it was 12 on top of the original amount which i said was 16 14 and 12 yeah so it was 26 psychic damage you took on the first strike and the second one was seven too 21 the third one it has three attacks yeah it would be 26 and 21 so yeah 47 points of psychic damage as its arm reaches out towards you and strikes also i need you to make a wisdom saving throw with advantage you're doing your hunter's mark damage so what was that 20 yeah you feel as its claws move through your body elements of its shadow essence reach up and try to grasp an element of your willpower you shrug it off the might of sarenrae is too strong and it has no way of grasping your intent unfortunately that used all of its movement it cannot withdraw into the room that will be the end of its turn let's see if that recharges oh it does okay that brings us to grog yep you're back up to your turn now go for it okay hits just barely okay 18 okay you hit the side of its body and you can see now small cracks in its black form are starting to form and you can see a bit of that purplish energy leaking out it's starting to actually visibly show a difficulty in keeping its corporeal form as both blows slam into it you can see it shaking and there is a struggle to its movement do you want to stay where you are or do you want to move okay keyleth essentially about 12 feet yeah okay all right which that is a concentration spell interesting i would assume that was this little spark ball of daylight opens up on the ceiling like a bright spotlight that fills the area as it does you can see the creature (howling groan) shrinks away from it and its smoke actually dissipates lowering its armor class again all right are you going to stay where you are or are you going to move okay all right with that okay there's a momentary whisper in the shadow around you and the sound of chains i want everyone to make a perception check 26 okay so all of you continue focusing all right pike you're up what's your turn okay same deal go ahead and make your single attack roll right now because the previous thing is-- okay yeah so this time it's ready for you and it dodges out of the way the blast hits the stone wall behind it and cracks it slightly do you want to move or stay where you are it will get an attack of opportunity on you it's up to you that would be the lowest that's 2d4 plus two okay you heal eight and did you want to move back or stay where you are okay so you stay where you are all right cassandra keeps running off this way and halts for a second he sent her running away top is vex you're up yes pike and grog and technically trinket as well are all in melee okay it's advantage against him yes 21 hits both hit go ahead and roll damage these will be your last holy arrows because you've used six okay yeah that's right yeah so these are just regular nice all right nice 42 points of damage this round these arrows now find their way towards the cracks that are starting to appear in its chest and as each one strikes in these arrows are actually visibly staying in its body what was once this amorphous smoke after the impacts from grog and as it begins to wear itself down it's starting to find it harder and harder to keep this ethereal form so now these arrows are sticking out of these cracks of purplish glowing energy and it's moving a little more sluggishly okay make a stealth check scanlan you're up good to know all right you do you just feel like there's an aspect-- you get the sense you probably don't want to be close to it that's the scanlan i know and love suddenly there's a stained-glass wall behind it okay okay all right what level are you using healing word at level one okay 1d4 plus five all right roll damage 3d4 psychic damage eight all right you can see now it turns to you for a second and the mark of vengeance fades as suddenly you feel like you've damaged it mentally enough to the point where it doesn't even want to deal with you anymore you're far too mean you're going to stay where you are okay that ends your turn percy you're up you guys all glance over the shackles that are on the ground are now collapsed and empty with the gag safely removed from her mouth during this allowed her to cast misty step which is a verbal-based spell she is currently-- i'm calculating that right now i'm going to have to ask you to roll a perception check here in a minute she landed cast invisibility and vanished and you just hear the footsteps down the hall you're not quite sure where she is or how far she's gotten but you know she's down that way yeah cassandra doesn't notice she's just been running because you told her to run she did hear you shout and she looked over her shoulder but not in time for her to see anything happen because this all happened during the last round during your realization you guys look around and delilah's gone you're the only one who really saw the direction she's going but it's your turn what are you doing trying to catch up okay okay all right so that's percy's turn for the situation make a perception check no you do not have advantage on this 23 okay you see a couple of the recent footsteps but you don't see them freshly being made so you know she's not too far yet good to know vax you're up okay so you use your bonus dash your movement to get there so you move up 60 honestly once the creature's invisible and you don't know where it was you don't even get a chance to check at this distance so it's just attacking at disadvantage all right 14 is a miss (whoosh) it returns to your belt finds no purchase that was an 18 seven plus 11 is indeed 18 go ahead and roll damage eight okay at this point as you're running you're rushing forward to the left of your ear you hear (impact noise) and you glance over your shoulder and there face down on the ground is delilah sprawled out face down in the dirt with a single dagger sticking out of the center of her back and then it disappears and blood begins to pour out from the wound all right you'd have to go and inspect now it is orthax's turn orthax is going to move here still remain in melee and is going to use a secondary rampage pulse since it recharges gives out another desperate scream (raspy roar) outwards in the vicinity 20-foot radius i need keyleth vex trinket pike and grog to all make wisdom saving throws with advantage 12 oh 25 total 12 okay so vex keyleth and pike you guys all take five points of psychic damage as you cover your ears momentarily grog and trinket both take ten points of psychic damage both turn immediately flanking pike who has been the radiant blaster across this entity i need you to make an attack and i need trinket to make an attack against pike you guys both have advantage because she's in the faerie fire 13 okay all right so pike this blast comes out ringing in your ears and as your vision comes back to you and you look up all you see is grog lifting this giant hammer with his eyes clouded in the same black smoke material you bring up your shield and as the hammer comes down striking at you you know there's a bruise going to be on your forearm tomorrow because the sheer force of it hits you but at the same time you know it's not the friend you grew up with and you look up into his face as the cloud fades and you can see an expression of immediate regret on his face before you can respond though the bear behind you trinket snarls (roar) and latches on go ahead and roll damage i'm going to have to probably go bite on this so roll the dice and then that times two so you take 11 points of piercing damage as all of a sudden trinket sinks his jaws into the back of your shoulder oh oh that wasn't with the multiplier what did you roll on the dice on the dice so 22 plus whatever the modifier is okay so 16 plus whatever the modifier is there we go thank you so much for clarification 15 points of piercing damage and trinket clenches down you feel the armor plates jamming together and it wrenches your shoulder out of the socket not enough to actually do too much serious damage and immediately trinket pulls away and you hear this whine behind you this (sad moaning) his nose rubs against your head okay orthax is at a point where-- no orthax is going to turn and begin to chase after percy now yes i know grog and pike and trinket all get attacks of opportunity with advantage yeah okay and pike 16 does not hit unfortunately so pike you swing but still in pain from trinket's attack and grog coming at you you swing wide and it passes through the space behind it grog remember to roll with an additional d12 too because of your brutal critical 13 for trinket awesome 31 total how do you and trinket want to do this (cheering) okay as you slam it on the ground (boof) the smoke billows out around it and dissipates for a moment where as opposed to its obscured form you now have a very clear view of its physical body just a little bit of smoke trailing about where its lower torso and legs would be as its arms reach out (slashing noise grunt) and it looks up its head shaking as the purple cracks are rising up its body it looks up straight into the face of trinket who snarls (growl chomp) and just lunges out clamping onto its face and tearing upward its head arcing in the air as it does the body (whoosh) dissipates into smoke and sinks into the ground into this black shadow in the dirt that (whoosh) races up the hallway in the direction of percy percy as you're stopping and looking over you look down just in time for the shadow to (whoosh) reach your legs and you feel this cold rise up your body and then slowly dissipate into this little nugget of cold in the center of your chest and then vanish cassandra who has now stopped looks at you she clutches the rapier in her hand and you can see her hand shaking the tension of the muscles in her fingers clenching it as hard as she possibly can as she walks up with each slow quiet step echoing across the stone (footsteps) delilah up against the wall blood spilling out of the corner of her mouth (coughs) coughing conscious with her one missing arm to the side blood's beginning to ooze now from the wound as the sheer force of all the movement has torn the wounds fresh open and she's there and she looks over out of the corner of her eye and turns seeing the rest of you and sees cassandra as cassandra steps up she holds the rapier at her side staring down this time a single tear cresting down the side of her cheek delilah looks up and goes you could have been my daughter she looks down at delilah and says no cassandra is a de rolo and you took them away from me and now we're taking everything away from you and thrusts the rapier forward right into the chest as it hits her it actually pulls her up about a foot against the wall the sheer force of the wound (gasps sighs) last breath escaping from delilah's mouth her arm falls limp to the side the moment of tension passes and cassandra's still holding her there her head down her hair in front of her face just shaking keeping her pinned against the wall the rapier withdraws and the body tumbles to the ground she looks back at you face just a mess thank you we do and she hands the rapier back to you and she grabs the scruff of delilah's collar and begins dragging her up the hallway towards the castle she drops the body and gives you a look hurry if there's one thing i've learned here in whitestone it's that things do not stay dead long (laughs) okay inspecting the body you find a very fine pair of metallic bracers her robe though soaked with blood is very very well-made okay so you roll up the robe her cloak is-- okay you take all the fabric the robe and the cloak so mark those down the cloak itself looked like cloth at a distance close up you can see it's actually a very fine dark black/purple fur and down at the side of it you see dangling these two long tentacles that end in these little cupping spiked elements it looks like it was carved from a creature at one point the cloak go for it yeah you've actually fought these creatures before this is a displacer beast it's a cloak of displacement yeah she's mostly nude other than her undergarments the only thing she has left is a ring on her finger
