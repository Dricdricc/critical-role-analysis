and welcome back to our second half of our shadow of war game brought to you and sponsored by wb games thank you so much for letting this happen all of us are all voice actors in the game in case you didn't check out the intro to the first half we're excited to bring these orcish characters of this one-shot together if you haven't seen the first half you should probably go back and watch that first otherwise you'll be really confused yeah fine but yeah shadow of war comes out october 10th looking forward to that the shadow of war ios and android game is out now so check it out anyway bringing us back in as the forcs-- travis and as the forcs have taken their break to rest themselves for a moment to assess what to do next you are now standing on the opposite edge of one of the mithrim spur mountains just past the crest as you traveled down you found hidden in this alcove six uruks five of which are currently sleeping and bundled and one who's keeping watch with a burning torch nope the minute you hear the (cracking) sound you hear this faint (grunt) sound over the cliff as you glance over you see the one with the torch is now like-- about 25 feet from you 30 feet down below he's now walking toward one of them to start-- make a performance check sure how-- what are you going to do because it's a two-headed owl no sorry what'd you roll (laughing) so it's a (gurgling) laura and the uruk keeping guard immediately goes what the shrak goes and starts shaking one of them awake okay he doesn't currently see you necessarily roll a stealth check does not seem to see you so roll advantage on the attack so go ahead and roll the dice well roll your sneak attack damage too because that all gets doubled as well well you don't add the modifier to it yet double dice so 22 times two as he's shaking one of the uruk he's like hey get up oof (gurgling) the one uruk's like what the shit i was sleeping the other one's like (gurgling) and falls onto his back dead he's like huh the other one's getting up he's leaning forward now inspecting the one who was there keeping watch you could appear right behind him if you wanted to all right so as you're doing this you slip into the shadows and quickly dart through the shadow appearing behind the one who's waking up he's like what in the-- what are you going to do make a grapple check so go ahead and roll athletics all right so as it's sitting up from its weird tattered bedroll you whisper in its ear i speak for sauron grab the back of its head go ahead and roll an attack to try and bite into its throat 13 roll damage okay seven points all right as you pull the head back and bite into the throat it's like (gurgling and gasping) you tear a chunk out of its throat but it's making all these gurgling noises all the other uruks start rousing so what do you want to do go for it 13 all right go ahead and roll damage second time all right as you go (growling) still alive bite down again and pull out another piece you're taking chunks out of this orc's throat but it's still alive it's like (yelling) reaching up and grabbing at you now and it's got the back of your head and is trying to pull you onto the ground all the other ones are rousing and grabbing their weapons they're in an alcove like a little cliffside platform at the side of the mountain there's a mountain wall and then an outcropping and they're on the outcropping it's hidden recessed below you if you want to try it's about 25 feet down below so you pull out a small pouch-- all righty so-- all right roll 5d8 32 so two of the uruk that are getting up out of bed are like (grunt) reach for their weapons and are like (grunting then snoring) and fall immediately back to sleep the other three however are still rousing up from their slumber yeah at this point combat is definitely engaged i need you all to roll initiative well no because it affects creatures with the lower hit dice and you actually have a higher hit point value than most of them there so you weren't affected all right seven all righty all righty all righty so skak you're up first you just threw the sleep powder into the air you watch as they get to their feet and begin to pull their weapons out it looks like the fray is on you're at the top of the combat round what do you want to do okay go for it yeah the guy with the throat is the only one that you have sneak attack on 15 hits all right that's up to you they're about 25 feet down below on this cliff okay stay up on your perch got you you still have a bonus action if you wanted to hide all right there you go so skak is up in the open mozuu you're up the uruk so go ahead for the attack five you go to bite and this time it's reached over and it's grabbed a blade and a dagger it jams the pommel up into your mouth and it hits the roof of your mouth (gagging) you're now being partially choked by its blade by the hilt of its blade so your first strike does not hit it you want to try a second time you have the pommel and hilt jammed up into your jaw and it's trying to keep you at bay not at the moment but you could bite down if you wanted seven you try and bite down on it actually breaks a tooth on the inside and you're like ugh you feel the pain sting through your jaw this is a stronger uruk than you expected and it's currently putting up quite a fight so that ends your turn mozuu all right arby and this group are all going at the same time so what are you doing arby okay so as you leap make an acrobatics check 25 feet yeah mozuu make a dexterity saving throw okay so you suffer seven points of bludgeoning damage as you fall from the cliffside above as you fall you land like a large cannonball right in the space where mozuu was mozuu at the last minute mouth filled with gore and dagger looks up and sees the shadow encroaching kicks away just as you (impact) you land right on the guy he had so you slam the maul into the ground because you don't know where he is you look around for a moment to look down and realize that your feet are six inches deep into the torso of this once-living orc that has been splattered on the ledge all right all right go for it 24 hits 15 all right that'll destroy him all right so so it was seven from that one to okay as you land and crush him you swing wide with your giant maul and it hits one and pins it against the wall it hits it and slams against the wall you watch it splatter across the side destroyed all right that'll end your turn arby as that's happening the orcs are getting up and grabbing their weapons there are the two still sleeping as all this is happening they're (snoring) in the middle of their bedroll these two other ones that are wounded are going to stand up they're both going to go after you since you're the one who just arrived aggressively the first one's going to swing at you that's a ten the side of their battleaxe clang against your armor no effect a natural 20 one on a d10 so that's two plus-- you take five points of slashing damage from its critical hit you deflect it with a chuckle your giant olog-hai physical self able to withstand such paltry blows you're called unstoppable for a reason all right so that ends the orc's turn there the one you crushed there the one that's sleeping yeah they don't get a saving throw until they get hit or the spell ends fun all right there's a third orc right now that's backing away hands up full belly shown like (heavy breathing) no no no eden your turn roll an acrobatics check please 15 all right you land on it without issue and you actually reduce the damage from the impact to two you only take two points of bludgeoning damage from the fall as you land on top of it go ahead and roll a d4 add your strength modifier oh god which one is it four so you land and it slams onto the ground we'll see if it manages-- nope it's knocked prone so it falls onto the ground you're on top of it currently felt a bone snap somewhere in its ribcage the back of its shoulder blade it's currently pinned onto the ground underneath you all right go ahead and roll some attacks it is considered prone so you have advantage on your attacks against it oh shit okay so roll your first attack damage okay so the first hit as you jam down you go to stir it you hit right at the base of the skull and the neck breaks immediately but you feel like you still have to go through the motion so you still stir inside even though it's not living the body's limp and being pushed around in a circle you're like (yelling in disgust) (yelling) about like that so that's your first strike yes he's very dead there are two sleeping and there is one that was first struck by you with your crossbow that was wounded but it's still standing and its blade's out you do okay what's your movement actually yes you would have enough because you are quicker than the other so you have enough speed to get right up to him go ahead and make your second attack no yep this one sees you crush his friend and stir him up a bit and prepares itself as you rush toward darts out of the way and dodge-rolls beyond your attack no effect all right so that ends eden's turn skak you're up first go for it he is yes yeah between the damage he already took-- this one the arrow strikes right in the abdomen it clutches it gets the axe up to its side and you see it with its final bit of strength trying to strike a blow toward your olog friend over there but crumples to the ground and bleeds out from its abdomen okay make an attack with advantage it's an auto-crit because it is incapacitated no it is a crit it's an auto-crit because it's right there actually you wouldn't even have to roll because when it's incapacitated no attack rolls have advantage you're right and within five feet it's a critical hit so yeah you did hit and you have a crit (snoring) (impact) scattered gallagher performance all of you are like (splatter) the one sleeping now has this section of hand that slopped onto its head pulls it in cuddles with the disembodied orc arm make an acrobatics check all right so as you leap off and watch one of three taut points on it vanish you flap your arms really fast to try and maneuver through the air you manage to hit some tension on their side and roll off you only suffer three points of bludgeoning damage as you roll on the ground as you land i want you to roll a constitution saving throw all right so as you roll and land the sleeping powder seems to have worn off the one that's on the ground clutching and sucking on the thumb of the disembodied uruk arm goes (sniffing and grunting) (confused noises) (cry of alarm) make an athletics check natural 19 as you go to grab he goes (yelling) pulls away you can attempt to make another if you want you get two attacks you can make one per attack 13 yeah no he's like (grunting) pushes away from you twice this slimy little orc is now freaked out make an athletics check it's like (slurping sounds) ten nope it's like grabbing the soap boop boop boop it keeps slipping out of your grasp and it's crawling on the ground 25 okay yeah that'll do it it slips past each one crawling on the ground (heavy breathing) (clunk) ugh you get the ankle and you pull it back in slides onto his back and is like (panicked yelling) underneath this giant olog body covered in armor that's towering over it looking up at you arby like-- somebody make an intimidation check after this display the uruk on the ground goes (bursts into laughter) what is this what the forcs really (giggling) just kill me (shrieking) my name's borg please stop it i'm borg laura & i know ur-gram (stuttering) i could tell you i could show you oh (groaning) okay i could show you so just know ur-gram is strange he's a fanatic bit of a creepy individual this uruk which at a close glance is small it's borderline goblin in how thin and tiny it is sits up on his feet (wheezing) a fanatic ur-gram is near death once he was now works for some tark who walks like the wraiths do the bright lord he is marks all his gobs with his hand he does i don't question though ur-gram can break any of us i've seen it i have that's good the bright lord aye i've seen him around he's just some stupid man-filth i already said man-filth please don't borg is asking you no one (whimpering) well didn't bend me didn't ask i'll show you sure take your rest okay (muffled whimpering) (yelps of pain) you break a few bones in the process all right so you guys all take a short rest you can use any hit dice that are currently unspent you get your ki back you get your action surge back all right at the end of this rest as you're laying back you hear this silent whimpering as borg's like (whimpering) i need to get up first (muffled) blah i need to get up first (gasping and heavy breathing) as you guys continue eastward under the cover of night having crossed over the apex of this mountain range you descend down the treacherous paths and cliffs below a few hours downward continuing with the pushing of borg ahead of you he begins to continuously glance out in the darkness ahead of you until eventually you come around one bend through this small valley path that's been carved through years and years of heavy rains and wind that have burrowed this small walkway through these big cliff-sides you turn around the corner and you can see immediately about a dozen or so dotted lights in the distance the dark maybe a quarter-mile away there borg goes that there that's where he is that's where ur-gram and the tark have been preparing maybe i don't know i've only had to go outside of it oh well i've been inside but they let me in don't think they're going to do that for you i mean-- he looks down at himself and looks around they gave us these he tugs at the tunic that he has under his ramshackle piecemeal armor there's this soft grey material that has a dull grey handprint that's pulled across the front he goes maybe this well he gives them like a-- don't think so what's your strength modifier your strength modifier is five you take six points of bludgeoning damage to the face as your jaw actually disconnects from one side and (cracking sound) yeah yeah he's totally lying he has no idea he watched you slap the shit out of your friend and is amused by it i can hear you oh oh i could do that i could help you in make a deception check he's like that's very generous so then to ur-gram come on make a medicine check 14 it takes a minute but eventually (cracking) it's sore it's swollen your face looks disproportionate right okay good to know follow me begins to carefully dart around you guys progress for about 20 or so minutes before you reach the very base of this mountain it's now evened out and you're in this valley where this small fortress is the closer you get i want you to make a perception check all of you guys all right darin perception all right some decent rolls all around okay you guys can see on the other side of this wide valley where the torchlights encircle a fenced walled encampment a single ramshackle watchtower marks the center of the interior of this large sharpened pike-like wall the back half of the wall is buttressed against the mountain base across the valley from you vanishing into a large cavern so it's not a full encirclement you see the wall encircles around the base of the mountain and each side ends at the mountain there's an actual natural cavern that the base of it hides in shadow you had the 22 you also hear faintly off in the distance this (snuffling and growling) you've heard this sound before it's kept you up at night whenever the caragors in their cages were particularly rambunctious it sounds like a caragor as soon as you hear it you also hear a (alert yelp) a second one not far from it goes (snuffling) yeah but like near you maybe 40 feet from you at the moment no trees you're in mordor right now i mean there are jagged rocks part of the terrain itself is a series of broken shale and large rock faces that jut out of the ground from seismic activity okay make a stealth check okay so you watch as skak disappears behind a rock what are you guys doing okay make a stealth check with disadvantage okay you watch as arby nods follows suit right behind where skak is the rock's almost the size of arby so you see this outline of arby clutching this rock and trying to act quiet as the armor (clanking) make a stealth check as you climb a little bit of the rock face on one side of this pathway that's carved into the mountain base here you glance up you can see the faint bit of moonlight that breaks through one of the nearby clouds you can see the outer rim of two fully-grown caragors that are currently walking maybe 15 feet from each other a dual hunting scenario they're both like (sniffing and grunting) on the ground and they're smelling for any sort of possible prey that might be in the vicinity (bell clanging) the bell is now ringing in her hand the caragors at this point (snarling) they both go jumping and leaping in toward where the source of the bell sound was make a strength check the bell arcs behind where you guys were right it arcs off behind you and you watch as one large caragor nearly 15 feet from end to end leaps from the top of the cliff down into the ravine behind you the rock ravine where you were and pounces on right where the bell landed you hear it ping (crushing) with an impact you see rocks get thrown as it scrapes across the ground and it tears where the sound source was it sits there tearing at it the other one comes right up to the edge to inspect inside right over where you are it hasn't quite noticed you right now as you guys are all standing still the bell is quickly being noticed to not be anything fleshy it's about maybe five feet above you right now sure go ahead and roll an attack you have advantage on this strike since it's unaware of your position 26 hits yeah 11 points of damage nice so as the one that-- its snout kind of creeped over the edge you can see its teeth are this thick underbite of its jaw pulling open as it's trying to take in the air both through its nose and its mouth (snarling) at which point out of the darkness this giant maul head slams right into its snout and it backs up briefly and as that happens and you pull the maul back it glances down with this look of absolute hatred and death in its eyes (roars) you do get a second attack because you did take the action on this one and at this point the other one spins around from where the bell was hearing the pained sound of its ally 17 hits 12 points of damage all righty so as it's gearing up over the side you take the maul and slam it again this time it moves its head to the side and it hits the side of its neck it's a heavy hit and it takes the brunt of it but it's so big i mean you're pretty big as an olog-hai it's probably at least two or more times the mass of your body and on that note i would like everybody to roll initiative please as these two caragor are now bearing down on you in this ravine oh okay oh nice (laughs) yeah these guys don't seem very fast all right mozuu you're up first there's the one that's up behind you on the path maybe about 15 20 feet from you and there's the one that's right above the edge right now that she slammed twice in the face what are you going to do all right so you pull forth your war pick and you're going to go ahead and strike which one okay it's a little high for you right now because of her size she can barely reach it you'd have to try and make your way up either arby or climb part of the cliff side up to you make an athletics check oh snap okay so using arby's body as a ramp you begin to leap up from shoulder to back to shoulder the top of her head and jump in the air warpick in the sky as you scream to bring it bearing down on the first caragor before you (laughs) all righty so make an attack roll against it 16 hits go ahead and roll for this so yes 1d8 plus three and then you add an additional 2d6 thunder damage to the target 12 points of damage all right so as you slam the war pick right into the front of its snout it jams into one nostril and tears through across the side of its face releasing this gout of dark purplish-red blood and as the impact hits there's a burst of energy the sheer force of your anger as you scream in its face scares it back and it blows about ten feet behind you and is knocked prone it rolled a natural four plus four that's eight and i believe your spell dc is 11 right this caragor now gets thrown back ten feet and is knocked prone on the ground on its side it's trying to snap around and get its feet any sort of purchase to get back up on to the ground but currently it's open that ends your turn okay so skak you're up no you'd have get up all right go for it it just turned around (growls) 12 okay that does not hit you turn around and you fire and it-- i'll let you move around the rock where you are and try and hide okay good to know all right that ends your turn it's now their turn so the one that was knocked prone gets up off the ground ten feet away it still has enough movement as you're standing now on the shoulders of arby it's going to go ahead and-- let's see it takes a five-foot step back and goes into a 15-foot leap right towards you it's a deadly leap (snarls) it lunges towards you yeah i need both mozuu and arby to make strength or dexterity saving throw your choice you succeed you do not all right so here we go 14 points of bludgeoning and slashing damage to you mozuu and you are knocked prone as it lands on top of you knocking you off of arby's shoulders you are now on the ground with it on top of you going (snarls) and it's tearing and biting at you as you are currently pinned to the floor turnabout's fair play you take seven points of damage arby and you are not knocked prone or thrown off you manage to keep your weight there however it's partially standing on you now its hind legs are up on your back and it's using you to hold itself as it's currently putting all of its weight on mozuu the other one that was shot at by skak is going to go ahead and rush forward and it's going to go ahead and make a deadly leap as well let's see all that going on with that space it's going to have to go after eden i need you to go ahead and make a strength or dexterity saving throw your choice 21 all right okay you take six points of bludgeoning and slashing damage together and you are not knocked prone it doesn't pin you in the space you just manage to pull out of the way but it's right up in your face now and your back's against the rock that he's hiding behind there's your friends and the other caragor right behind you over your shoulders and this one is right in front of you right now slashing and snarling at you that's going to end their turn arby you're up okay that's the one you've hit before so go for it 26 hits all righty so that first hit slams into its side you hit it again you hear the crunch one shoulder blade seems to almost buckle a little bit it's looking pretty hurt but it's still standing there that hits 14 all righty and with that you slam up your maul a second time it actually catches it right underneath the jaw and forces its head to snap up so fast that its spine seems to break into place and with a (whines) it falls limp the entirety of its weight sliding off of your shoulders and onto mozuu who is now prone and pinned underneath it okay so taking a little bit there shoving it off to the side you rush up to the one that's right in the face of eden it's a quick jaunt that hits what all right seven points of damage you rush up and swing at it this time it brings its head back and manages to deflect some of the blow with the side of its face not quite doing as much damage as you'd like make up for that there you go 25 points of damage so while it deflects the first blow as it turns its head back to strike at you you put your foot up and hold it right in its jaw to keep it from getting away you use that to aim it up and whack right up the side of its temple it rings its bell and you watch as it pulls away the slobber and blood dripping from its jaws shaking its head back and forth from the pain you just inflicted i believe that ends your turn end of arby's turn brings it to you eden 23 hits you get two attacks and then you can use your flurry you can so you get two more attacks 15 just barely hits so it can't take attacks of opportunity there you go perfect that ends your turn eden mozuu you're up currently prone and pinned under the dead body of a caragor yes you may are you going to attempt to pull your way out or are you just waiting for someone to help you you're holding your action for someone to aid you hear and see out of the corner of your eye you especially see it because you're right behind the rock and you see his head and shoulders are right there like help holding your action for someone to help you that brings us to skak's turn it's an action to poison a weapon it's more of a preparation thing oh shit roll your dice and then add the modifiers after you double it yeah they've both been bashing it 26 points of damage all right yeah as you peek out of hiding you see it snapping and snarling at both of your friends over on the side you take a moment and slow your breathing (heartbeats) and release the crossbow bolt you watch behind as it streaks forward between your friends the caragor turns opening its jaw to snap over arby and it goes right in the back of the throat up into the brain and it collapses to the ground no longer moving since you're not in immediate danger it takes you a minute or so you all manage to push this giant caragor corpse off of mozuu's body you're sore you're crushed you're sweaty and covered in blood but you're now standing make a perception check 21 he is quite a ways down the walkway sprinting away you're going to use another ki point with your speed and double dash as he's sprinting (heavy panting) about a minute later or so you catch up right behind him and he's within grasp of you he hasn't noticed you he's just eyes on the prize right towards the fortress make an athletics check to grapple him 17 you grab him by the back of the head and he gets yanked out from under his feet and slams into the ground you're still clutching him you pick him up he's dangling now from your giant olog mitts i was running from the caragors self-preservation mate yes of course don't worry make a perception check you see him grabbing him by the head and pulling him in and you see a bit of a struggle roll an attack roll damage with sneak attack (laughter) as you're holding him don't worry we've got this all right we're going to make our way inside i'm going to ask you right now to make an initiative roll to see how fast you are at healing him versus how fast he's bleeding out from the wound you finish applying the bandages you've pulled out the bolt and you have the body there (cough) he rolled a three just borg you guys approach as eden is cradling this freshly bandaged goblin okay make an intimidation check he goes right point making i'm good all right all right so as you guys slowly begin to encroach upon the outer elements of this fortress the points of torchlight burning in these braziers along the top side of it you can see guards walking back and forth along the edges shortbows at the side nocked and ready in case any sign of danger happens you can see a front-- actually for you guys that are closest go ahead and make a perception check all righty okay so as you all stare off and it's about as much as you can make out you however skak looking ahead you can see one there's a main entrance there's two large eight-foot-wide doors that are currently closed on the north side of the wall you also see what happens to be a muck-covered mud hole that's towards the south side where the wall meets the mountain where you can see it's a little swampy and it looks like some of this thick muck and mud meets up to the side of the wall there well i've seen it aye not intentionally it's the shrak hole (groaning) i could show you (coughs) its wrapping is all around the face and one eye-- it was already swollen from earlier and is now-- he's a wrecked-looking goblin i don't know all right so i want you guys to all make stealth checks to make your way around that hole without being seen yes and that's disadvantage for you arby unfortunately because you have heavy armor on (high-pitched) well roll a second time no it's a stealth check okay as you guys quietly make your way over to the shrak hole you approach the base of the gate there and you hear a voice above you go hey what are you doing you look up and there's three archers that all have their bows notched on you going what the hell are you-- oh we're gathering for the alchemist getting some more prime shrak for his boomy balls yeah he's going to attempt to make a deception-- oh not bad actually let's see if they-- rolling against myself here all right who are them what's the forcs make a deception check one of them starts whispering to the other one and the one that he's whispering to nods and goes and grabs one of the torches and starts going over towards one of the unlit braziers you've seen these before they're used usually as a beacon a warning a signal for any sort of undue-- he looks like he intends to light it go ahead and roll for an attack no it is not a surprise attack it's probably about 15 feet high you weren't-- oh you were pretty stealthed the rest weren't so yeah it is now a sneak attack 16 to hit yeah that hits the archer all right so the one that's walking towards the brazier falls off the wall on the side and slams into the mud there and the other two archers immediately go-- and they both pull and they're going to both fire arrows down one of them is going to fire at you-- actually they're both going to fire at you because you killed their friend you revealed yourself they suck though-- that's an 11 yeah and a ten so you duck out on both sides and they both go for secondary arrows and begin running towards the brazier themselves now what are you guys doing well yeah but horizontal distance-- we'll say height for this what's your strength modifier right it doubles it so you get (grunts) i'll say you barely-- because of your height because you are an olog you barely get your fingers up on the top go ahead and make a strength saving throw to try and pull yourself up you drop back down it's just too high make an investigation check if you want to no it's a long rest a 12 you find a small rock in your hand it's really small make an attack roll (laughs) it arcs over the wall all right go for it and they're going to go again 15 just barely hits it's technically not sneak attack because you've already hit them ten damage okay so one of them gets hit and he's still standing and he's going to whip around and try to fire back at you the other one that's running past is going to go ahead and pull out a torch and try to light it all right so that ends your turn they're going to go one is going to take another shot at you there we go that is a 24 to hit oh shit that's right you didn't so you go okay so you go ahead and make a-- as you dive into it make an investigation check to try and feel your way through you disappear into it and writhe around a bunch to try and reach out for something it's very taut even your uruk form is having a hard time pulling underneath indeed (laughs) all right so you-- yes that would be seven points of piercing damage reduced to three and the other guy manages to light the brazier the light goes bright the signal has been lit what are you guys doing make an attack roll this is just your strength modifier you're not proficient in bodies eight (laughs) you slam it against the wall it slides down and hits the ground you hear this horrible crunching sound as a number of previously unbroken bones are now freshly broken in the dead body you have another attack if you want to walk up and try it again okay make another attack roll with a crumpled body you release a little too early and it (heavy impact) hits the wall right next to you one of the arms tears and flies off against the mud you liquefied his insides at this point well as you dive in it pushes you out the other side you get shoved out plopped out covered in shrak and you look around immediately you can see as you wipe your eyes off the shrak everybody is now starting to look around at the signal and begin to grab their weapons and start preparing for an incursion you dive into it you get halfway in-- this is a very small space underneath and you're a very large olog i'm going to need you to make either an athletics check or an acrobatics check to try and push through your choice 19 you push through and watch as the bottom of the wall splinters and breaks but you manage to make your way through and now you stand up behind mozuu a good number of feet taller than him also covered in shrak and you both now look around at this chaos happening what are you doing all right you dive in the space has been opened thankfully you follow through they paved the path you glide through and now it's just you and your friend borg who's looking at the archers well the archers the one that's with the torch is going to go ahead and try and take another shot they're both taking a shot one's going to be at you and one's going to be at you now that you guys are on that side against you that is a 21 you take-- ooh nine points of piercing damage well you used it from last time so it returns so you have it back again you can use it-- yeah okay it's reduced to four points of piercing damage and then one against you is a 14 it breaks off the armor they're both firing arrows down at you all right so what are you guys doing you glide underneath as they fire at you you slip under you're back there with borg dives in like slowly wades into it (groans) and goes under and pushes his way through without an issue okay as you guys get up on the other side you can now see about 40 to 50 various uruk have now gathered at the base of the wall where you're standing they're all armored and ready their weapons are drawn and you are completely surrounded on the interior of this wall nothing but liquid shrak at your back as you all stand there but they're all keeping at bay you watch as a hand comes up behind the crowd and goes hold everyone was like-- they are ready to tear at you but they begin to part at the center and you watch with heavy steps as an olog-hai approaches with a giant mutated underbite with tusks that reach up past the nostril the eyes peek through from heavily scarred muscle tissue where a face once existed but has since been torn and not healed very well over you see clutching a giant greataxe in its grasp what you assume to be ur-gram the face-eater who's approached and goes who who enters my home make a deception check the bright lord you say then stand at me walk up and prove you bear the mark at this point you see ur-gram is taken aback by this response and glances over his shoulders he steps back and you hear a voice from behind him go let me see this orc bring him before me and as ur-gram steps aside you see a human male standing with long somewhat-tattered dark hair beard towards the base of the chin wearing leather and hide armor and bits of chainmail beneath a dark cloak with a single long blade extended to one side all the rest of the various uruks around the area separate and back away as they do you see a familiar flash in their eyes that strange gray-white light that you saw when you first had your fortress attacked the human man walks forward you say you came this far for the bright lord then come stand before me be marked as you say your request as he looks down upon this snivelling uruk his hand protrudes forward and you see for a second the outer image of his form begin to shimmer and for a moment you see a familiar sight you've only seen towards the outskirts of the dead waste and swamps on the western side of mordor you see spiritual energy pull out of him and you see for a brief instant a wraith-like form of some long-dead elf that marks the exterior of his body as the hand reaches forward this voice echoes around come may you join the rest of this army takes the hand and places it against the side of mozuu's face i need you all to roll initiative right now okay you rolled a 12 initiative all right so we have-- all righty oh wow you are dead even with the tark okay all right so top of the round arby as you go charging forward right as the hand reaches to grab the side of mozuu's face what are you going to do make a shove attack or try and push him out of the way okay then making a shove attack for your first strike i believe i need you to make an athletics check i'm checking here it doesn't happen too often 20 okay yep contested against athletics or acrobatics all righty weirdly enough you manage to get in fast enough your large olog-hai form (heavy footsteps) and slam with your shoulder into this tark he goes flying off spinning in the air and landing barely catching himself as he skids back about ten feet or so looks up at you and still the wraith form is on the outside the eyes flash with this vibrant scary white light and the wraith form fits back into the body as the tark stands to his feet the blade at his side and goes very well so you've chosen death all right so you still have another attack if you want to take it 26 hits (laughs) 14 points of damage nice all right so as you hit him you hear a ringing out behind him the voice of the face-eater himself ur-gram says gravewalker smash the invaders all right so at this point the gravewalker who's now up in front of you takes the hit and glares back at you with the burning white eyes he's going to go ahead and make two strikes on you with urfael his sword that is a 21 and that is seven points of slashing damage and 19 that is six points of slashing damage and then he is going to go ahead and attempt a shadow strike attack as it strikes you twice with the sword sidesteps to the side and looks around at you and that is a 16 what's your armor class 16 it hits you as you watch the gravewalker suddenly vanishes from his place a streak of vibrant white light shoots between the two of you and appears right in front of you before striking down that's an 18 to hit all right you suffer five points of-- i'm sorry nine points of slashing damage and four points of radiant damage well it's against the whole attack correct down to six it would be all right and that's going to end the gravewalker's turn all right ending that skak you're up (laughs) okay roll go for it no what was once an ally is now no longer-- roll for damage so as you fire the crossbow bolt you watch as eden-- so you spend a ki point and go ahead and roll an attack with it it's considered proficient yeah if you reduce the damage past what it did you get to throw it back at him yeah that hits so go and roll damage so it's a d8 plus your dexterity yeah so d8 plus four 12 points of piercing damage no you already used it (laughs) good to know all right at the end of your turn-- you still have a bonus action if you want to try something okay so you move behind the gravewalker all right at the end of your turn he's going to use two of his legendary actions to try a dominate on you yes so as you reach behind-- it's an 18 so he reaches behind and as he's still staring forward grasps the side of your face and you feel this burning singeing sensation make a wisdom saving throw 13 the mark the brand of the gravewalker now burned into your face you see the majesty of the bright lord before you and you understand this is the one to follow so whereas you may have decided to change allegiance before it's solidified now you are working for the gravewalker all right that ends that turn mozuu you're up the rest of the uruks are stepping back and watching this they're just enjoying the fray (laughs) so you stay there and still kneeling 20 feet away all righty that's your whole-- (evil laughter) perfect all right that ends mozuu's turn eden you're up having just thrown the bolt back at skak all right so-- you're going to run you're like-- dive back into the shrak hole underneath it's easy enough for you to push past now since you made way earlier you pop out on the other side and start bolting away all right at the end of your turn the gravewalker's going to go ahead and use his last legendary action-- seeing you dart away he's going to turn back towards you he's going to go ahead and the blade goes away for a second and pulls his bow azkar out and pulls back an arrow releases it actually that's a 12 rolled really low it slips off and you're unmoving unbreakable even all right back to the top it's now arby and the gravewalker's turn all right you rush maul swinging in the air go for it 11 you go and swing and you watch as the form shimmies by and he dodges right out of the way preternaturally fast okay (laughs) the second swing goes wide and for a second you're sure you made contact but in the space where the hammer goes you watch as the gravewalker stands back into place you sow chaos and invite it bow or crumple before your bright lord the choice matters not for death has already found me once and lost and he's going to go ahead and attempt a wraith stun attack against you that is 23 to hit all right you take ten points of radiant damage by ten so it hits you and you resist the damage but i still need you to make a constitution saving throw okay you feel the impact the wraith energies but your physical form being a tough olog-hai you resist the stunning effect of the strike and push through it no stun on you whatsoever and then he's going to go ahead and follow up with two more attacks with urfael as the bow's been put by the side he's going to swing twice with the blade against you that is a 15 it just slides off your armor second strike that's cocked natural one so he swings a second time and you actually catch the blade in your hand you feel it like cutting into your grip a little bit but you tighten as you stare down at the gravewalker unmoved at this threatening presence that's looking up at you like it's only an inevitability all right so that's going to go ahead and end their turn skak you're up sure you glance off to the side and one of the ologs who's off to the side there has chains around the chest you can see maybe it was more of the physical-handy ologs as opposed to warrior looks at you with a nod make a persuasion check 19 the olog picks you up and gives you an alley-oop into the air yeah easily enough you arc up make an acrobatics check to try and land your feet on the wall you land on the edge of the wall and you glance up just passing you can see eden darting away make an attack i will say he's not aware of your presence sure i'll allow it 18 points of piercing damage so crossbow bolt catches you in the back of the shoulder blades right where the spine meets them your body tenses for a second all right so when you get to your turn you're bolting back all right so mozuu it's back up to your turn i mean pretty much everyone else is gone okay you use that as your action all right at the top it is arby and talion's turn so what are you doing currently yeah sure all right go ahead and make-- this would be an athletics versus athletics 23 as you attempt to do it he pulls the blade from your grasp cuts your hand a little bit but nothing too major so you have one more attack 20 hits all right 12 points of damage this time the gravewalker gets taken off his feet a little bit he rolls a little bit just around the side and gets back up to his feet maybe five feet almost ten feet from you blade's still out looks at you looks at the surrounding scenarios seems to become somewhat impressed by the fact that you're still fighting in the midst of such immeasurable danger there you go at which point the gravewalker turns his back on you and steps towards mozuu and says then prove to me prove to me you have what it takes and reaches down and grabs your face this time finally making contact go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw you can opt to not resist it if you'd like to do you want to resist it or you want to let it happen then you don't need to make a saving throw then that being the case the brand burns in the side of your face you watch as mozuu's eyes flare with a vibrant energy and as it fades you now see that indeed this prophecy you spoke earlier seems to be true you are now as the brand is there you glance back and see the pittance that is the existence of your previous allies and the bright lord as you stand up goes kill for me and looks back towards arby and with that he's going to go ahead and pull back azkar and take two arrow shots at you that is a 23 and a 19 all right that is 11 points of piercing damage and seven points of piercing damage both arrows slam into your armor you can feel the plates break and crumble these are not normal arrows not with the strength that they're being tossed at you that's going to end the gravewalker's turn skak you're up you can see eden running back you want to try and hide first well if you can manage to hide and move and he's not aware of where you are i'll allow it okay so make a stealth check make a perception check if you like eden so right as he's running he glances up and catches you skak make your attack no sneak attack on this one unfortunately do you have any ki left to throw it back you need to spend a ki what so as he's running and just catches it all right ending skak's turn mozuu you're up all right make an athletics check against arb-uruk you make an athletics check as well as it's opposed so you leap onto the front of her which by the way you're small in comparison you're like this spider climbing up the body up to the throat go ahead and make an attack 19 armor class is 18 roll a d4 plus your strength modifier so you take five points of piercing damage as mozuu begins biting chunks out of your throat i'll consider leaping as part of it all right eden you're up as you ran and then came right back you come up from underneath and you're out of the shrak hole and you see now mozuu latched onto arb-uruk biting into the throat go for it the bright lord is not that far from you you can get to the bright lord you're pretty fast go for it 20 to hit that hits mozuu i think so 12 points of bludgeoning damage as out of nowhere eden rushes forward and slams you in the side of the body almost knocking you off of arb-uruk but not quite strong enough to do so that hits roll damage again six more points of bludgeoning damage and you have your bonus action still if you want to i believe so yeah 13 the third and final hit you manage to deflect it with your with your arm it makes no impact there ending eden's turn up to you and the gravewalker sure go for it yeah you tear him off go ahead and make an attack roll you don't get the proficiency bonus on this but you still get your strength bonus 18 hits the gravewalker his ac is 17 i'll say for this one roll a d6 and add your strength modifier you don't get to reroll your damage roll because he's not considered-- sure you know what sure i'll let him be a two-handed weapon yeah i'll allow it so ten points of bludgeoning damage to both you and the gravewalker after the hit mozuu goes limp in your hand and you're flailing him around in the grasp the gravewalker takes the hit looks up at you he's going to go ahead and make one strike with urfael that is 20 all right you take eight points of slashing damage and that is a 22 to hit you take 12 points of slashing damage you're unconscious all right as you fall unconscious and collapse to the ground he reaches down and grasps the side of your face and you feel this urge of energy come up from underneath and as your eyes flare open you see the burning vibrant eyes of the wraith within the gravewalker say stand and join me do you want to resist or not make a will save to resist if you want make a wisdom saving throw and you do brought back to the brink there the gravewalker stands ahead of you as you resist he goes fine i gave you a choice spins the blade around and takes you out from that point yeah skak your turn up on the edge of the wall no actually yeah he would have been in melee with her which means he's right next to talion so yeah it would be because you've gone since last time you may make a perception check all right well you do now that he doesn't see you 18 hits go ahead and roll damage oh my god that's so great i love it i love it so much all right that ends your turn skak mozuu's unconscious mozuu's pretty gone eden you're up yeah all across that hits go ahead and roll a d6 plus damage plus all right so five damage he's going to use a legendary action at the end of your turn to do dominate on you he goes one mark for another uruk brother reaches forward to grasp at you natural 20 make a wisdom saving throw i'll say disadvantage on the wisdom saving throw because of the natural 20 as the brand of the gravewalker burns into your face suddenly you see now the vision of glory the possible downfall of the dark lord and a new beginning under the bright lord here in mordor and as he pulls the hand away now the fray has come to a calm the villains and the current scenario from there and now your perspective now ended the rest of the uruk begin to gather around face-eater ur-gram comes up behind and the gravewalker looks about to invite those that survived the fray now under his grasp come we must salvage the shreds i mean to carve my way northwest you watch now as a red-orange flare off in the distance up in the clouds signifies the volcanic explosion within mount doom far far away stand at my side orcs for we
