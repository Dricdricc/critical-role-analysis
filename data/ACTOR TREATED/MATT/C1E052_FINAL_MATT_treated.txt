it's usually sam all right well then let's go ahead and bring this down now to get in the mood for tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] oh sorry coriolanus thank you and that is where we're picking up so-- holy shit what the-- what please tell me that was a gift from somebody inspiration granted and immediately taken away that's the first step of the process the pants come soon i can't even that's a thing all righty so with that we are going into the realm of battle let's go ahead and kick on the proper music for this so with vox machina currently on the rooftops here and hiding within the bottom of this building we have the four archers that have appeared on the rooftop of the margrave's house we have most of the individuals that are surrounding this along with the few innocents which just for the sake of appearance here i will go ahead and attempt to mark with a few markers so you know who you're looking for innocents-wise no you're not not anymore all right so the red markers are going to act as markers for the innocent just so you're aware percy's over there all righty so that all being the case guys as grog shouted at this moment the individuals in the center of the square start looking around confused not knowing where to come from at this moment a few of them manage to catch up a glance at the individuals that are on the rooftops i need everyone to roll initiative along with you grog because combat has begun again at this point at the top all of you guys this has started 'because he's fucking evil' is that what you said all right so for the sake of this one we have 25 to 20 21 okay so we have-- let's see all right 20 to 15 all righty 15 to ten pike getting into the double-digits a lot here i'm keeping track of guys all right so the surprise round affects all the archers it affects everyone except for these four individuals or these two individuals with the clubs and these two women here with big swords and kevdak so top of the round vex the second story does actually this one was supposed to go this way for the entrance point there all right so you are currently now looking out the side of the window right no one's seen you at this point putting a green on him for the hunter's mark hold your action until-- okay so that finishes your turn vax you're up you are by a door you're inside the house right now the door is technically partially ajar because you guys did slip in okay that'll end your current actions the archers are surprised they do not go it is kevdak's turn kevdak sees you shouting out he rolled a natural 20 on his initiative yeah i was like man all right let's start this right they had wheaton come in and touch all my stuff all right so he's going to go ahead and seeing you shout like this he looks about for a second he's going to continue his rage he glances about looks over and he sees nothing immediately on the rooftops but looks down at this individual now shouting out for help before him prostrate and he gives you a glance and says well this seems real familiar doesn't it strongjaw at which point he's going to go ahead and take two of his reckless attacks against you that's going to be a 28 to hit yeah second attack is a 30 to hit no these are not great weapon master you take 30 points of slashing damage reduced to 15 and two points of necrotic damage because it's not reduced and second one's going to be 22 points of slashing damage reduced to 11 and then five points of necrotic on top of that you might have to get a little bit closer to make sure that he can hear you what're you going to do sam okay you step to the very edge of the rooftop here we'll say for the sake of this right there just like that on your shirt as he brings around his axe for a second swing he hears that and glances over his shoulder and sees this shiny gnome butt up on the top continuing the swing though to attack go ahead and reduce the damage using your cutting words uh-huh so you take ten points of slashing damage from that strike oh you're wielding mythcarver so his next saving throw is at disadvantage right because you're not currently wielding your weapon kevdak's going to go ahead and take a step back and glance over at you as he's going to move his fingers up and point towards the roof and you see a bunch of the other entities and archers whoosh shift their attention over in your direction sam all right that finishes kevdak's turn scanlan you're up next actually you do get an attack of opportunity on him with your fist because you're not holding your warhammer right now i mean it's your strength modifier plus your proficiency modifier 13 no you punch his back and it just hits off his muscle all right sam you're up where are you holding it no they're all the type of people that would be at all times wielding something at their side there are two individuals that you do notice there is this one here and there is greenbeard right there and they both appear to have some sort of a quarterstaff-type implement but everything else is either bladed or giant clubs or some sort of big melee weapon they are yes on kevdak oh boy you would yeah all right hold person for a minute wisdom saving throw for the duration okay with disadvantage yes that is true kevdak all right he rolled a 19 and an eight taking the eight that brings it to a ten so that's a failure on him (cheering) you can in a moment we have to figure out if the other guy makes his save he rolls a natural one aw man the rest of these people are going to be real pissed yes at the end of each of his turns the target can make another wisdom saving throw and paralyzed for those who are aware what paralyzation does a paralyzed creature is incapacitated and cannot speak automatically fails strength and dexterity saving throws attacks rolls have advantage and any attack that hits the target is a critical hit if it's within five feet of the creature you do you can duck behind the other side of this roof if you'd like i mean it's more the casting time you can still move away once you've cast the spell and hold it there and that finishes your turn scanlan grog you're up you watch as he steps away from you points up and all the archers turn towards that everyone else looks over at the rooftop and you hear a cacophony of voices around growling before kevdak takes another step and (grunts) and you see the gleaming ass of scanlan in the distance the high noonday sun bouncing off of his pale sun-dappled gnomish skin these two round globes of victory staring down from the rooftop do you want to pick up your weapon first or nope okay oh right because you held your actions so up to you yep all right so we have now vex taking your shots yes and they all have advantage because he's paralyzed this is bad for kevdak but we'll see how it works still raging so everything's half-damage yeah that does yep yeah they all hit 28 reduced to 14 okay okay that reduces to eight all the arrows strike true thump-thump-thump but still each one is only piercing the flesh so far he's generally so dense in his musculature each impact is not having the same satisfying (impact) sound you're used to but that ends your held action and it is now your turn oh right that was the sky sentinel go for it take a second attack okay yeah that's going to hit 14 okay 14 damage to him greenbeard is currently stuck there in place the arrow sinks into his robe and you don't even see the impact it absorbs into the cloth and he goes ah and you hear the escaping air from the impact but he can't actually move at this point you'd better all right you're up correct so you're moving up into the doorway who are you attacking 60 feet you'd okay yeah you can get right into there and probably still hit him from there because you have sharpshooter you don't have the second increment range go for it that hits 37 and half of that is going to put it at 18 you had the held-- a held action is just your action well the idea being that when you hold your action you have an action that you hold until it triggers the bonus action's a whole different thing that you have to take on your turn yes essentially you have your action and your bonus action holding your action means you hold that one bit of it but your turn still continues past it over here you can certain try it (laughter) make an acrobatics check 30 you manage to make it up to the top no you used your action technically you wouldn't be able to move at this point even but i'm letting you do that usually your move it's a little weird so yeah trinket's just chilling in the house (sad bear noise) all righty so that ends your held action now grog you're up okay go ahead and make an athletics check with advantage because you are raging oof you yank the bloodaxe from his grip i mean-- let's check on that because i don't know if it's an attack-action-based because you didn't take an attack action last turn you used your action to pull it away looking at that right now the berserker is here let me see yeah it's a bonus action so you could if you wanted to the weapon isn't attuned to you so it would just act as a regular axe possibly like on his left arm sure you're going to be-- it's going to-- okay so you're raging advantage well no reckless attack would be the advantage if you wanted to well you have advantage against attacks with him anyway because he's paralyzed i will say it'll have-- okay you'll have advantage on the attack but i will say it's a general minus five to the attack just because it's a very specific called shot go for it all right go ahead and roll damage it's a d12 and add your strength modifier poor d12 strength modifier which would be three five whoosh you hack the blade and it sinks quite a bit into the arm right above the elbow you can see as you pull it out a bit of bone is exposed from it but the arm is still intact it wasn't enough damage to go through but he's like (stifled yell) because you were within five feet so yes so double the dice so what'd you roll on the dice so four so instead it would be seven damage still not enough but you do do a significant amount of damage to his left arm his now-open hand's gripping nothing actually the one hand was holding the axe and the other one was pointing up so he's like (strained sound) looking at you right now as the blood begins to seep out of the fresh wound on his left arm you can move three more spaces so yeah three that's where you can get right there okay that ends your turn surprise back percy you're up (laughs) cast hex on the asshole okay that's the thing with hex all right so yeah you watch as grog walks around him grog's shadow seems to stretch out from his form reach up and wrap itself around almost merging with the tattoos across his torso the actual bear tattoo almost seems to be almost covered with shadow which way are you going about here yes you can you could i'll move this board a little bit so you guys can see better his left arm you do not have a view on it right away i would say from your perspective on the rooftop because he was turned this way and is facing this way you would have a big ol' view of his back and shoulders on this arm okay go for it you have advantage on the attack because he's paralyzed you have advantage on that and then you have disadvantage because it's a called shot plus minus five you would if you hit what's the first range increment for the pistol yeah okay gun go for it double the dice and then add the modifier to it 32 points of damage okay half of that into 16 (gunshot) you watch as the blast hits into the side of his arm the arm actually hyperextends and part of the bone shoots out the side and he goes and screams out the arm does not you know it looks like it's in a rough place with the disadvantage you got advantage because he's paralyzed yeah you're right you're right hold person man nasty too late 24 points of damage so minus that to 12 this is the same elbow (gunshot) you see now the arm actually is dangling now from some sort of sinew and bone that is barely keeping it on at this point that hits lower that to 11 okay this shot hits the elbow again actually destroying a big portion of the upper forearm it's now essentially but a single leftover bicep muscle that's holding it in place as blood's pouring from the wound right now all right that ends percy's turn keyleth you're up up here are you coming from up here you mean all righty let's take this here balancing here there we go a dc what oh no keyleth's dead laura and all right what's the dc on that strength this is a saving throw okay one of them fails one of them succeeds in a random direction all right let's go ahead and see what direction that's a one so he gets flung this way 20 feet five ten 15 20 (yells impact) falls prone there yes that would be-- 2d6 that puts it at i rolled double sixes on that so that's 12 points of damage yes he is (yells impact) as this whirlwind of-- laura and yeah as you see of the roof itself up there portions of the rooftop are cracking off and spinning into the void of wind that keyleth's currently creating within herself portions of the tree branches are swirling into it as various leaves and dead plant life that had been scattered around the roof are all filling this giant vortex that has appeared on the roof of the margrave's house tearing into both of the archers one of them flung off landing face-first the other one-- takes half damage okay all right five points of bludgeoning damage all right does that finish your turn all right pike you're up okay spiritual weapon as a cleric that's a level two we'll use this metal d20 where do you want to place it we'll say in this central area there what weapon of sarenrae's retribution would you want to summon in spiritual form upon kevdak okay so a large greathand sword almost a light reflection mirror-image of the craven edge that nearly tore the soul from your friend-- you see a large light blade of sarenrae's wrath emerges out of the stonework in the center of the square floats in the air for a second and you want to go ahead and make that and this is your bonus action-- if you want to use your action to cast a spell you can't do higher than a level two right now because of the limitations on spells in our homebrew however do you want to have it attack kevdak all right go ahead and roll for the damage with advantage wait 'til the surprise round's over all right so you're looking at 4d8 well that's only on your melee attack it's not your actual spells so roll 4d8 multiply that by two critical hit you roll 4d8 times two so 22 plus your wisdom modifier so 30 half that to 15 as the blade strikes down onto the now currently brutalized kevdak who is still held in place angrily being whaled upon by the majority of you so what else do you want to do this turn if anything you can move you have an action it lasts for a minute and it's not concentration as a bonus action you can make it move and attack every round so here you could make an acrobatics check what's the total fresh off the 20 pike looks over the edge leaps hits a little bit to the side her feet actually break-- from the weight of the armor and the angle you hit break some of the shingles on the rooftop and you end up slipping onto your shield and you slide off the roof and end up on the ground there all right pike that ends your turn now i get to do some more stuff all right so three of these individuals some of which you may have passed in your time and two of which you see are members that were absorbed into the tribe from what was previously the rivermaw tribe (roar) give off these angry roars and go into an immediate rage breaking the surprise element and charge three of them on you one of them goes darting across the field right towards you pike with that these pull out this sheet here these herd of the storm warmongers are going to go apeshit on your ass grog that's six attacks on you because of the flanking rules that's going to put four of them at advantage first one is going to be an 18 to hit misses the first one goes and swings towards you and you duck underneath it and whoomph misses you by a mile however as that's happening another blade comes the other direction that's going to be a 25 natural 20 third one so one hit second one's going to be a 28 so that's two hits and a critical and then one that doesn't have advantage on you with both strikes is going to be 23 that hits and a 16 that misses so four hits and one crit all righty so the four hits first that's going to be 15 points of slashing damage reduced to seven right ooh 19 points of slashing damage reduced to eight 13 points of slashing damage reduced to six and another 13 reduced to six now for the crit (counting) that's going to be 22 points of slashing damage on that reduced to 11 pike so you're now surrounded on all sides kevdak's there before you but you've now been completely swarmed in by three of these entities pike this one rushes towards you (battle-cry) this female half-elf you can see a line of drool from her face with the sheer speed she was running and the froth that was forming at the corner of it she leaps into the air blade in front and is going to come down on your tiny form (counting) that's 28 to hit on the first one and a 28 rolled 18s on both advantage ones right so two hits on you you take 19 points of slashing damage from the first strike only because he's raging 19 on the first strike the second one is 13 so that's a total of 32 points of slashing damage to you and that's going to end the barbarians' turn everyone else finishes out surprise round now we're back into full initiative everyone's in play top of the round vex you're up if you aimed specifically for something it would be at disadvantage and a minus five to hit i mean he's paralyzed so it would have advantage so it would cancel out it would be just a regular attack at minus five yes it's a technical weapon it's used essentially against structures objects it's an explosive in an arrow that is used primarily to destroy structures yeah i mean it would hurt people like a regular arrow and it might do a little bit extra but-- not that you know of you don't have a full understanding of what the arrow's capable of you did not create it what're you doing hurry vax you're on deck within five feet of him and you're doing it at what level level three so that's 3d10 points of piercing damage all righty okay so go ahead and make an attack against kevdak that is going to be-- yeah with advantage because it's not an aimed shot so go ahead and take it are you serious i've gotten like one i've had two that's true that's true i actually could've been worse all right so go ahead and roll against kevdak that is going to be six or 3d10 times two correct yeah 32 on him reduce that to 16 piercing all righty and then all the rest of them have to make dexterity saving throws against your spell dc what's your spell dc this includes grog all right so half damage to you grog which is halved again one quarter because there's a whole bunch of raging individuals two of them succeed as well and also take eight damage and then one of them takes full damage at 16 all righty so that concludes your action you want to move or you going to stay where you are it's going to be hard-pressed for you this turn to pull out your broom i mean you've been clutching your broom with you this whole time you leaned it up against the wall as you hid down there okay that brings us to the next in the initiative order vax okay shove them all right let's go ahead and do a shove action find myself on this one here-- all right so for shove-- i need you to go ahead and-- --make an athletics check yes all right to 20 that's going to be a 12 laura and so you shove it five feet this way all right so it's going to go ahead and make an acrobatics-- towards me all right this way shove they do make an acrobatics check but they do land off the side here so they take eight points of damage being pushed off the side all righty so that person's now fallen out of sight (yells) off the side yeah the chimney should offer you enough and you have a tree between the two of you anyway make a dexterity make a stealth check okay well sneak attack is if it's an attack with advantage anyway well the shove was your action okay hold on let me see if it's-- you don't have two actions you have two attacks let me check and see if it is there is a distinction there yeah this attack replaces one of them if you have multiple attacks with the attack action which you don't so you have your offhand bonus and the haste one so you do have-- both hit 36 half that to-- i know that brings it to 36 18 no but it's half-damage for him okay four damage gotcha total 22 points of damage on him as he's taking all these hits all right you do have a little bit of movement because you-- all right there we go so you're now hidden up against that roof right below there and your stealth check was 25 earlier so we'll go with that move the board a little bit for the people that are watching so they can get a better view here there we go so you're over here right here liam all right so that brings us to-- no you're done your turn's over yeah all right so this archer here is going to turn looking over at the-- let's see he's currently handled he's okay right there this archer saw you firing over in that hide he's going to turn to you archer's going to take two shots pulling on his longbow (arrow sounds) two arrows at you percy that is a 20 to hit on the first one and a 25 on the second first one is 11 points of piercing damage to you yep all right the second one is going to go ahead and do 13 points of piercing damage okay go ahead and roll for it you catch the arrow in front of your face (laughs) that's amazing okay you can see from the distance the visage of this half-orc looks back as you do that and goes-- and goes to shakily-- hand reaching back for another arrow this archer's going to go ahead and leap down onto here oh you do get an attack of opportunity on him pretty sure that hits also rolled a natural 19 on the acrobatics check so lands fine but you do manage to do one attack worth of damage to him as he jumps down cool so your elemental form swings wide manages to slam the bottom of them as they leap down sending them into a spin but they do manage to catch themself because they're quite acrobatic in doing so they step up to the very edge here to their friend who is currently on the ground who is also going to get up there and they're both going to look at each other pull their arrows out and they're going to go ahead and make a series of strikes let's see this one here is going to go ahead and is going to shoot at pike because pike's on the ground and this one's going to go ahead and strike at grog because it can't see percy over there through the tree so grog-- that is a 19 misses you (arrow sound) one arrow hits the bit of your shoulder armor right here and shatters off the bone the second one however is a 26 all right so from that one you take i don't like that cocked nine points of piercing damage reduced to four the one that's taking two strikes at you pike because you're on the ground now there is one individual attacking you that is on the other side of your body so you're pretty visible from that point in time however the attack because you are prone it has disadvantage on the attack rolls with you because it's not within five feet of you but it's going to go ahead and attempt to make it two 17s in a row plus ten that's-- sorry not plus ten plus eight on the archers yeah plus eight so that's 25 and natural one on the other disadvantage so that misses you take 13 points of piercing damage from one of the arrows (arrow sound) so it's going to do there they finish their turns this one is going to being pushed shoved off come around here is going to come over this way and hide to the side just going to watch what's happening that finishes the archers' turn kevdak (grunts) unable to do anything is going to attempt to make a saving throw and that is going to be a total of 18 what's your dc oh man all right well that ends kevdak's turn scanlan you're up what're you doing now so moving up to here yeah you can do that yeah if you get it there you can manage to hit all of them but grog right there one two three four five six all right so go ahead and roll that kevdak automatically fails because he's paralyzed so does greenbeard all right so 34 reduced to half because he's raging that brings it to six no 17 all right and then greenbeard takes 34 the other ones there they do not get advantages because they're all just fighters that's a failure failure what was the spell dc on the wand because it's different from yours okay so that's a success success so two of them over there take-- all right all righty great so (explosion) giant burst of flame hits it actually sets fire to this entire structure the wooden barricade is in flames we'll say for the purposes of considering that all right so there we go there is currently-- so those are on fire all right so down there all right make an acrobatics check 19 you leap down and make it right there healing word okay what's the range on it he's just out of your range you can do that you can shout over the side you have to get into view of her which means you have to move a little bit closer to the edge but yeah okay so you get about there glance off the side all right go for it all right so go ahead and roll your heal for pike grog you're up next hey it all helps all right and with that grog you're up you can go for it your regular straight attack you have advantage and then it's disadvantage for that so that brings it to a regular attack minus five because of the called shot 23 hits with the minus five still hits (cheering) so it's a d12 because he's paralyzed and five feet away this is with your axe right so with the axe it's a d12 plus your raging bonus plus your strength well the rage bonus should be plus-- the total becomes plus-- three plus-- four isn't it right now so it should be seven yeah you're not using your warhammer you're not attuned to this weapon so what'd you roll on the dice 11 technically it's a critical hit so i mean it's a critical hit so you do your brutal critical you roll two more d12s so it was an 11 times two that's 22 plus seven that's 29 plus 2d12 34 43 reduced to half that's 21 points of slashing damage with that thunk the blade finds its way into his side as you hear cracking on the rock below him the sound of the left gauntlet (cracking) hitting the bottom of the square the fingers twitch in the gauntlet as he's currently standing there with his left arm bisected from the rest of his body no okay straight into his back 22 hits 28 half that is 14 so you're hacking into him you see the wounds are opened and his body is shaking from the amount of pain that's wracking him at this time he's still holding up against a lot of damage that's come to him but he's starting to look a little rough you can yeah that will heal you a superior let's see superior is 8d4 plus eight your superior that's the expensive one you guys got all right so you heal 20 all right that ends your turn grog all righty unless you want to move i mean you have you wouldn't be able to wield your axe next turn if you want to try it they're all going to get an attack on you all right all right so that finishes your turn grog next up is greenbeard who is currently frozen in place however rolls an 18 plus five as far as his wisdom is plus ten so that puts him at 28 so he resists the hold person and is currently no longer affected by that all right that finishes his turn though because that's the end of his turn percy you're up probably a little bit of column a a little bit of column b what was it 28 hits non-sharpshooter okay 14 points of piercing damage and he gets shoved off the back of the roof he's going to make an acrobatics check which he succeeds so he lands down there and he only takes one point of damage from the fall but there you go fungal moss on his whole neck and chest area all right okay all right so that's going to end your turn keyleth you're up right here 13 strength saves on both of them archers-- all right that's a natural 19 plus two and two natural 19s in a row yeah they both make their saves 19 halved all right so that puts them at nine points of bludgeoning damage each not really having much of an effect at this point in the fight however as you swirl around picking up the debris from the roof as you can it slams into them and they brace against it but they still glancing over their shoulder realize that they've got to continue what they're doing now the bigger threat appears to be out in front of them right right so you're up in there up in their shit there you go no all righty finished your turn all right pike you're up they're on you right so you're getting up that's half your movement to stand up all right this way what're you doing ashley what're you doing so your sprinter's boots activate which gives you double movement right so you can move 50 feet but you moved up it took you 25 to stand up because it's half your speed to get up from prone so you still have 25 feet you can move this side all right so you move here right okay so you rush over there that one guy takes a swing at you as you rush by gah or girl i should say the female half-elf swings with the giant blade that's going to be a 23 okay as the blade smacks you from behind as you rush past you suffer 14 points of slashing damage in your back but you keep running around the edge all right what are you doing all righty what you got ashley what you got what you doing and you're done you're healed up okay that's the end of your turn you have a bonus action still if you want okay so go ahead and swing for the attack on that one well i mean yeah you have advantage you have advantage on the attack by the way he's paralyzed he's still paralyzed add your spell attack it's okay you've been away for a while 22 that hits so go ahead and roll your 3d8 i think it is no 4d8 plus your wisdom modifier which is plus-- what's your wisdom modifier yeah no it's not attack it's your wisdom modifier but what's the dice the dice are doubled because it's a critical hit 36 half that to 18 then add your wisdom modifier plus four all right so half of that would be two so 20 20 points of damage to him from the strike of that all righty that finishes your turn kind of right now yeah first the woman who just swung past you is going to go ahead and rush around the corner as well and follow you since you got out of the way rush into and go after you pike the three that are on you grog are still going to after watching you cut one of kevdak's arms off roar angrily around you all three of them (roar) and go into another round of angry angry strikes against you all right so that comes to you grog since you did reckless attack on him for the stuff they all have advantage on you anyway so all the attacks are with advantage that's six attacks that's a natural 20 (yelling) 24 on the fourth 26 on the fifth no they all five hits and one crit they all hit yeah reckless attack puts you in a bad position when you're surrounded with guys that can do multiple hits that are also barbarians we'll do the crit first on you you already used the stone's resistance oh the barbarian yeah so that'll help seven plus eight 15 reduced to half that's seven so i'll give you the direct amounts here so this is with the reduction so that's seven points of slashing damage another seven another seven here we go that's a nine not that great that's a six and then now the crit and then i thought differently but i didn't say it out loud but because you're calling me on it i'll let it happen okay that was double sixes so that's 22 plus eight is 30 so 15 points of slashing damage on all those strikes against you pike two attacks on you that's a natural 20 and that's 15 no so that is a one and two so that's three six plus eight you take 14 points of slashing damage from this barbarian female who's all up on your grill ending that turn it's now the druid's turn over here end of surprise round the druid's going to rush forward here and do a 5th-level cure wounds on kevdak all right we're looking at 5d8 yeah it's too high or no okay so it's at a fifth level go ahead and roll for it adding so it's d20 plus five plus two because of your bardic knowledge roll a d20 add seven let me check here real fast plus the spell's level yeah it's dispelled yeah counterspell (cheering) okay (laughs) all right that ends his turn now so this guy here let's see got to stand up for this one pardon me we'll say for the sake of this going to put him up there this guy jumps up this way too bad these two guys rush forward and grab these innocents here yeah into the middle here towards the fire pushing them towards the fire with what remains of their movement let's see this guy's going to move in towards grog there this archer's going to get back up-- well actually no archers aren't part of this movement this guy here's going to move into grog there i don't know what to tell you man these guys here seeing hah this guy's going to be up with this one here this guy can't really get over there so he's going to go ahead and rush forward because they're-- yeah you guys can do it they can do it too and they're pretty strong so he basically runs up puts the sword on his back jumps up onto the roof pulls the weapon he doesn't manage to get an attack on you because it took all of his movement to get up there but he gets up there right now you're not a huge threat to them at the moment and they're both going to focus actually on you scanlan when it gets around to their turn though this guy's going to go ahead and pull both of these innocent folk in front of them as a shield this guy's going to get freaked out rush around the building and try to escape there okay so bringing us into the combat portion of the round grog you have two more attacking you this is the bladestorms with advantage that's going to be a 14 18 so first one both attacks swinging across you you're feeling it on your back but it's catching most of your armor and part of your flesh that is nice and calloused and does not really do any damage the second one rolls a 20 second one and second attack on the second one is a 21 yeah okay so you get a critical and hit on this one so this is the bladestorm critical is going to be 16 eight points of slashing damage on that one and the next one's going to be four points of slashing damage this is already halved just so you know so that's that round there against pike only one of them could get to you and still attack this round so pike that's 19 and that's going to be a 15 so one strikes against you hits the back of the armor and streaks off so you spin around as the second blade comes around and you deflect it with the shield angrily that brings us back to the top of the initiative order vex you're up oh there was the one guy that got up there with movement thank you for the reminder so before that happens actually reminder this one did have enough movement to get up there and still get attacks off on you that's going to be a 13 with the first strike misses second one's going to be a 22 all right that's going to be 17 points of slashing damage from that greatsword whoosh i need you to go ahead and make a concentration check yeah you have warcaster so you have advantage on that it's a constitution so 17 going to check it real fast concentration here-- plus ten half the damage you take so that would be ten yeah you maintain concentration all right vex you're up where do you want to go you're going to scoot by here okay it's a good thing kevdak is paralyzed because otherwise he'd get an attack on you this will put you in range for their strikes so you're going to have to stay in place or move past and suffer five attacks of opportunity but for you to get low enough to hand him that they all have big double greatswords and they're-- well half of them are half-giants so you can do this as you swish up which you've already said you're going to do you fly up and you reach down with the locket and you hand over to him do you-- okay so you just hold it there oh i misunderstood what you were trying to do all right so what-- what's it say again yeah so grog are you willing and with that as you reach down and touch grog with it you see grog's form shimmer for a second into dark shadow and then vanish inside-- okay so grog is currently off the table as he's locked inside the gauntlet where are you going as you rush away you do get-- back here you mean okay we'll say for the purposes of this you are back here as you fly off from doing this all of them swing wide at you that's five attacks of opportunity against you that's 20 that is 17 well it's aid you have 15 extra hit points so that's what it is yeah aid just gives you guys extra hit points so anyway 17 doesn't hit all right so three more attacks that was cocked 19 all right 26 and that's 19 again so four attacks hit you first one is for 14 points of slashing damage next one hoo that's eight 12 points of slashing damage nine plus four-- another 13 points of slashing damage and the last one that's going to be 15 points of slashing damage you streak off as all these blades hammer into your side cutting the bottom of your feet one of them hits you in the back of the neck and curves across your lower back and as you pull away clutching it you look at your hand with the blood pooling in the middle of your palm and you look at the gem with a faint glimmer of a form of a human inside the gem that's currently mingling with all the blood that's smeared across your body as all of a sudden you coast around through the air the wind whirling past you and you spin around towards the top of the margrave's estate and you can hear the blood in your body-- (heartbeat sounds)-- in your ears as you start getting a little dizzy and realizing just how rough you are at the moment from that exchange technically you'd probably be higher than this up there if you wanted to fly around okay so that ends your turn vax you're up yes oh you mean dodge off-- towards the tree drop off here you do okay (laughter) 22 as you dart past this blur of dark motion swings towards you and where it is about to catch some of the armor there's a burst of black feathers that lift behind where the blade struck through as you dart up right into the face of kevdak who's like (strained sound) trying desperately to resist the effect of this go for it advantage on the attacks well 32 plus six because he takes half-damage right 72 halved puts you at 36 all right so yeah so as you rush up you slam your dagger square into the side of his body and as you push it inside you can see his eyes glancing back down towards you held in place his arm broken still dangling from the little elements of ligaments that keep it shifting there with the impact of the slam it swings from the sheer force of the blow as you push the blade to the hilt and even further in you feel your hands actually push into the wound itself about an inch your fingers getting dark and wet with the crimson gore of the interior of his body as you push up inside you pull back pulling the blade around in your pommel and jam it over the top of the shoulder into the side of his body the muscle flexes from the tension of the hold person spell managing to reduce a portion of the damage but it left a pretty serious wound okay he does not get an attack of opportunity on you because he is paralyzed and the guy already took one against you so he already used his reaction you rush past him you do not have enough movement to get to the top but you do get to the corner right where the barrel is okay that ends your turn it's now the archers' turn this guy here is going to go ahead he's out of range of you marisha shoving this barrel off the side to try and get away from you marisha you do get an attack of opportunity it does fall and hit the barrel next to you i mean next to vax it doesn't hit you but it spooks you momentarily as it slams onto the barrel next to your side and rolls off what'd you get keyleth ten total misses what'd you roll 16 versus the archer 17 just misses they're both having now made out the connection between the mooning and kevdak holding himself in place they're both trying to take you out one of them has disadvantage because you're in its spot and it couldn't get away from you it had nowhere to go really so one's taking two attacks at you scanlan that is going to be heh a 12 and a 26 the other one's going to have two attacks with disadvantage against you that's even with disadvantage that's a 21 and the other one with disadvantage is a 15 yeah it's true so three attacks hit you the first one is going to be all right that's a full ten plus-- 14 points of piercing damage go ahead and roll your concentration so roll and add two because it's plus your constitution 19 okay the next attack deals five points go ahead and roll again with advantage damn all right and the third one yeah what's your constitution saving throw it's plus two right last one does 11 points of piercing damage to you and make another series of checks for concentration fine that warcaster feat man okay that finishes those two guys this one here's off to the side this one's going to go ahead and turn around this way and get around the edge actually he's going to-- this one over here didn't notice you swing by over the top swoosh overhead it does see percy on the roof that shot it you do have partial cover so we'll say that's half cover so plus two to your ac against this guy's two arrow shots against you all righty that is 26 to hit all right second strike same thing 26 18 and 18 so that's nine points of piercing damage with the first shot and 14 points of piercing damage with the second one what are you contesting it with how many times can you use that yeah so go ahead and make the attempt 14 points yeah so go ahead and mark that okay and this guy over here at the very top moves over as well and is going to go ahead and take two more shots at scanlan since there's currently not a whole lot he can see in the area that's a threat to him near this gleaming beacon of pink and purple up on the rooftop another friend of his is currently whaling on so two attacks against you that's going to be a 19 and 23 all right you take another six points of piercing damage go ahead and make your-- what was it 20 okay second one is 14 points of piercing damage and with that the hold person fades concentration lost from the barrage of arrows from the nearby herd archers you hear a roar across the battlefield (roars) currently with one busted arm no arm on the other side kevdak is screaming in terrible pain and anger all right archers finish their turn it comes to kevdak's turn he's going to go ahead and use his bonus action to go ahead and use second wind heals 17 hit points on that rolled a ten he is then going to-- let's see huh yeah he has no axe he reaches over and picks up your hammer oh yeah no actually no he can't do that right now yeah he turns to one of his subordinates to the side and says one of you pick that up the rest of you kill them and looks over to the other two innocent that are on the ground right now he then is going to go ahead and start moving over towards greenbeard yes a spiritual weapon is technically not a creature it doesn't get a reaction it's only on a bonus action you get a chance to attack with it yeah he's going to move over here around the flames up to greenbeard okay that finishes his turn there's not much else he can do at this point scanlan you're up what're you doing scanlan how many-- okay where in the center here at kevdak that would hit that archer it would hit those innocents there both of those innocents yeah with your angle you could angle it this way yeah it would yep so scanlan fires the fireball at kevdak it detonates kevdak save for that yeah he makes his save because it's dc 15 greenbeard also makes his save 42 damn (counting) ten so kevdak takes ten points of fire damage because he made his save for half damage and then he takes half that from his rage greenbeard takes 21 he's looking rough greenbeard is now burned and (grunts) is looking a bit frenzied at this point the archer does make the save high dex they take 21 points on him this archer there also makes it however that one's taken-- no that one hasn't taken a lot of damage it was that one over there this one here does also make his save that guy there does make his save they're all rolling 15 or above on this this guy here rolls a natural 20 on his save well that was the innocent there it's still 21 points of damage for a peasant he is incinerated and you hear the horrible scream of pain as-- first thing you killed in this fight was an innocent villager and with that scream that echoes in the back of your mind knowing the decision you made a little part of your heart sinks in your chest however keyleth i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity save as well all right so you take 21 points of fire damage and actually that guy technically would be-- yeah that innocent there would also be in range he doesn't make his save he is also incinerated both of them burn all right so as a healing word spell a creature you can see within range so no you have to be able to see her to aid her which you could do if you wanted to risk it so yeah you get over this side here all right so you move around him and you see pike now surrounded by a number of the barbarians you can use your bonus action to heal her if you'd like how do you inspire her (singing) take your d10 ends scanlan's turn that's the end of your turn grog you are sealed you have no turn brings us to greenbeard who's in a rough place right now greenbeard is going to go ahead and finally do something kevdak protect the herd and he reaches forward and touches him as he's right there that's heal okay so that's a 6th-level go ahead and roll add seven and you have to get 16 or higher what level are you casting counterspell at no heal 70 old version was almost all your hit points at fifth level all right so you're casting it at fifth level counterspell mark that off less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you use so it is fifth level doesn't do anything because what fifth level does is it increases the equal level of the spell to cancel fifth level it's a 6th-level spell so now you just roll so now roll add seven you're trying to get 16 or higher no with that greenbeard reaches out and touches kevdak kevdak roars in pain as all of a sudden the muscles and tendons in his arm reform and in his still-wounded but now-functional arm he crushes the gauntlet in his hand bring me the other and you see the other one who was over there reach for the gauntlet greenbeard is now going to go ahead and back behind here trying to get behind the tree as he now notices he's in the open done his business in that moment no as a bonus action he's going to go ahead and turn into an earth elemental all right now percy you're up kevdak was on the cusp he does yeah he continues to rage if he's taken damage since the last round he's taken a lot of damage it's over here right now it's on the ground all right go ahead and make an acrobatics check oh right this is a jump so this would be athletics i'll say you can make an acrobatics with disadvantage or an athletics with a single roll since this is actually the strength of the run it's not a big distance so it's not a huge dc for a jump but it's your call what do you want to do all right go for it what'd you roll you rolled a one so as you leap off the side your foot hits the edge of the tile and the blade behind you swings which i believe is going to hit you with a 20 is that your ac 18 yeah you take seven plus four 11 points of slashing damage the blow however is just enough to throw you off-kilter and you go plummeting down into the alleyway falling prone you can use your movement to get back up the remainder of your movement but you can't move from there the fall does deal an additional five points of bludgeoning damage all right so you get back up-- you're now in this alleyway right here facing this line here is all you can really see from your perspective you can see vax you can see kevdak and you can see this dude here and an archer but has partial cover because of the-- okay second wind second wind man a headshot with the big gun right so you're using the trickshot on him that hits all right 26 points of piercing damage reduced to half 13 constitution yeah that's a 23 he's got a high constitution saving throws it's kind of his thing same thing sharpshooter any other trickshots you're going to use or deadshot anything you want to use i could switch it up if you want okay for deadeye shot go for it with the minus five yeah great yeah so go ahead and roll damage on that 36 halved to 18 that's your three attacks shot reloaded shot okay angry percy's angry as part of the function it's like-- you can use your action as a dash so you could all right so your fourth attack is a reload fifth is an attack go for it is this deadeye as well or just regular okay sharpshooter go for the shot 23 hits hah you rolled a 20-sider instead of a 12 16 points of piercing damage all right and a reload that's your turn percy is done dealing a grand total of 47 points of damage in that round (cheering) okay ryan i need the mini-box that was not brought dammit sam all right for the time being i'll use this one here all right so keyleth you revert back we'll use this barmaid for the time being all right so keyleth what are you doing you dropped form oh shit all right what are you firestorming where what are you doing ten ten-foot cubes so how do you want to arrange this here you can do there which would burst off the corner it would hit kevdak the archer and greenbeard all right the tree is spared okay so we have there there you'd be able to get one that wouldn't actually hit any of them six seven and that's about all you can get eight nine ten it wouldn't be able to get that far over i mean you could-- (counting) you could probably get this section there yeah because they're all pretty clustered just barely go ahead and roll damage on that keyleth i'd say you'd be able to get this guy this guy you wouldn't be able to but all the rest of these you could as long as you get over there 7d10 dexterity saving throws correct against your spell dc 29 total points of fire damage hm okay kevdak takes-- he failed his save but he takes half that so 14 points of fire damage yep greenbeard takes the full 29 yeah greenbeard's taking earth elemental damage now that archer that archer burns up archer screams in pain as it incinerates from the firestorm that bladestorm there takes 29 damage that guy there they all take 29 damage that druid fails 29 damage there that druid and the rest of them fail success fail with a one fail fail with another one okay so 29 all righty all right cool all righty so that finishes your turn with a firestorm too high-level you can't do it grasping vine's a 4th-level spell you can only do up to a second level as a bonus you can't see pike right now pike is out of the room currently roll a perception check nope you do not see vex you have no idea where she is right now you just saw her scanlan you can see over there but even then he's too far away for a healing word i think pike you're up correct there are three ah there are five there total actually that's good to know there's four of them there no it's fine there we go that'll work well technically it doesn't work that way all right all right so what's the dc on that matt and that's a failure that's a failure that's a 20 so that succeeds that's a failure so one of them succeeded three of them didn't so does that end your turn your bonus action still what are you going to do you do still have spiritual weapon up if you want to use your bonus action to do that the spiritual weapon can only move 20 feet it can only move 20 feet as a bonus action but you can't see him right now you'd have to move over to have him in view one of them would if you were to try and dodge past yeah what do you want to do it's up to you what do you want to do go ahead and make an acrobatics check as you try to tumble in your armor between the legs of one of the guys in front of you whatever your acrobatics is what is it 14 let me double-check here real fast let me deal with it guys you don't want to prod me right now let's see the roll there all right so you manage to barely push past but you do trigger a second attack of opportunity to do so from that guy that big half-orc there that gets in your way so that's two strikes against you that is a natural 20 and that's going to be a 13 so that is a pretty low roll ten points of slashing damage what are you at what're you at so as you dodge past get slammed by two blades you arc around the corner and they're all looking at each other confused some of them affected by this magic they aren't expecting and you rush around and you see in the distance kevdak who's now getting shot a couple times gets set on fire flames burst up and he starts screaming out in pain as you turn the corner you look over at your spiritual weapon and you can nudge it forward right there its full movement 20 feet go ahead and make an attack with your spell attack modifier does not have advantage because he is no longer paralyzed 20 hits go ahead and roll damage so 4d8 plus four still halved but plus four 24 halved to 12 yeah i know so the blade drifts over and in a giant arc swings down with a resounding shining metallic slam the blade streaks through and cuts this swath the blade doesn't stop it passes through and leaves this scar across his body of burned radiant energy (grunt of pain) looks over and glares at you from across the open cobblestone of this marketplace and you see for a second that look that grog saw that caused him to drop his weapon you suddenly feel this quake in your soul this is a powerful entity whose hatred is now bent on you you can if you'd like to you may take more attacks of opportunity though in order for her to move further you might move out of combat with the other guys that are there the command move means on their next turn they attack each other doesn't mean that they're charmed or dominated that would've been ten feet you can move 15 more yeah but you will take two attacks of opportunity if you move out of range of these two you can move 25 total because of your tiny feet you moved ten you have 15 more feet you can move okay barbarians are going now this one picks up the gauntlet and is going to rush over and bring it to kevdak and he's going to go ahead and hold it there as kevdak takes his arm and-- the arm is still in it yeah and he looks at it and takes it with his free hand and clutches it to his chest and looks around at the other ones says we're going and he-- yes he has no weapons his weapon was pulled away from him oh brought the hammer he brings up the hammer as well but he doesn't-- no he has no weapon on him currently he tried to reach for it but he had no functioning arm at the time he told someone to pick it up so someone has your flaming warhammer these guys here are going to move over here move over here and that one's going to be attacking pike over here that's two attacks on pike that's going to be a 13 and a 14 rolled really low on that one you hear the growl behind you and without even turning your head you slam your shield up and deflect one of the blows look over your shoulder and glare at it as another one comes down and this-- you take your mace and swing it in a wide arc over and slam their blade against the stone wall of the side deflecting the entire attack as that's happening both of those guys go forward two and a one goes up against one of the peasants and strikes and the peasant ducks out of the way and manages to avoid the attacks this guy here with the giant club goes down and dodges one of the attacks the other one does come down at 11 yeah this peasant gets smashed no this was the drunker guy all right that ends their turn it's the druids' turn now this druid here is going to move forward seeing you over there vax reaches out towards you as it only has its 4th-level spells and lower left because of you you counterspell motherfucker it's going to go ahead and cast blight on you liam i'm going to need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw as the druid reaches out at you with its hand and says kevdak inside and concentrates gripping out this female goliath you can see with these thick braids in the back of her head pulled into a very very tight braid down to the lower part of her back reaches out and grasps you feel the blood begin to pool in parts of your body and your veins turn dark around yes total all right you take 41 points of necrotic damage as you feel the energy pulse through your entire body and it's like all the blood in your body momentarily becomes toxic your vision blurs and you feel the dizziness hit you and you almost stumble to one knee but you catch yourself against the wall that ends the druids' turn now the blademongers are going to go all right these guys are all going to attack each other except for that one well one of them's going to go ahead and attack pike because it was the one that wasn't affected by the command spell that's going to be a 19 no okay and a 13 no cannot hit this armored little gnome who's pushed against the wall and you're deflecting blows and taking hits against the armor that are denting the front of it and you're grinning and bearing it these guys are attacking each other now that is seven-- it hits they can't hit you but they can hit each other two attacks against that guy and then the other guy both hit so the first guy takes 14 24 points of damage ends up-- that guy there then also takes 22 points of damage on them okay they start hacking into each other with their blades suddenly trying to figure out what's happening and technically another barbarian strikes so the third one who actually missed you that would've been an attack against its own guy because that was the one that didn't hit so he would've been-- once again against this guy so he deals an additional 13 points of damage against one of the other ones okay got you so that finishes their turn there so these guys here are going to move around the fire this guy's going to move up here yeah this guy here is going to go ahead and move one two three and then using greenbeard who reaches out and grabs him with his elemental arm and alley-oops him up onto the roof with the acrobatics roll rolls a one this guy gets slammed into the side and falls back to the ground missing his turn yeah (laughs) greenbeard miscalculates and actually slams him against the wall and then the goliath sort of slides down takes four points of bludgeoning damage from that (laughter) a three and 14 no he's going to hit the kid kid gets cleaved they're now trying to find a way to draw you out they're taking turns doing this keeping as each person they strike down they look about the rooftops again for more of you that's going to go ahead and these guys here are going to go ahead and start swarming over towards the front this guy here (counting) can't quite get to you vax this guy here seeing percy jump down is going to go ahead and jump down to meet you from behind see if he makes his he fails on a two he falls prone takes-- he takes 12 points of falling damage however he does use the rest of his movement to stand back up and is going to take two swings at you percy that's going to be a 23 to hit correct okay second one's a natural 20 so the first strike hits you for 12 points of slashing damage second strike double ones on the crit so that's four eight points of slashing damage with the second hit (laughs) i rolled double ones on his crit that's really frustrating you're fine with that all right that ends their turn top of the round vex you're up as you're standing there now bleeding profusely holding the necklace that holds grog what are you doing yeah that's 50 all right all right i'll say essentially because you held your action last turn if you wanted to go ahead and take your action to do a drop attack on this point here yeah i'd say it's your bonus action to do it yeah so grog you were released falling down to land on top of kevdak with the bloodaxe in a downward arc go ahead and roll an attack yeah up to you ones and twenties man you got to stop this and that's why he did reckless (screaming and cheering) with the brutal critical at this level how many extra dice is it for you but then that's gone up since you leveled previously so you are now at i believe-- so brutal critical yeah 13 increases to two so you roll an additional 2d12 on the attack so roll 1d12 plus you're not raging anymore because you spent the last round all right so plus three ten plus two more d12s you only double the first roll 42 brings it to 21 damage how do you want to do this (screaming and cheering) as the shadow fires from the necklace as she holds it aloft bleeding and shaking you appear and dive down in silence the square coming towards you as kevdak clutching in the one nearly ruined arm the other arm that you bisected is turning the corner about to open the door to dive into the house to avoid it looks up just in time to see you streaking down what do you do with the sheer force of the blow the weight behind it and the intent the axe hits him right in the side of the neck cleaves off part of his ear shaves off part of his skin here exposing the jawbone hits here breaks the clavicle tears through and every single rib is destroyed it cuts right through the center of this giant body until it gets to about the midsection where it catches finally the upper torso splits open and covers you with gore however you still impact not raging you take-- 25 points of fall damage from the impact and 21 points under you have that barbarian ability-- would that be part of this if you drop to zero hit points while raging you're not raging so yeah as you shout the blow in a very superman-versus-doomsday way cleaves him in half and as you slam into the ground you pull the axe free as your shattered legbones give under and you fall to the ground you smile as you see his form crumple and then you (impact) face-first into the ground before him it's still your turn you watch as every single herd member in the entire open square gasps at this whole sight they all turn hearing you scream for strongjaw and see this happen as kevdak's body slumps to the ground it shrinks back down to its average size and you crumple to the ground smiling and fall next to him and everyone takes a moment of breathless silence what are you doing vex okay what's the speed of the broom it should say on the broom how fast you can move on it here we go i'll find it for you just a moment guys broom of flying speed of 50 feet so you moved from over here which would have put you-- it's about 50 to get there so you could use your action to dash with it you'd land that's all you could do yeah it's an action to feed a potion to anyone what are you going to do vex hurry up okay okay if you want to make an intimidation check don't hit the table i was going to go inspect it no i trust you guys i trust you guys this is going to be an interesting night to explain to the internet guys all right okay so at this point in time you watch as greenbeard's form shrinks down and shifts back into his goliath form still busted he's looking down at the destroyed crumpled body of kevdak and you there on the ground as well looking up at you above and hovering he looks over at the other goliaths nearby here that are rushing in and they all step out and backwards inspecting this body there's a pause a moment of pause but they've all paid attention to what you said that ends your turn it is now the archers' turn i'm sorry you're up next so you move around okay so you run past there okay so you'd be leaping technically onto the body of kevdak is what you'd be doing so you land onto kevdak's form very angry slash i'll say for the purposes of this you're there because kevdak's body is way too big right now to put on the field all right you land with your hasted movement make an acrobatics check for the jump yeah you scale up run leap land there feet sinking into the body okay it's the archers' turn this archer has its arrow trained on you and is going to hold its action this archer here is going to move up to see what's happened dashing to look out and see what happened doesn't get its turn this archer here who's now moved moves over to this side with its arrow trained on you as well it's also going to hold its action and they're all looking at each other at this mexican standoff moment where they're all poised and ready everyone's holding their actions right now it would be kevdak's turn scanlan you're up okay so you run down okay the guy who was up against you has looked over and is not paying attention at this moment make a stealth check 13 as you rush down the thing he looks over looks at you and goes hey hey and can't even catch you you're too fast make an acrobatics check as you leap off the roof 19 you gnomish three-point-land in this square you're right next to pike now you've landed next to her as you're around the corner now you see scanlan (impact) right next to you you've got about 15 more feet you can move if you wanted to no not at the moment i mean i could say if you wanted to you could move half your movement and take her with you okay you take her hand you and pike move there holding each other's hand okay go ahead and roll the heal on that i also want you to go ahead and make a persuasion check yeah so you go to zero and then eight yes okay good to know finishes your turn scanlan-- yes you do i will say for the purposes of this because i want to do this this is ridiculous i will say grog is now currently being held aloft right there as the hand is clutching grog strongjaw lifting him up into the air you're conscious now as the hand's holding you on its back and you get up from one knee grog it's your turn clatters to the ground at the feet of one of the nearby bladestorms it stops at his foot he looks at it picks it up they all look at each other and greenbeard hobbles out still wounded and hurt into the center of this area greenbeard's his name steps out into the middle looking up at you strongjaw you stand above us all in a way (laughter) make a persuasion check with advantage with advantage on that i don't think it works for abilities (laughs) bing strongjaw it's a little late for that it's okay at this point greenbeard sizes you up from a distance everyone else is waiting for a word you can see everyone is hand on the side of their weapons looking at each other and there's this extremely tense air greenbeard turns around and looks to two of the individuals near the front of the building and goes bring out zanror and the two of them go inside the door and close it behind them they step inside the building and there's this long silence you wait for 30 seconds you can yes are you going to step up you can see him yeah you're going to cast heal as you begin to go for your holy symbol you can see two of the warriors behind you twitch for their weapons the door slams open from the front of the margrave's home you see as the two individuals come out with chains over their shoulders as they drag out into the center two individuals you see another half-giant goliath man one that you've all seen once before on your way to kraghammer months and months ago well yeah about you see him swollen in the face bruised and in shackles dragged out and thrown to the ground and the other one holds over his shoulder another chain he pulls out behind him a half-giant woman with the hair on the sides of her head shaved one single long mane of hair and it looks like she's with child also in shackles and she's pushed to the ground with zanror zanror looks up and you can see him closing his eyes like the daylight itself is very bright and he probably hasn't seen light in a period of time strongjaw well this is a surprise it's at this moment that he looks over and glances and can see the body of kevdak on the ground for the first time and then he goes you did this so as you're brought down to the ground bigby's hand sets you gently on the cobblestone (sighs) i fear the herd's lost its edge priorities my father had grown docile in this place but he wouldn't be if whispers hadn't found his ears and he looks over at greenbeard greenbeard immediately steps back and goes look at him in shackles this isn't a warrior this is a slave both of 'em spits in their direction the one that's holding the chains on zanror pulls them a little tighter and zanror's lifted up a little bit off of his leaning-forward position he's now on his knees and his arms are pulled up in towards his torso and greenbeard looks back towards you this skyshield here spoke against his father he was attempting some sort of a mutiny but we quelled that right quick gave him time to think about it his father was deciding what to do with this traitor and his next of kin you however seemingly stopped his trial so i think it's only fitting that you do the honors of finishing the job and you can see as you were lifted off the ground and everything you did not have your weapon with you as you were on the ground lifted up greenbeard steps over and takes the bloodaxe from the ground walks up to you and hands it out and looks over to zanror let it be and two of the other individuals one of the half-orc individuals looks over hushed and starts backing away from this this is too much for him there's now this tribal tension this cultural tension that only exists within the initial herd and has been only recently adopted by the rivermaw that were absorbed by the herd and are still confused by this two of the goliaths step over and pull and pry out the somewhat soggy leftover arm of kevdak they toss it to the ground before you kevdak at this point is still being held up by the chains and says-- sorry zanror thank you it was unbefitting of us all to be living under one of those beasts under my rule we were going to take back our power as a people oh shit roll an attack if you want to roll damage watch as next week critical role implements dice cam (laughter) all right two more yeah how do you want to do this (laughs) he had taken a shit-ton of damage in the battle and was already moving by-- he had like 12 more hit points left so and with that moment (swishing) with a very slick snapping sound the blade coasts through and the neck retreats as the head continues forward and tumbles to the feet as greenbeard's body takes an instinctual step backward and then falls lifeless in the center of the marketplace all the rest of the herd moves for a second nervously as bigby's hand points to zanror the two that are holding the chains move up and begin to unchain them both taking the shackles off his hands and the female goliath at his side eventually he stands up reaches over and puts his arm around her and says i am sorry worra worra she stands and goes do not be sorry it seems we've been delivered from our judgment she looks up towards you you don't recognize her she's not from the original herd you saved us narrowly being executed grog and he stands up and gets to the front of all the rest of the herd there call forth the rest of our people we do not leave this town yet we claim westruun home for one more night for it is tomorrow at dawn we slam our blades against the hide of a dragon will you join us in this glory and pride fair cousin grog you have proven yourself worthy of life and respect and the might of the herd of storms he looks about and takes in the mental math of all the people that were killed i know you took a few down we'd stand between the people that were loyal to me and my father a good 43 men strong he steps forward to you now there's a slight limp to his walk but there's too much pride for him to show it as he tenses and reaches out his hands to you and clasps it in his own beastmaster-style holding onto it for the dragons it shall be he releases the grasp let them walk amongst us as brethren come we have much preparation to do and he goes back to worra and limps into her arms and she takes him up and it's her strength now lifting him on his feet and the two begin to make their way across the rest of the center of town all the rest of them take their weapons and they relax and they still keep a very wary eye of you the words have been said and there is still this tenuous truce but they're still coming off the cusp of adrenaline warfare and the slaughtering of their previous leader however they are going along with the words that were spoken and there is a look of general fear and respect in their eyes guarded as it may be what do you guys want to do the gauntlets have been retrieved and given to grog yeah you're going to land all right trinket who's been hiding in the back room there they did happen yeah he's done do you no it just raises him from the dead okay this will take a while all right so as the rest of herd move on following zanror they begin to separate to gather the rest of the herd throughout the town a few stay behind keeping watch-- okay it's going to cost-- 500 gold are consumed by the casting of this spell as part of the-- okay takes an hour so as you guys take this time this is a short rest for those of you who aren't part of this ritual you complete the ritual go ahead and make a religion check she was like i'm done i'm out peace d20 add your religion okay vex you said you wanted to help what did you want to help with the ritual on right sorry helping with the money how are you aiding with the ritual yes well she was casting-- she was preparing the ritual preparing seals and taking out the components and praying to sarenrae and speaking the rites which channel through her in celestial language although she doesn't understand celestial she speaks it through as part of the spell almost like-- yep how are you aiding in this sure go ahead and make a straight wisdom roll okay how would you like to assist roll a performance check all right as you finish the ritual both the voices of pike and percy begin to harmonize across these various refrains in a language that especially when spoken in this rhythmic ritualistic way it seems to almost create a third voice and then you hear clearly there is a third voice harmonizing with them that you don't know where it's coming from as the beautiful musical tones of the singing come to a close your holy symbol the glow fades and a moment passes before you hear the soft coughing of the child's throaty expulsion himself taking in his next breath of air he sits up cradling his head what happened it's okay (laughter) okay okay he's like (choking sounds) all right so the child is brought back to life healed confused dazed but not really understanding the circumstances around him just happy to-- yeah he's good to go his wounds close the dried blood's still there but he seems to be in perfect health at the moment although a little weak and worse for wear i don't know no everything went by so fast they tried to pull them out but they found me and pulled me out and brought me here that's all there was a fight and a lot of yelling that's all i remember up by the temples he smiles a little bit you can still see the dried blood streaks across his face but you can see past that to the smile that peeks through beneath his dirty face okay he laughs and trinket licks him and takes some of that off and he is excited to be grasping something although he slides a couple times you can see he's weak from the remnants of the resurrection spell okay anybody else doing anything for the short rest i mean there is the bloodaxe there is the-- the gauntlets and he has four plus-one enchanted javelins that he did not have an opportunity to use this battle so mark that mark down in your refrigerated bag flayed bear tattoo of kevdak that's disgusting general leather armor quarterstaff you do find one potion of greater healing he did not have the opportunity to try that's all he has on him okay make a tinkering check good all right there's already a fire going well it's slower-burning embers now one of the barricades that had been set fire by the fireball earlier okay so you take the bodies of the dead villagers that had been lost in the battle and the handful of the other combatants that had fallen and you throw them onto the fire and it crackles and burns over time the smell of burning bodies fills the space around it for a while there are three lingering that are keeping an eye sure very well these two stay though no offense but you did just kill one of my friends naught but an hour ago there were three herd members that were keeping an eye-- two of them are goliaths one of them is human the human and the other goliath stay behind the one you talked to walks off and seems to be following through on what you told him to do now thunderlord zanror did you want to look over the items you found on kevdak there's your bloodaxe and there's your titanstone knuckles no doesn't seem to be anything holding you there other than the ritual that was done when the ritual's completed you're welcome to go about what you're doing at which point you do see as time has passed a few people start poking through windows who apparently were either hiding in some of these buildings and see you guys and check out and then go back into hiding again the town still has people living throughout it many of them stay hidden whenever things move in their vicinity so all right so as you guys gather yourselves partially rested and breathing a sigh of relief at the not horrible circumstance that nearly transpired there thanks to the luck of the gods in a lot of cases you make your way northward through westruun toward the temple district small child at your side with the intent-- on trinket by your side and possibly to prepare for whatever the herd has in store for dawn and with that we'll finish tonight's game he by the way on that hold person that cutting words/hold person like that's exactly what that-- yeah no kevdak hadn't used his action surge yet kevdak hadn't used his action surge yet multi it's what he does he can do four attacks in one round with the bloodaxe no couldn't make his save his arms were gone by the time he came around plus he had four more superiority die and the riposte ability so he could-- when a creature misses him with a melee attack he can use one of his superiority die to do a reaction attack as well so he could in theory get five attacks in one round yeah that hold person really changed the dynamic really fast and honestly mucking it up with the archers helped too because they were all about to start focus-firing on whoever was visible getting grog out was key if you hadn't pulled him out and taken all those attacks of opportunity you would be gone they weren't going to stop when you hit zero they were going to cut you up until you were dead what it's okay bunch of dudes you guys have dragons to deal with all right well guys thank you very much for watching thanks again for loot crate for being awesome and being our sponsor-- if-- i dunno if he's still around is our guest still around yeah it's ww (stammers) wwwloot cratecom/criticalrole they didn't coordinate with wyrmwood that's fantastic all right well in the meantime we'll be back next week to see what this next chapter in the westruun portion of this adventure holds well done guys that's the largest battlefield i've made so far is he-- he's not here (groans of disappointment)
