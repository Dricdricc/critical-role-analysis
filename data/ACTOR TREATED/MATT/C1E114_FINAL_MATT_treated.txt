onward as we dive into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] you're not entirely certain as you guys are ascending you begin to see a peek of greenish light that's peeking up ahead starting to brighten the spiral staircase as you ascend you get the sense you're getting close the secondary scanlan takes a moment looks at you nods okay truer words were never spoken and if you fall i'll tell the tale of the scanlan that left me with his number two whip i love you too you're not sure if you should go in for a kiss or not for the record as the ascent and the time it's cast you'll probably arrive at the top of the tower with about-- for the purposes of gameplay and time wishy-washiness i'll give you about 30 seconds once the encounter starts in which the haste will remain 25 to 30 interesting point of order they don't have to be within 30 feet of you for it to affect you it looks like as long as they're within 30 feet of you when you cast it then you guys can run anywhere attack rolls heading up the stairs the greenish light of the surface greets you as you break toward the top of the tower this ascent is somewhat familiar to keyleth having seen this exact arrival once before as you were originally scrying on the death knight as soon as you hit the peak the wind sends your hair behind you and scattering across your face as you can see the extremely strong cyclone that encapsulates the top of this tower is now swirling around you there are occasional breaks in the clouds where you see glimpses of the sprawling city of vasselheim right below you you see the titan's feet have already breached the outer walls and have begun crushing their way through the braving grounds of the city columns of smoke swirl upward to engulf the behemoth's legs with each impact you get the sense the entire city is leaned forward as it's begun to assault thousands upon thousands of soldiers that have swarmed up toward the base of the creature you can see arrow and spell being flung from a distance you can see other flying soldiers wyvern-riders eagle-riders across the way that are crashing into gloomstalker clouds that are swooping down to engulf the skies above the city as the four giant arms of this titan continue to pummel and smash tossing large towers and temples breaking into bits of rubble and rock you can see hundreds of warriors man siege weapons against this unstoppable ancient threat as giant rocks and boulders go flying past slamming the sides of the giant dome that still remain holding however there you can see the large wedge that you had already left free and open where the soldiers that managed to break through the initial onslaught of the gloomstalkers are beginning to swarm in and try and make their way in your direction bolts of green energy crackle and fork through the swirling clouds around you your eyes creep upward to lock onto the terrifying avatar form of vecna the ascended the undying king-made-god is now a huge skeletal lich body floating about 40 feet above the tower staring down at you tendrils of screaming souls entwined within his limbs and the tome he has clutched in his right hand stretching with every gesture you see the faces screech and cry in pain as they're withered and torn as his arms shift downward to greet you the gaping left socket is almost blinding with crackling power arcs of arcane tethers crawling across his chest and face his left hand however is whole seemingly recovered a part of his previous power the hand of vecna appears to have been reattached the artifact now pulses with the same green energy that sparks from his voided socket across his long tattered red robes and his dark golden armor his ribcage glows from within sending beams of sickly green light out at each gap and there floating in the bones the faint outline of a small humanoid form locked within make a perception check everyone ooh nice so you five look up to see an unconscious little girl of human and elven descent velora floats encased within the ribcage of the avatar form she appears to be in some sort of a trance and is held by nothing but air and energy a terrible familiar smile creeps across the face his thin mummified lips curling into an impossibly long exaggerated smile that defies the constraints of the skull that held it i was curious who would seek my blessing first you all have proven driven enough to deserve the personal touch of my wrath when i discovered your wily tricks merely shifting about beneath my nose the humor of it was not lost on me this omniscience is still new i learned to push my limits with each passing moment i thank you for showing me i reward you by sharing with you the ruin of this once beautiful city a familiar oblivion to you each now perfected i would like you all to please place yourselves you've arrived place yourselves around this entrance in what order you would've ascended to this point i'll show you once you place yourselves based on how you ascended unless you wanted to scatter let's say about anywhere from 15 to 20 feet from where the entrance is as you rush out to look over the side of the wall all right we have percival over here so i'll say over here you can get about this far for just the ascension i'll say you can do that as he's speaking then (whooshing) there's grog we'll say you can get for the sake of placement about 20 feet up to this side because you have your wings out sure i'll let you get there right there well i had friends help me because i've been planning a wedding that was actually converted from my critter gift a while back yeah so even the community helped so to give you some perspective in size to his newly ascended avatar form all of his power focused into a single physical entity that is the vecna produced since the ritual of seeding i would like you all to roll initiative (screaming) it's an ability check i think right there we go now we got the music going all right so 30 to 25 25 to 20 20 to 15 and percival 15 to ten ten to five if you want to vecna goes first as he stands above he lifts his hand you watch as the atmosphere above at the outskirts of this cyclone above the city a tear in space and time begins to rip a familiar sound you've heard once before you watch as giant flaming rocks three of them go firing down into vasselheim you watch as the apex of the temple of kord gets impacted and crumbles down to one side in a flaming ruin you watch as a secondary one slams down into the center of the city in a familiar district to you pike and a third one goes arcing off towards the temple of the raven queen and with a distant explosion the flash encompasses that vicinity this is what you would notice if the fourth one didn't come flying straight for the top of the tower as it slams into the center of the tower apex i need everybody to make a dexterity saving throw that's correct that's correct so go ahead and roll the damage grog is yes so what did you get yes fail success success fail fail just succeeds with a skill set with a saving throw i generally consider a natural 20 an auto-success but letting you know that's still barely a pass 26 he just made it pike what did you roll so everyone who failed you take 67 points of bludgeoning damage halved if you succeeded and 66 points of fire damage 67 and 66 yeah correct uncanny dodge is for a melee attack bludgeoning and fire we'll say 66 points of damage is what you take also pike and anybody with a concentration spell i need you to make a concentration check you do not because you did not take any damage it's a constitution saving throw with half the damage no so holy aura fades 27 you maintain concentration wait no because half the damage would be 33 you do not there's too much damage no you're right wait you took 30-- i'm sorry you took half damage from everything no it's still 66 so you guys do drop your spells unfortunately that's okay figure out the math here because it sunders the tower if i could get somebody to take this off here for me all right so using the photo replication of this i also need everyone to make a strength saving throw please sorry it's in the wrong direction no anyone who's flying doesn't have to worry about it necessarily doesn't have to make the strength saving throw so as that detonates and sends it this way that puts us-- no he's immune to prone you guys all got slammed and scattered across this tower from the explosion where he is now currently uses his movement to shift over here and move up so after the explosion hits the ringing in your ear begins to subside your vision returns and you look about the now-broken tower you've grabbed on to what you can so strength saving throws for those who weren't flying so everybody but scanlan makes the save so scanlan with the detonation you get thrown off the side of the tower and begin to plummet off the side so i'll put you right there for the time being from the impact of it moving back that's going to end vecna's turn grog you're up first sure also did you roll 4d6 damage how much was it 12 points of radiant damage to him the flash hits he floats up and now you can see he chuckles looking down at the destruction the green tendrils of energy the vein-like projections that have been clutching the tower together are now extending out like tethers grasping the bottom of each floating island that used to be the top of entropis as they slowly shift held in place and rotate around the storm still cycling around you yeah they're floating now held in place by these green tethers and they're slowly shifting grog you're up yeah make an athletics check 28 yeah easy you leap over it would be 20 feet of movement okay sure go for it 31 hits so as you're getting the chain as you leap over and go running across the platforms you can see the entire platform is lilted to one side and some stones are tumbling and skidding off the side you can see bits of the stone are charred from the immediate destruction and impact of the meteors and as you pull the chain out as you rush and attach it the voice pulses through your head yes he's here right there kill him take him down deliver me yes necrotic all right so 37 points of slashing damage all right with that you toss the blade up into the side oh and you see for a second there's a brief flash of recognition and a slight sliver of worry on his brow for but an instant before his hand reaches up and grabs towards to try and pull the blade out okay so you pull it back and make your attack 27 that hits 35 points of slashing damage as you draw the blade back for the second swing and you rotate it as it goes i can taste him and you fling it upward and it pierces once more into the abdomen each time you begin to grow more and more nervous with the proximity of the blade towards the currently unconscious and contained little girl inside the chest others may you may be fine but it's passing within like a foot of her each time inside the chest cavity second time as it hits there's another flash of dark energy are you withdrawing it okay make another check to pull it out yeah contained in it yeah you pull it back is that your turn you do hold on no i'm sorry because you used-- correct sure yeah i'm thinking for this because it's not like the hammer you throw up returns every single time it's like you impact and then you have to pull it back each time yeah so i'd say you attack then you used your hasted action to pull it back and let's say you-- bonus action threw it in so it's actually still in him so it's currently embedded in him with the chain now taut at the maximum length he's now 30 feet above you 35 technically but you're in large mode make an athletics check 19 yeah that'll work as you run and leap and bound you manage to catch the edge let me check real fast actually a number of feet up to your strength score if you move at least ten feet on foot so-- yeah so you don't have to roll for that you can move 26 feet with a jump as long as you get ten feet of run-up because of your speed so yeah you leap across without issue the chain is taut as you tarzan-swing across the way and land on the other side still holding on to it delicious he's talking to you from a distance at the end your turn vecna's going to use two legendary actions-- laura and yes to cast a spell as a reaction as you glance past oh no we cannot let that stay near and as he pulls out and opens his hands i need you to go ahead grog and make a-- actually you don't make a saving throw grog vanishes from the battlefield gone you watch as this space closes around it grog you suddenly appear in a darkened tunnel of some kind you look around and you can see hard walls to each point and ahead of you it splits in two different directions behind you it splits into three different directions it looks completely unfamiliar two ahead of you and then three behind you no you've never seen this place before in your life nope that's the end of grog's turn vex you're up do enough damage to make him drop concentration that's what you did last time to bring him back hunter's mark vecna all right bonus action oh god that's not helping go for it roll for the attack 30 that hits sure you are you got lobbed off the side from the explosion and the tower crumbling beneath you you couldn't find purchase you grabbed part of the stone and your fingers slid and scraped off that is-- okay he's going to burn a legendary resistance he does not want to be restrained right now so he burns off that so that was a total of 41 damage so half that so he's going to make a concentration check yeah he succeeds that's 22 he had to roll a 20 25 piercing damage oh 25 to hit i'm sorry yes that hits 19 points of damage no what it does is it bypasses or can hit creatures that normally are immune to non-magical weapons like those ghosts and things so it doesn't have an additional effect that you can see from it unfortunately so how much damage was it okay yeah he does make his save still so as the two arrows swish past and slam into part of his neck it seems to pass through a period where it's just energy a second one whisks through the bottom of his body-- all right 20 and he glances down at you the eye flashes oh don't worry i'm coming for you soon enough that end your turn (laughter) that's amazing you've taken enough care through aiming to not strike anywhere near who you recognize within he would be considered gargantuan why well you have the powerful build so you're considered large and you can grapple one size larger than that okay perfect that ends your turn vecna end of your turn is going to use a third legendary action to use a firebolt against-- let's say against you since you just shot him so spell attack that is a 35 to hit yeah it's 4d10 nope it's a firebolt a cantrip 21 points of fire damage to you as the bolt slams into you go for it rolls for concentration natural one he's going to go ahead and use his legendary resistance to maintain it that's going to finish your turn i believe i'm sorry all right vax you're up next correct from that distance about 45 feet yeah about ten feet 24 hits yes that would be a different roll then we'd have to roll again okay 44 points of damage natural 18 he makes his concentration check he's immune to poison sorry how many points that ends your turn he's going to continue on now we're on the initiative count 20 yes the dead rise bits of scattered bone and corpses that litter the top of this tower many of which have been thrust off in the explosion and charred and destroyed from the impact others begin to clack together and rise nine skeletons rise from the ground nine of them all righty so those two take an attack against you vex that is 18 now against percival it's a natural 20 you take ten points of slashing damage as the skeleton pulls this rusted scimitar to the side and rakes it across your chest then against keyleth a natural three is not going to hit against pike an 18 is not going to hit against you vax that doesn't hit i think that's it they'd have to hit though that is going to finish the lair action scanlan two is up he is currently clutching on the side of this so he didn't have to worry about watching the whip drop it's the rest of the tower make a general athletics check for him 11 does he want to try and inspire himself it's an ability check okay roll a d12 and add to it no add the roll to it 14 is just enough it's not super hard to climb this you get just to the edge there and that's all your movement for him did he use his bonus action well it's not inspiring it's giving yourself the use of an ability check it does not cost you a bonus action your peerless skill does not correct for scanlan two because he has his own pool okay laura and he was resistant to lightning damage last time technically level five fireball okay where does bigby's hand appear 28 hits roll damage 4d8 and you cast it at 5th-level no damage actually bigby's hand slams towards him and impacts to no effect you get the sense that only a certain level of magic can break past his magical barrier you watch as bigby's hand slams into him to no effect and pulls back and you're like that's not good make an intelligence check that sucks you can do that all right so take your d12 inspiration die is that the end of scanlan two's turn all right at the end of his turn vecna's going to use his last two legendary actions yeah to cast another spell as he sees scanlan one go flying down off the edge and scanlan two climb up he glances down and goes you clever little gnome he's going to attempt to dispel at 8th-level okay go ahead and roll oh at 8th-level it means that it nullifies the spell he was dispelling at 6th-level you watch the undying king in his magnificent horrible form lean forward going what ugh prepares for whatever he has coming up next that's the end of that keyleth you're up where do you want to place it how many does it create well grog is not on the field you don't see grog anywhere okay so constitution saving throw rolled a natural three no he's going to take it he's used two legendary resistances no he's used two he's immune to blind unfortunately he rolled a four no he's going to burn his third legendary resistance to maintain he tasted that sword he does not want you on that field you also notice as the detonation of radiant energy blasts his form ugh he withdraws a bit and you can see the energy flicker and dropping from within his ribcage you watch as a slightly burned unmoving little girl begins to fall out of him she's plummeting through this crack straight down so keyleth you're going to stay where you are around there okay so there you are that ends your turn all right percival you're up 20 hits yep you're on deck okay as the skeleton lunges towards you you put the barrel of the gun-- oh this is the sword i see as you do it cuts right through and bones go scattering off the side as it's destroyed okay so you (sheathes sword gunshot) that hits roll damage for the purposes of this this is velora plummeting down as it's scraping at your betrothed you fire the gun and watch as the skeleton skull blasts clean off the rest of the body it scratches one more time before it clatters into a pile of lifeless bones there's three over there one over there and three over there that are waiting he takes damage from magical weapons animus is okay as a bonus action hexed that hits count the lightning damage separately all right that's 31 total for that he's going to make a concentration check natural 18 he's fine you notice both the blasts of lightning and the dark necrotic energy seem to be partially wounding but not on the level you'd expect nope just passes through one of the open spaces in the ribs sharpshooter 19 this one actually hits the armor and reflects off that hits that is a 22 so this final shot hits him and he barely feels an impact and grins down at you as a baneful gaze curling across the floor he's now aware of your presence he did he succeeded okay so that moves you up to there that's your turn end of percival's turn scanlan as you are now off the edge you can see the edge of the tower vanishing away from you the cyclone whirling above part of it catches you on the way out as you hit the edge of the cyclone that's circulating it go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw at disadvantage because you're falling 19 okay so you take half damage would've been 16 points of piercing damage from the shrapnel being spun around it you instead take eight as you're falling for what check are you doing that for yeah one creature other than yourself and you have the ability peerless skill which means when you're making an ability check you can add bardic inspiration to it no so in this alternate reality you're singing under your breath trying to build your resolve as you-- you're up next pike by the way be ready with that there's a burst of purplish arcane energy as your eyes are trained on the massive god-like form of vecna and there in the vacuous space where velora once was encased you see a familiar gnome's form appear in that pocket so you are currently-- we'll put you there say you're in the space okay so you're on the edge of the rib cage 60 feet from there i would say maybe maybe vex there you go not wasted never a song wasted yes you could try bigby's hand is pulled back currently being controlled by the other scanlan you could try and leap into it no because both you and bigby's hand are technically right up against him so you're still holding on to him or-- sam i'm going to see if i can hold onto both okay that's your turn pike no let's see it looks like scanlan two vax keyleth and trinket are within 30 feet of you go ahead and roll a saving throw yep trinket is in your necklace yeah he just took about 130 points of damage can do that so you fly up yeah i'll take this down a little bit there there we go that'll put you there okay the range on that is that'll be vex pike and keyleth sorry scanlan two can't heal so what did you roll so pike what was the end total did you add the ten for your blessing so 39 points healed to vex percy and keyleth yeah don't forget the blessing you have means whenever you heal anybody they heal an additional ten points (laughs) does that end your turn pike you have your bonus action still okay you've moved about 40 feet so what's your flying speed that's okay i'm pretty sure-- that's okay i have it right here blessing of the everlight yep flying speed of 40 feet so you've moved your maximum speed while flying and you've used your action to cast you can't move any further there you go all right that ends your turn pike up to the top of the round it is now vecna's turn gets his legendary actions back vecna looking at the field around you can hear now the distant blasts and impacts of the battle below in vasselheim you see this giant looming shadow as one of the large mountain-sized arms of the titan swings in the air and causes this brief eclipse over and then slams down into the center of the city you see dust rock and probably a dozen bodies flung in the air from the impact as they drift out of sight below glancing at this he starts chuckling to himself as the small gnome is crawling across the body and reaching out to the hand i do wish most of these creatures would find their way straight to me it's so much easier however he looks off past you but you've always been an issue you're how you all escaped from my clutches last time well how's this for a bit of irony my dear yeah 120 feet you're in range i need you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw keyleth yes you can yes an intelligence saving throw this is true he has to choose to counter-- make an arcana check because you are ioun-- his restored hand is reaching out towards her as he glances down with a grin you've seen it used before against a green dragon you once fought you have not cast this spell you do not know okay it's an 8th-level spell so you still have to roll so i need you to go ahead and roll-- i need you to roll your spellcasting ability so roll and add your charisma bonus 22 that'll be enough (exclamations of relief) no as you finish the incantation the spell fizzles his hand out really he's glaring at you and with that come for a ride with me (whooshing) and begins to rise up even higher into the air okay go for it it's okay lost the hex there we go it'll be fine and you putting you right around here as he adjusts upward and you're clutching onto bigby's hand what are you doing as your attack of opportunity sure go for it it's an action to do it correct since i don't have a second bigby's hand i'll go ahead and put this as scanlan two's bigby hand with you and where do you want to place this one there you go there is the bigby's hand three stooges bops him on the head go for it correct go ahead and roll to hit nope so bigby's hand goes to bop and as it impacts-- ability checks it seems to hit but it gets carried up with vecna's form and it stands there in front of him the fingers crack themselves and get ready for the next round that's going to end vecna's turn grog you're up you're trying to make your way through this maze i need you to make an intelligence check let me see if it's intelligence check or intelligence save it's an intelligence check so go ahead and roll a d20 add your intelligence modifier yes you rolled a two okay you spend the round rushing down-- you see the left you turn left and run ten feet and it looks like the same hallway you were just in so you rush forward and turn right and you end up and it looks like it's in the same hallway you were in it seems to be this perpetual maze that you can't seem to escape from there you go all righty grog that ends your turn vex you're up so you dart down-- --with the broom you can get to her but it'll take your movement and your action okay you swoop down manage to grab her body and you have her now in your arms no there is part of the tower where it impacted there's still the stairway it's just cusping up in the bottom of one of these pieces so there's a little bit there if you want to try and toss her then wait until next turn all right that ends your turn okay you can do that pretty easily you're pretty much on the same level as scanlan and bigby you're able to get there yeah the first attack was with disadvantage because you're aiming for something specifically okay you watch as the tome that he's holding spatters into pages and he's like huh you destroyed the tome right 17 29 hits 25 to hit that hits succeeds on a save he hit him twice to get where you are right here is for-- because you're hasted so-- yeah so no it took you about 60 feet to get there you're right here currently right about there we'll say so tome's destroyed the daggers seem to slide into him he maintains concentration that ends your turn okay let's see here marisha laura and okay end of your turn-- end of your turn he's going to go ahead and use two of his legendary actions all right seems the battlefield has been expended as he glares down at the gnome and the other gnome let's try this again make an intelligence saving throw with advantage but it hasn't come back to his turn nope so as the spell energy whips out from his hand and entwines-- taliesin and that's what it's there for the cocked die argument was not resolved you guys just rolled we'll move forward with it but cutthroat from here on out sacrifice all your lucks if you want to i was thinking it's fine you resist the spell no effect no impact we're moving on it's all good you're fine that then brings us to the initiative count 20 first off the currently existing skeletons all swarm in on keyleth as the only one standing that's three attacks on you that is 12 18 and no so you get one hit that's seven points of slashing damage to you also you feel this pulse wave of dark energy swell out from outside of vecna in the vicinity it cascades out encompassing the entirety of the area and then fades and all of you feel a little colder on the inside for the next round anybody with resistance to necrotic damage it's negated yep at this point in time you hear this roar as the clouds suddenly explode and part from the nearby cyclone and you watch as two gloomstalkers come swarming outward wounded one of them slaps into the side of one of the islands and collapses a second one suddenly gets snatched in the jaws of what now you see a sparkling brass dragon emerge from the side as j'mon sa ord flies in glances right up in the form of devo'ssa towards vecna and shouts out in a deep bellowing dragon voice your time is done old one fall before us all (snarls roars) and unleashes a torrent of flame upward in the direction of both vecna and bigby's hand so let's see that is going to be dc 21 does not make the save so that's 56 points of fire damage yep which he does not make he's going to use his fourth legendary resistance to maintain it he does not want you on that field grog no he has a total of legendary resistances he can use per day legendary actions he gets every single round correct well a dexterity saving throw if he gets one nope nope 56 points of damage it's okay bigby's hand has hit points equal to your hit point maximum so yeah yeah okay as soon as j'mon roars and shows up vecna turns around oh no we cannot have this at the end of j'mon's turn-- he's going to look about the field and consider what the current importance is and instead glance downward and use two more legendary actions to cast dispel on your simulacrum understanding that you do not have any reactions to counter it's two to cast a spell and with dispel magic is going to go ahead and cast it at 5th-level nope so at 6th-level it's an 8th-level spell correct simulacrum oh but you cast it as an-- right but it just creates the spell so it'd be 9th so with his 5th-level he'd still have to make an ability check using the spellcasting ability which is-- it's ability modifier yeah so he has disadvantage that's a natural 20 but with disadvantage second one was a 13 plus ten that's a 23 that's enough so with that second scanlan is dispelled off the field well no this bigby's hand yes actually yes it's a concentration spell so you start falling once more as bigby's hand vanishes you watch as scanlan two melts into snow and water onto the ground dripping off the clothing and items that he had clattering and rolling off into oblivion and you begin plummeting so you would fall to about there you'd fall prone one thing i'll put you there laying you prone because otherwise you'll slide and you suffer-- you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone nope all right scanlan two is gone keyleth it's your turn okay what are you changing into he's going to use his-- well no what's the range on counterspell you're too far for him to counterspell so you transform without an issue that is your action yes yep what do you do where are you going keyleth in the air i know there you go okay is that your turn keyleth i mean i don't think he has anything to do as a bonus all right that ends your turn percy you're up yeah that hits hits you're up after this scanlan 17 points of damage plus four psychic scattered and destroyed okay he also is destroyed you can you can't combine different abilities that spend grit points but you can combine sharpshooter which is a feat with any attacks you make so you're just using one point for violent which violent shot which is double dice from your weapon correct correct you double so it's 11 that's 22 okay so how much dice does it do per shot it's a d10 right it's 2d10 right yeah great so what's the total right and how much damage is that total okay 57 points all righty no that's a failure on his concentration he's not going to use his legendary resistance he feels pretty comfortable high up so with that grog's giant form reappears right where he left right there the maze disappears around you and you land back on the space looking around your friends are in different places there's a giant brass dragon above you you see an angel flying above and you can see on the ground hurting-- scanlan anywhere you want to move anything else you want to do correct so that'll be 23 points next turn got it 24 hits that is a 17 so-- how much does he drop does it say oh does it say prone he's immune to prone no as it says on a hit the target takes normal damage and must make a strength saving throw or be knocked prone which would affect things normally if they were flying but he's immune to prone so next round he takes a total of 39 points of damage automatically from the hemorrhaging shot so as each shot (impacts) the crit hits and you watch him go (snarling) and as that impact hits you watch as part of the armor cracks and there's a brief little wound in the shoulder where you see a glow of energy behind you see the brief a tiny little chink in the armor of his avatar form okay that ends your turn scanlan you're up yep all right that's a bonus action go for it if you wanted to generally i think it's supposed to be like you can as a bonus action cause it to do again so your action has to be something else that's her blessing from the everlight so only she gets that it's plus ten to whatever she heals that's part of the gift she got from her god above the deck let's see-- 75 feet up he casts polymorph oh shit all right yeah so you'll have half of your eagle's fly form he's pretty heavy in his large size so i would say-- you're at half speed while he's on your back even your fly speed what's the fly speed of the eagle and you used half your movement so you can get 20 feet up yeah we'll put you there and we'll say you're at 20 feet i'll acknowledge that here i need to put tape on the eagle i can fix that i came prepared all righty well thank you wait until the battle's over before you thank me i mean it would have taken a couple rounds but you've already made your choices because it's a concentration spell yeah i know all righty so ending scanlan's turn pike you're up guiding bolt at 6th-level all right make a ranged spell attack pike yeah it's 120 feet so you're in range no it means you have to roll a d20 and then add your ranged spell attack modifier yeah so you can move a little closer but you have-- he's in range you have 120-foot range so you don't have to get closer but you can if you'd like to okay i'll say for the purposes of-- we'll know that j'mon is up there marisha and keeping an eye at that point there pike will rise up and move closer still to about there all right and what'd you roll it doubles damage yeah it's one of the few ways you can crit with spell damage is if it's a ranged spell attack so go ahead and roll your damage roll 9d6 times two 72 points of radiant damage and the next attack on him has advantage you watch as pike her wings expanded flies up in the direction as she does she glances upward clutching the holy symbol of sarenrae in her hand her eyes which have already been glowing since she brought the blessing upon her physical form now begin to burst with vibrant energy as she extends her hand in front you watch as a singular comet of divine wrath rockets upward slamming into the front of vecna's chest as the impact hits he screams out and as he looks down you can see the anger of his eye flaring the energy now sparking outward with sheer hatred and you can see the area of the chest where percy had hit and slightly exposed a wound there's now a gaping wound in the chest where the guiding bolt has hit and now the energy is crackling across his body guiding the next attack against him so that's 74 points of damage all righty cool all right pike that's your action and your move anything else you want to do you can get maybe down ten feet as an eagle technically he's at full health as an eagle yes grog and scanlan are within range of you okay so roll 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier to yourself scanlan's at full health as an eagle okay so 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier to grog end of your turn vecna's going to use a fifth and final legendary action to cast firebolt again that's going to be-- oh man it's going to go for the eagle seeing the massive man holding the sword bent on his destruction in his hand wants to stop that ascension he pulled it back or he would have gone with him when he transported to the maze that is a 30 it hits 25 points of fire damage so you have one hit point left that ends pike's turn top of the round vecna gets all his legendary actions back vecna who sees you all swarming upward says i've enjoyed toying with you playing and all this fantastical experience of seeing what you're capable of but you've severely angered me he clutches up with his hand across where the wound is let's end this now with his other hand raising up you can see the stitch marks on the flesh of the reformed hand of vecna begin to bulge and as he does the sky above you cracks open a second time as large arcane meteors come slamming down from above (singing) more than one 9th-level spell he is a fucking god to the ground so that's a 40-foot radius so it would hit scanlan and grog pike as it impacts here pike you're just out of range of the explosions your planetar form however is caught in the blast radius so everybody but pike and vex are affected by this this is another 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage i need dexterity saving throws from everybody who was affected are you using your reaction on this one scanlan that's a failure grog failure 31 success both failures so that is 61 points of bludgeoning damage and 71 points of fire damage correct so 132 points of damage unless you have resistance against one or the other yeah so it would be 30 and 71 so you take 101 points of damage in your planetar form so you take 65 66 66 we'll say you take the bulk of that the eagle takes the one and you transform and you both plummet back down from where you were hitting the ground scanlan is unconscious scanlan is unconscious on the ground but you do have death ward (cheering) all righty so grog took that keyleth you've marked that down as well the damage from that one all right percival since it's a 9th-level spell you gain nine charges and with that knowing the circumstance vecna is going to arrange himself across the battlefield to this side all right that's going to end vecna's turn and for the sake that it is now 900 let's take a quick bathroom break we're starting up at grog's turn we'll be right back here guys we'll see you back here in just a minute we'll make it quick because we've got to rush in fast hold tight and we'll see where the rest of this battle will go see you guys in a minute [break] congratulations twoorthreegodzillas enjoy dividing it amongst yourselves hope it's a good time for you small box for a big creature well done so bringing it back in last we left off vecna had just sent down another blast of arcane meteors pulled from beyond the realm slamming into the ground and sundering many of you sending scanlan into a point of near death where he popped back thanks to an aptly cast death ward in preparation for this combat vecna's round has ended with him shifting over to the opposite side of the battlefield grog you're up if you were here and had gone straight up then fell back down which technically would have dealt nine points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four because you're ever raging you've landed on the ground vecna i'd say probably 80 feet from down there what action are you holding to pour it into something else's mouth is an action but yourself is a bonus that's one of the house rules we started the campaign with up to you if you want to apply it to scanlan-- he's at one hit point on the ground so you're holding your attack action okay that ends your turn at the end of grog's turn vecna will use his first legendary action-- okay so you move right there gotcha at the end of your turn vecna going to use two legendary actions actually and across the way is going to glance over at the brass dragon that's there who's flying up in the space here but all the platforms and vecna staring about at everything on the battlefield you make me uncomfortable with your presence ancient one and is going to cast-- i believe this space is large enough for gargantuan-- nope instead he's going to create a forcecage around j'mon no saving throw necessary you watch as j'mons wings through their flapping are pulled in as a similar cage to what you saw of force energy deeper within the tower has now encased the brass dragon's form you see j'mon in their devo'ssa form is now held within this forcecage aloft within the air the dragon begins slamming into each side and momentarily seems to be trying to figure out a way to escape nope so up here in this space is a brass dragon currently encased in a forcecage so that brings us back to vex's turn you can tuck her in a place where it was once a solid piece of stone that cracked there is an element of what was once solid packed stone that was the central column of the tower that is now exposed broken rock and the staircase that spirals around it before it abruptly ends and tendrils of green energy begin that hold the platforms aloft she's dead as you grab her body and pull up to the edge to look for a place you look down and there is no breath you go ahead and set her aside down below in an area where it's safe and you fly up and at your full fly speed you can get to the edge of one of these platforms i would say to carefully set her down that would be your action and your movement but you'd get back into the fray to be fair helping going after velora did manage to avoid you a impact of a meteor storm what i'd say is you'd come up this way and hide behind the wall i'll place you here but we'll assume you're behind yes good to know that bring us at the end of your turn he's now going to spend another legendary action to cast firebolt at scanlan one legendary action for cantrips two for a full spell well you're prone so he has disadvantage on the attack roll what's the range on cutting words he's not within range so that's a 28 to hit you suffer-- 17 points of fire damage and are now unconscious once more that brings us to vax's turn yes you are okay yes and you're now currently-- yes on his face which in his form his head is roughly that large so you'd be clutching his ears you can feel the crackling energy of the gaping socket where the greenish arcane bursts are pulsing from the anger and sheer ability of his arcane prowess each one of these tendrils is arcing around two of them crawl across you and your skin goes numb in the places where they touch and it's cold wait hold on a second you used your action to-- hasted action can only be used as an attack hide object or-- that hits and he's undead so you get the additional smite damage it's an extra 1d8 woo 63 points of damage as you rush up wings up before right in the face pull back and jam your blade into the side of the skull as it hits you can see the skull crack open like a spider web of wound as you pull the blade back you can see the sutures are already pulling themselves together and as you're this close to him now you can see there is a slow binding of wounds there is an element of regeneration to his body apparently in his god-like ascension the body itself continually rebuilds level six divinity i'll take that feat you have to roll to hit first yeah that hits it's not whisper but you didn't throw it so the dice sorry buddy he did the 39 points of damage that's a nasty crit 14 points so as you rush up and jam the blade in the side the second time and pull back-- i know it's all good so as you jam the second blade in and pull back he lets you draw the blade and a grin now curls back at which point you watch as the wound that was blasted in the shoulder pulses and you can see the gunshot wound suddenly causes some of the more bones in the clavicle area that are now exposed from the impact crack leftover the hemorrhaging shot from percival earlier and he's like (grumble) hello you can smell this wave of decay and as it brushes past you you can actually feel this weird crawling sensation like the air itself is beginning to pull at your flesh and that's your turn all right he is going to-- vecna's going to use his last two legendary actions as you stab in the face as his hand comes up in front the hand which now the long skeletal fingers unwind to be larger than the full of your entire body and almost your wingspan it's almost like the fingers expand longer than they should and he says goodnight bitch's prince and there's like a flash of dark and you see this wave of cold necrotic energy come to you i need you to go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw no yep 24 does not succeed i'm sorry you suffer-- however unfortunately the wave of energy that expanded last round 20 count negated that so you take 36 points of necrotic damage from circle of death oh sorry it should've been an extra d6 on that so add three to that because there's 2d6 every additional spell level that brings us to the 20 initiative count j'mon desperately trying does not have the spellcasting prowess of other dragons you've encountered and begins to thrust their body side to side against the forcecage unable to escape roaring angrily within the confines of the spell as it clusters in the entirety of this majestic dragon's form into this small box held aloft in this space to the side of the ruined tower at this point in time you see as the spiraling cyclone around you is whirling and you hear screeches in the distance and you watch as flying creatures four of them begin to emerge from the sides of it you see from the back two heavily wounded gloomstalkers giving chase to two wyverns that are damaged in their own right flying in on the back there are two soldiers coming in as the darkness begins to fade past you can see the red skin and dark horns the white hair of zahra riding on the side of this wyvern and behind her kashaw riding in as well (yelling) you do see as they swarm in the two other gloomstalkers close behind both of them appear at first glance they themselves are scratched you see bloodied in the faces they've been through an onslaught to even break through to the top of the tower as you see them ride into the brief but crackling light from the surrounding magical aura of the tower you have seemingly a cavalry at hand so what would you guys like to do you hear (screeching) behind you two of the gloomstalkers that have been chasing you have also pushed through the cyclone seemingly unaffected by its torrent you guys are right here your full move was to get to that edge of the tower and right now you each have an action what are you going to do from each of you he would be about 55 feet all right so he has to make a constitution saving throw that is a 17 so he takes 7d8 plus 30 necrotic damage so go ahead and roll 7d8 68 points of necrotic damage halved because he is resistant to necrotic damage 34 points of necrotic damage as you reach up you watch as the beam of sickly green energy slams into the back of vecna as he's spun around you saw the eye for a second but in the flurry of realizing you're there he spins and it manages to catch him in the back of the shoulder oh how quaint i learned that when i was but a child what are you doing kashaw yeah vax is flying up in his face right now it took your full movement to get to this spot so you have your action for the turn within your current range you have percival grog and-- what's the range on it so with that you can hit either grog percy and scanlan or vex grog and scanlan you can double hex by the way i need you to make a concentration check because you did take a shit-ton of damage it would've been because you took half of it so it would've been 60-- so you have to beat a 33 constitution all right so yeah so your hex is gone but zahra's hex is up 20 hit points to scanlan grog and percival all right anything with your bonus action or you good that ends your turn all right also at this point the stones begin to shift you watch as the tether that holds the various columns begins to separate and then begin to rotate so this island begins to move this tower begins to separate to there this begins to push away yeah shifted outward like ah what toward grog i'd say you need about 50 feet to get to grog 50 feet of your movement you get down to where grog is what are you doing what's the strength of your planetar yeah you could yeah you could probably do that roll a strength check for me if you don't mind so you swoop down arm underneath grog's shoulders it's your action do that i'll say grab and get hold and then-- you get him about there i don't think you have a bonus to dash unfortunately you've already used your action unfortunately that would be an action to try and do that we'll say for the purposes of this-- i know this is kind of crazy you guys are about ten feet below no it's casting a spell so you'd have to say you were holding that okay so as you're pulled up and you're just out of range you see the wings beginning to falter at the end of the round you lob the sword up as you're preparing it once again the sword's voice pulses into your ears kill him take him throw me no hurry 31 hits 43 whew okay so as you swing the sword of kas upward it lodges right into the side of the ribcage and up into the spinal column where this little bits of hanging mummified flesh you watch as a flash of energy hits in a blast of necrotic angry dark energy the sword immediately says in the back of your mind yes as vecna (sounds of pain) grasps the blade on the other end where it's jammed through and looks down at you you can see this point of grin of you're going to continue to be a problem won't you so the sword is embedded in his body you do see where it's embedded a secondary spark of that glowing light is beginning to emerge you don't no it's just in there keyleth end of your turn all right percival you're up 29 to hit okay that hits go ahead and roll damage i get a sinking sense that bones of the earth isn't going to happen however if anyone wants some really cool stone pillars-- easy to make with a dowel and a dremel guys recommend it it's great okay as it's flying (screeching) it looks heavily damaged it's taken some hits in the fray but it's still standing it's still flapping its wings it now seems to be noticing all the new targets on the battlefield beyond the ones it was-- okay go for it strangely enough that's the name for the battlefield tonight okay hits him you can see the drops of its internal fluids dropping out but it's still standing there that hits the other one (explosion) shoots blasts and you see the lightning arcing across its body lighting up the outside of its normally almost nightmare-black flesh the smoke dissipates and you can see blood dripping from its form black and disappearing into the sky beneath you the wind from the cyclone whipping it out of sight still flying in space though they're both heavily wounded but they're still there scanlan you're up you don't know what would happen the range on fireball it's a pretty long range i'm pretty sure fireball 150 feet yeah you could totally hit him with it you're still prone on the ground by the way okay you still have about 15 ten feet of movement vex is behind you percy's to the front and the right of you pike's above you might be yeah any of them would including grog and keyleth actually no because he's up here he's out of range i'm sorry my bad i forgot he's right there i'm like this will be enough platforms how can that possibly not be enough platforms lesson learned five of your seven fireball charges puts it at a level what okay so 7th-level fireball dexterity saving throw from him that is a 21 so roll damage and he takes half 40 okay so he takes 20 points of fire damage okay all righty pike you're up yeah actually you're not that far from it if you move over to here about this space you could probably get within 60 feet of everybody yeah vecna is going to use his reaction blowing a let's see all right so what's the spell level on that 9th-level spell all right so it's a dc of 19 he has to roll an ability check using your spellcasting ability which is ten so-- you're too far away from him that's true so 17 natural 17 plus ten so 27 (sighs) seven plus ten that's 17 it's a 9th-level spell he needed to roll a 19 or higher so he fails-- (cheering) well that was-- your hex was gone and you said intelligence on that one too okay because you called hex sure because you attacked physically in melee you're right in his face oh yeah i'll say so she gets to divvy up the hit points however she wants (laughter) everybody all right so everybody's at full hit points all right so that finishes your turn pike okay so you'll get down you can move about that far so that ends pike's turn top of the round we're back to vecna who gets his legendary actions back you would be able you could fly up closer to vecna or fly lower because you moved with a fly speed of 20-- okay so vecna's turn frustrated and angry as his counterspell fizzles out of his hand very well first and foremost no friends he's going to go ahead and cast a high-level hold monster no it lasts for an hour fail and fail i need both kashaw and zahra to make wisdom saving throws please all of them 22 the wyvern wings immediately lock in place as both of you feel your entire bodies slowly seize up you with the wyverns plummet out of view no you do not you guys plummet out of sight what reaction would you like to do hellish rebuke you'd have to take let's see here for hellish rebuke you have to be hit first and then you return but the hold spell prevents you from actually taking any actions or reactions hold monster it's a type of-- here it's a creature you can see hold person is designated for just people hold monster's a better version which can affect pretty much anything both he cast it at a very high level no you both quietly fall off the wyvern as you plummet in silence past the edge plummeting down the side of the tower you get an attack of opportunity you already used sneak attack before the end of your last turn you're right his wisdom is 22 that's his wisdom score his wisdom saving throw is that what you want to know it's a plus ten so whatever he rolls plus ten you're a little higher there vax go for it so what's the total on that one the damage you just did you watch as some of his wounds begin to seal up looking at him you get a sense that he heals roughly we'll say for the sake of this because it's the end of the game why not heals 50 hit points a round you guys have been doing some good damage to him yeah you dodged away from him all right so that brings us to grog nope i gave him a strength save to see if he managed to push the sword away natural 20 so the sword dislodges as he yanks it out of his side it dangles the chain and you pull it back up from him you are about i'd say 40-50 feet you were here so you're about yeah 50-60 feet from him that way all right so you're holding your action okay that brings us to end of your turn he's going to go ahead and use two legendary actions to cast telekinesis with an extended range yes but he has an extended range on all of his spells because of his-- yeah for most of his spells not all of them so he looks down and begins to rise his hand up you watch as the central column begins to shift lift up higher and higher until about midway there going to adjust this a little bit so we can-- natural 20 they are currently now plummeting off the side you watched them disappear from sight as he goes ahead and lifts that up it shifts up into the space we'll say pike is about there all right and that is his spell so that ends grog's turn vex you're up go for it he can see you you don't get sneak attack nope he's currently floating up here right now it fires off to the side the nerves kicking in to you unfortunately it doesn't strike true that hits 16 points of damage all righty got it all right does that end your turn all right so you shift over to the side go ahead and place yourself here floating up there perfect all righty is that your turn all right that's it at the end of your turn he's going to use two more legendary actions as he's off on the other side and he's been lifting this large rock up into the air it slips up higher and higher into the center space he's carefully guiding it to position as he holds it there he glances about well it seems i assume that many of your tanks are now empty i hate to be repetitive but i'm extremely frustrated with how hard it is to kill you as he brings his hand other hand up in the air you hear an even louder tear as a third time the sky opens up this time sending a meteor that side this side and crashing into the side here to impact and explode in a 40-foot radius up in the air above that's his third and final 9th-level spell dex save for everybody the platform is destroyed from the impact by the way so that central column is now missing yep he pulled it right up beneath you and one of the meteors slammed into so scanlan all right so that is 72 points of bludgeoning damage right so half of that 36 technically half of 72 no damage to you then half damage to you so take 36 you take full percy you take the full then 65 points of fire damage so 32 yeah the total would be 72 and 65 that would be 137 so you only take 32 points of fire damage yeah he had other spells at his disposal but you guys kept fucking healing all right so that ends vex's turn vax you're up you're probably a little bit closer 69 points of damage all righty all right so with that you appear directly into vecna's face the blade still clasped in your hand almost where you appear next to it it's jammed right into the clavicle area and as it broke through you can see the glowing energy within the ribcage flashes bright with anger as the eye bursts forth where once it was this crackling arcane energy there's now a visible giant green flame billowing out like an angry fire (flames crackling) hits 20 points of damage will be the final attack all right that ends your turn all right so who's at low hit points well here how many hit points do you have vecna can see through your physical forms 36 all righty all right he's going to use his third or sorry his final legendary action for this round to cast firebolt at you scanlan at this moment no that is an eight plus 16 that is a 24 to hit all right you suffer 23 points of fire damage all righty so at the end of vax's turn that brings us to the 20 initiative count at this point in time-- j'mon is smashing into the sides of the forcecage and looking around at the rest of you guys unable to escape not all dragons are spellcasters all right so five skeletons rise up from the ground so first attack natural two that misses second one natural four that's 11 third attack natural two luck is working in your favor so far fourth attack that's going to be a 19 six points of slashing damage final attack is six plus seven that's 13 what's your ac oh shit so these skeletons are swarming you hacking and swinging away trying their best to finish you off and you barely dodge through some of them-- at this point in time you glance over and see a fist grab the rock side of one of these platforms-- you watch as a second gauntleted fist hits the side and climbing up over the edge of one of these platforms you see immediately the red-scaled face and horned body of a heavily-wounded but still-living arkhan making his way up onto the platform (cheering) you watch as one of the hands removes itself from the building and you can see this translucent set of chromatic wings that are drifting off of the giant armored dragonborn's shoulders what do you want to do it took most of your flight to get to this point you have another action though well you have an action and a bonus action he hasn't arrived yet there are still two gloomstalkers also that are about to take their turn yes but you've used your movement you'd have to use your action to dash he's unfortunately more than 60 feet away from you yeah you can get to about this point with a full 60 movement at a glance close to 80 feet okay so dash action using these chromatic wings granted by the flight potion and the dramatic effect of tiamat's blessing you manage to glide up next to pike both of you with your very opposite visual of god-granted wings side to side you see pike with singe marks on her face her hair tousled the bludgeoning causing blood to pour from the side of her ears and the corner of her mouth you look over at arkhan next to you part of his flesh has been necrotically burned away and you can see heavy wounds it looks like he's sustained a bit of a heavy fray with the death knight but he's not being followed at the moment as a bonus action okay yeah 20 to hit unfortunately it hits the front of vecna's body and you watch as the javelin splinters apart into a hundred different pieces of wood and metal both of these guys arc upward gloomstalkers this guy here is going to shriek he gives out this horrible sound as it swings out i need wisdom saving throws from both scanlan-- this isn't a fear-based thing it is magic okay wait you have freedom of action cast on you right it's a paralyzation effect it has no effect nope so this one however is going to land and is going to try make an assault on you percival that's going to be 28 to hit you suffer 17 points of piercing damage and seven necrotic 24 total it's going to also claw you and that's a 21 to hit take 13 points of slashing damage all righty that is going to bring us to keyleth so you fly up from this point got to pull you up a bit okay so you fly up grog what are you doing at this point okay you'll be falling if she drops you roll an athletics check yeah totally 23 rolled a 16 plus five that's a 21 so you succeed well i mean grappled is not going to stop him-- no he's not immune to grapple but it does not stop his movement because of his size but you're attached to him so currently at the moment you are locked into vecna's current little-- i'll put you there it's just crazy 64 with a one-handed strike right just a d8 it's the brutal critical right well it's only two dice technically because you took levels in fighter that was my fault last time 81 points of damage none of them it's all slashing sword of kas kill fucking vecna as keyletar lifts and thrusts you upward you reach out and as vecna tries to dodge out of the way you manage to grab onto the side of the ribcage as you're clutching on the side of it and by the way the rib itself is this wide around your hand although with your titan form your fingers barely close around it you swing and dangle and as you do you take the blade and jam it right up into where the force of the greenish energy in the chest where the ribcage is and as you strike it there's a burst of energy out from inside out of him and vecna screams as the sword at the back of your mind goes yes you guys watch at this point to those who are close by the red glow of the coal-like glow in grog's eyes the vampiric eyes are flaring now as the anger of the sword is now synchronizing with his hatred as you jam it inside the burst pushes the blade out but now you can see another little sparkle of light within the inside of that pulsing glow in his chest you can see now three distinct currently available weaknesses in his avatar form however he will continue to heal and if he heals those begin to close so yes go for it 22 just misses his ac is 23 all right so go and roll your damage on that 28 plus 15 ooh 43 points of damage so as you strike with the first swing of the greatsword as it strikes across it hits the side of the armor and bones and cleaves off no impact but you use that momentum to swing it around and jam it up towards one of the open wounds right where the blast in the shoulder was that percy left earlier and was then opened by the rest of the party as you jam it inside you can feel the heat of the bursting arcane energy from the inside of his body his avatar form fighting with every bit of impact and the proximity's almost beginning to hurt your face but as you can see a pretty decent wound that's true you can roll that for me other than those openings on his body doesn't look too bad but he looks pretty rough to begin with because he's a lich it's hard to tell all righty that ends keyleth's turn percival you're up that hits go and roll damage okay as you swing the sword around you see it bite at you and you take your hand using diplomacy as a gauntlet to protect you you grab the side of its face and push the snapping jaws to the side and using that opening you take the blade and slip it up into its throat and it immediately collapses you duck out of the way as its body falls lifeless to the ground the second one has suffered enough damage to be picked off and part of its jaw gets blasted off and it melts into that liquid black smoke-like disappearing ether okay so you're moving down this way this way okay yeah you can move over here that's 20 feet and you can fire and hit three of these skeletons in one shot roll damage that's just enough to take them out the first one is destroyed and the damage is maintained roll for the hit on the next two i know final roll this guy's also in the line they all three from one shot it goes through their various spinal columns causing them to shatter across the stone and slide off the side all right so as you're doing this percival scanlan you glance down and can see into the city of vasselheim at this point large columns of smoke are spilling up from the city you can see at various temples there appear to be various clusters of divine energies beginning to emit it looks like there are clerical groups that are in the process of trying to conjure or find ways to protect the city but at that moment you can see a dozen or so angelic entities that have been summoned by one of these temples swarming in as about 25 gloomstalkers swipe in and they begin to harry each other at that moment you watch as a giant arm of the titan swings upward and annihilates pretty much all of them in one swing gloomstalkers and devas alike all smashed and scattered in one swipe of the arm as another one immediately with the momentum slams down into the city of vasselheim and the whole area below begins to shake though you guys are currently tethered by these platforms you don't feel the impact but you see the city around and hear the empty echoing impact of that fist on the ground yes all right that ends percy's turn scanlan you're up yep she's just in range she's 55 feet from you 8d4 plus eight 25 plus eight so 33 that's your bonus yes you were what action are you holding (laughter) okay all righty pike it's your turn let me find out real fast here mass cure wounds up to six creatures within a 30-foot radius sphere within 60 feet so you could cast the sphere-- it's a 30-foot radius sphere so you could get yourself arkhan percival and scanlan in it if you wanted to 3d8 plus her wisdom modifier plus ten yeah she rolls sorry 40 points to all of you guys i disagree sir sure that ends pike's turn that brings us back to the top of the round which is vecna's turn gets his legendary actions back all right actually i need you to make a concentration check how much damage did you take from meteor swarm so a 32 we'll say is the dc it's a constitution saving throw your hunter's mark is gone thank you for the reminder vecna who is clustered in this space seeing the sphere appear down below and realizing the issue of the immediate vicinity is going to cast a 6th-level circle of death right in the space where he's at it isn't a concentration check i need a constitution saving throw from keyleth vax and grog it's a spell yes it's constitution so you would not have advantage technically right 23 does not succeed gotcha so that's half damage that will be 10d6 that's going to be 41 points of necrotic damage reduced to 20 to all three of you because you saved that ends your reaction all righty you used your reaction doesn't want to take another sneak attack from you he's going to stay because you guys moved too close right now he's going to stay right there he's right now grinning you can see the flame bursting out of his left socket the hand pulsing with power end of vecna's turn you're up no he just needs to break the grapple that's a valid point actually i should have remembered that and i'll do this as the current circumstance because he does have the hand returned to him each of you should have taken 2d8 cold damage for each hit i forgot to mark that on the sheet that's nine points of cold damage to you keyleth we'll put you at 11 points of cold damage nine points of cold damage and another ten points of cold damage for you and then grog since this is the first time you've hit him in melee that's been twice so that's ten points of cold damage reduced to five and five reduced to two every single time you melee hit him you take 2d8 cold damage that was my fault for not remembering that yep in melee you have the wound there you have the inside of the green energy force there and then you have one on the side of the head you could probably climb up a bit and go for it because you're pretty big roll a strength check you have advantage because you're raging yeah 20 is the dc for applying a trammel on a strength check it's not athletics it's whatever your strength modifier is as you climb up you pull out the trammel he had the raven queen who has ioun's trammel ioun didn't have a trammel sarenrae never gave one it was ioun yeah so pike has ioun as you climb up you take the trammel its large spiraling platinum form shout and jam it as hard as you can into the opening on the side of the head as he turns to look at you the flame burning the trammel pierces into the side of vecna's massive skull and temple as it buries in you can feel the flames from the impact burning around your fingers as if the very surface of the sun is threatening to burn your hand off the pain is extreme but you push through it and as you jam it you can feel it spiraling in and you turn it and twist as it digs in vecna (roars) gives out this horrible screaming yell and as it pulls in you watch as the very end of it seems to glow with this bright yellowish sun-like light it's locked into place that's your action 28 to hit all righty all righty okay go for it two more attacks 33 hits jesus christ 61 as the sword is cleaving into the side as you're holding the trammel now for support jamming at it you can hear the laughter in the back of your head how does it feel i will usurp you i will take you i will be you that ends your turn all right at the end of grog's turn he's going to use two legendary actions here what's everyone's hit points right now keyleth what's your hit points grog pike okay let's see here yeah let's do finger of death why not it's going to be at vex that's going to be a constitution saving throw if you don't mind bless is concentration correct make a constitution saving throw to see if you maintained it okay so i'll let you do that what did you roll 23 that does not succeed unfortunately you take 64 points of necrotic damage you are 32 points of damage all right vex it's your turn yeah that hits roll damage vax you're up next that's your first arrow okay make a perception check you can move 50 feet on the broom so you can get about here you won't be able to get all the way over you can try you can coast to about here okay that ends your turn vex all righty let's see here he's going to spend two points to cast another spell j'mon is trying to find a way or hoping for an exit from here he's going to cast disintegrate down onto your orb scanlan except for disintegrate the sphere dissipates around scanlan disintegrate was a 6th-level that brings us to vax you had the sword out right now in the other hand i'll let you do that as a hasted action you did see it was a fair amount of strength it entailed to apply all righty at the end of your turn he's going to use his fifth and final legendary action to cast firebolt at scanlan again that is a 34 22 points of fire damage vax is that the end of your turn that brings us to the 20th count the stones are going to shift the tendrils are still holding them in place as they're slowly rotating and shifting around the battlefield skeletons are going to both attack you scanlan that is a 14 so you take seven points of slashing damage and that is a natural 19 so you take another seven points of slashing damage 14 total all righty arkhan your turn okay 23 just hits you guys are keeping these other wounds from sealing up yes oh for the critical the dice would as well brings it back down to five he is resistant to necrotic damage so each of these necrotic hits are doing less damage nevertheless it's still 55 points of damage in one crit hit which is awesome right the rest of it went through fine 29 hits roll damage keyleth you're up next by the way 43 first hit was 37 not a bad round a little bit of reduction because of the necrotic but still pretty fucking nasty ending arkhan's turn that brings us to keyleth which one you have the shoulder or the inside of the belly okay five because it was resisted you only did five damage you pull the trammel out this is the somewhat-damaged this spiral-crafted spike the trammel of the raven queen your wings unfurl and you arc over back to the shoulder where you had already dug your blade in you can see the bursts of green arcane energy and life force of the avatar form bursting outwards you pull back with the trammel roll your strength check this is an ability check what was it unfortunately as you reach back and attempt to jam it into the space vecna's body shifts just out of place and as the trammel smacks into the shoulder and armor you hear this terrible shattering sound as the trammel-- it breaks in your hand you're one trammel down i'm so sorry taliesin and that's how the dice roll it's all good bonus action or movement okay then that's the end of keyleth's turn percy you're up that hits roll damage and then roll for the second one all right he is disintegrated and then roll for the second one 18 you can't misfire on the others it still hits both are destroyed as you're starting to figure out here what the damage pressure does is it reduces the dc required to apply the trammel meaning the damage you guys put on prevents the trammel dc from climbing up correct go for it 19 gun is reloaded that finishes percival's turn scanlan you're up it's going to carry you up there you go it's too late now what are you doing how do you inspire him take your d12 for that man all right scanlan that end your turn all right that brings us to pike your turn you are about 55 60 feet from him not with your fly speed of 40 no you can get to him but it'll be both your move and action this turn we'll say for you pike you're about ten feet below grog keep that in mind oh a double dash oh then you're right there never mind so you are good there you go all righty so that's your turn pike you have movement movement and you have a bonus if you wanted to do something not as a bonus action no okay all right that end your turn pike all right end of the round vecna gets his legendary actions back grog haste fades from you as the spell fades you feel your muscles lock up and your entire body is currently stunned for the next round that's what happens when the haste spell ends so as you're clutching your muscles lock up and you're still holding onto the trammel but your entire body is locked up as exhaustion takes over and you're basically having to hold yourself there in place vecna is going to cast with his last 7th-level spell a 7th-level banishment spell i would like both pike and grog to make charisma saving throws please oh well done so as the banishment spell fizzles in place-- vecna glares right in your direction all right no words just seething hatred in your path that's going to end vecna's turn grog you're up your stun fades but that's your turn what's up yeah he loses his whole turn at the end of grog's turn he'll use two legendary actions he's going to cast through the hand of vecna-- he's starting to run low on high-level spell slots you guys have been running him ragged he's going to cast finger of death at you scanlan scanlan i need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw that's a success you take half damage so you take 49 points of necrotic damage half of it that'll be 24 points of damage how much health are you at right now holy shit goddamn it i'm both frustrated and proud all right well that ends grog's turn with that vex you're up 8d4 plus eight yeah i would say it goes through the full round it would be at the next round i'd say yes greater restoration i don't think lesser gets rid of stun unfortunately i'll allow it and that's the end of your turn to get up there you can move five more feet we'll say right there i'll put you right there you're right over the edge okay all right scanlan i would like you to-- here it is i'd like you to make a wisdom saving throw please 15 scanlan in the grasp of bigby's hand you suddenly become a tiny little fox you maintain concentration correct he polymorphs you into a fox no that's the end of that all right that was the end of vex's turn vax you're up polymorph an unwilling creature must make a wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect okay i'll double-check wisdom saving throw so anyway what are you doing all right so we'll say you were there you were there there we go i see it there we go fixed we'll say six hit points so a total of how much damage was it so you take two damage all righty all right at the end of vax's turn-- he is going to cast a fifth-level banishment so i need a charisma saving throw on grog and scanlan both scanlan and grog (poof) from existence bigby's hand remains because concentration is maintained-- oh god look at that hopefully it hasn't dried up there you go (laughs) it's not enough unfortunately and mage slayer is a reaction they both vanish from the space all right yes he did 22 was the total from that one all right that brings us back to the 20 at which point the dark energy emanates once more removing any sort of necrotic resistance from anybody within the vicinity arkhan 31 hits 30 points of damage all righty that's going to be a 21 so he succeeds on the first hit 27 hits 30 points of damage again making his save that's ten plus seven that's 17 so yes because the dc is 15 for the damage he takes so he succeeds that's a two two and a three yeah (cheering) okay arkhan end of your turn all right that brings us to keyleth well no wonder it's not coming out (laughs) you chewed the end closed yeah the shield came off all righty that brings us to percy what's that no it's attached to his body it's attached to his body you can't shoot his hand off scanlan your turn all right what are you holding all right so pike take your inspiration die what do you say to pike all righty pike it's your turn i'd say handing it over point-to-point i'll allow it to be part of an action because he's right next to you and he's capable now okay roll 2d10 roll the first one tell me what you get okay that's not a success unfortunately i know sorry sarenrae's influence cannot break past this barrier right now with your proximity to vecna the sheer force of his current presence is too strong (laughs) unfortunately no he's going to attempt to fire bolt-- going to fire bolt you vax that's going to be a 21 to hit well it's not until the very end of the round now it's the end of the round you have control of yourself back we're back at the top of the round which is vecna strangely no oh this will be interesting trust me i know vecna is going to through the hand of vecna begin to attempt to teleport because you held action so yes you would are you going to try to counterspell okay what level well that definitely works (laughs) okay then go for it sure try for it you have disadvantage on the attack though yeah that hits hand stays on him yeah that ends vecna's turn he seems extremely frustrated okay (gunshots) everyone's swarming up around him and each time he tries to cast a spell even in his current divine form he's growing more and more frustrated you can see now as this hulking entity is still bursting into vasselheim and destroying you can see a moment of panic in a fresh god's eyes ends vecna's turn grog you're up go ahead and make a strength check grog that's actually not what i did but you can think what you want all right so what's the grand total on that 33 as you take the trammel grabbing the bottom of the ribcage curving it underneath you thrust it up into the core center it seems of his chest where the avatar arcane energy is amassed and as the trammel squeezes in you hear the guttural rage from the inside of vecna screaming you dare and as he inhales the force of the voice is pulled back into a moment of weakness and once again you can see the fear flickering in the eyes the burning rage of the green flame begins to diminish ever so slightly as the second trammel is applied you don't have a hasted attack it faded as you're cutting through the body you see bits of vecna's avatar form tattering and falling apart i would like you to make an intelligence check you were told and knew that you could not kill a god a god that ascended from a lich form generally has the capability if the body is destroyed to reform elsewhere you begin to get the sense that at a certain point if you end up destroying this avatar form it might ruin everything grog that ends your turn vex you're up you get roughly to the edge here with your 50 movement i'll say you can land sure i'll allow it okay that ends your turn vax you're up okay so make an acrobatics or athletics check actually for grapple it may just be athletics let me double-check here it's an athletics check so roll athletics 19 plus five 24 grapple fails all right that brings us to the 20 the buildings shift back once more across the ground these begin to rotate and spread outward this way that one merely stays where it is at this point in time arkhan okay this would be on a grapple that's athletics check okay and that was a 19 so you are currently grappling the hand that's an attack to grapple it's on there pretty tight it's not just a hand you can cut off it's an artifact it's returned to its original owner no it's an action spent your turn yeah not at this size and the fact that you're flying there he's too big that brings us to keyleth make an athletics check the current avatar form looks like it's-- it's pretty bad so you now have arkhan grappling a hand you have grog grappling the side of the torso keyleth you turn over and grapple part of the body you guys are basically holding vecna at bay at the moment is that your turn keyleth scanlan it's your turn all right he's going to make his wisdom saving throw with a dc 20 because of two trammels that is a 17 he's going to use his last legendary resistance to succeed the text goes blurred to you on the book so you cannot read it for a full round somebody else could it's still glowing the text is glowing for an hour once you've put the spell slot into it the text becomes visible correct is anybody else here trained in arcana you do i don't know pike are you trained in arcana do you have proficiency in arcana this text is far too illegible for somebody who isn't trained in arcana planetars can read all languages you can certainly try so at the end of scanlan's turn-- at the end of scanlan's turn-- okay how do you inspire her take your d12 inspiration die okay end of scanlan's turn going to use two legendary actions to attempt to cast dominate person well not both arms are currently grappled to the point where the arms can't move he's also a very big guy grappling is more of holding onto him and preventing him from moving but he can still move it's a hard thing it's a little wishy-washy at this size all right so scanlan i need you to make a wisdom saving throw at what level okay go ahead and roll (shouting) so now it's pike's turn pike your turn yeah you're actually right up there with keyleth what are you doing okay okay all right that finish your turn pike all right you can move if you want okay that's easy enough you guys are all clustered around him okay that ends pike's turn end of your turn he's going to use two more legendary actions to attempt to cast 4th-level banishment on scanlan he's running through what things he can all right make a charisma saving throw please top of the round vecna's turn legendary actions are returned at this point now the titan has waded into the center of vasselheim each progressive round it's been this one footstep after the other you can hear screams and yells but you also see the divine temples in the distance are beginning to summon various bits of divine energy from those in the clerics that reside within the city you can see a storm has now merged with the darkness that vecna has spread over the city and lightning bolts are beginning to be brought down in a familiar crack that you heard when you were battling groon as you can see now the acolytes of the recently fallen trial forge are bringing their rage down upon the exterior of this entire swarm of gloomstalkers and the titan vecna is going to try again he's going to cast another banishment on scanlan would you just be rid of me finally go die make another charisma saving throw well not for a saving throw he can't what did you roll scanlan with the book vanishes from sight at this point vecna who's being held by all (chuckles) come on show me what you're worth at this point you watch as one of the titan's arms is now rising up over the tower you get the sense he's getting really desperate go for it grog as vecna's lifting his right hand up even in the grasp you can see the titan's arm rising up like it's being puppeteered by vecna as it puts another shadow down upon the top of entropis this large multi-hundred-foot-wide ram of sheer rock all right total damage is 11 okay he does 12 and 12 plus seven each so yeah he succeeds that's the end of vecna's turn who's locked in place now it's your turn grog he did he healed 50 hit points in the last turn okay so he has to make a dc at half that which is going to be dc of 24 well no not on this oh any time with mage slayer oh that's right 18 to a natural one (shouting) yeah i know and with that scanlan appears back in place oh shit okay that's the end of grog's turn vex okay that's your turn go for it okay are you going to move as well just enough movement to come over and hold percy's hand okay as you guys stand there looking up hand in hand glaring as scanlan reappears in place and with the shadow now looming over entropis in a long line across the city of thar amphala as this massive titan arm is rising up that's going to end that vax what are you doing all right that is a 24 i don't believe you've kissed her in her keytar form so it's a new experience for you the tape is wearing off it's worked well enough for most of it vecna's going to take attack of opportunity on you as you rush by you're swung along as he strikes (screams) swing in place that's going to be a ten there we go 27 okay all right that is 24 points of cold damage and you're immune to paralysis so it doesn't do anything else all right arkhan just an action okay keyleth it's your turn you probably have to take the tome from him to read it scanlan's being held up by bigby's hand in the center black-winged angel of fate and death on one side the white-winged planetar of keyleth representing life on the other you take the book from scanlan you spend your action to try and read it laura and which you can because your planetar form-- you just read it it's his saving throw he saves you just read it you begin to recite from the text like scanlan did as the mysterious words begin to emit from the-- let me take a quick picture of this as you read from the book page after page the words come out something you don't seem to understand in your mind but the form understands and as it does the runes glow you look up as the trammels begin to glow one two you hear this sucking sound how do you guys want to do this (shouting) describe your support of this you guys are holding vecna back how do you prepare for this as he's currently being held by these trammels in place as you guys are there clutching him in this form you watch as suddenly the dark clouds above begin to part directly above the tower as the titan arm is lifted up and beginning to make its way down in your direction as the shadow strengthens the trammels (explosion) in the side of the head no too long too long (agonized yell) as they suddenly vibrantly brighten you watch as the lattice of the divine gate begins to spread out around his body the energy begin to consume his form and within one bright fiery sun explosion-like flash and a sound like a deafening thunderclap not feet from where your body is all of you are thrown from the detonation as vecna claps out of existence you all begin to fall as the entirety of the field dissipates around thar amphala the first sunlight probably ever to really touch the city hits as you watch waves of gloomstalkers dissipate as the cloud slowly pulls away the large titan arm grinds to a halt from above as its entire undead body halts locked in place the magic that maintained it no longer of this plane you fall there is a platform not too far from you i would like those who were clasping on to vecna to make a strength saving throw to try and capture yourself on the edge you're flying you're fine unfortunately the force cage is still in place it lasts for an hour 22 okay okay you both manage to barely catch on to the edge the strain is immense and you both still manage to suffer 23 points of general strain damage technically it's the fall damage but you caught yourself you barely pull yourself back up onto these platforms the tethers still remain holding it but you don't know how long it'll be there as the energy is subsiding around this tower you all take a moment to imagine what you've lost what you've gained everything has led to this moment and in the quiet and the stillness you hear a new sound it's thousands and thousands of distant voices cheering from the city of vasselheim below of wyvern and eagle riders above you but a small example of the hundreds of thousands of lives you may have saved anyone else do anything the hand did come off actually the body vanished but the hand the artifact still remains behind (laughing) you guys watch as arkhan-- without even the mental strength the emotional strength to take in the ramifications of what just transpired you all look to each other in this moment of victory a year's journey and you breathe a sigh of relief true relief and that's where we're going to end tonight's game we'll pick up on this next week holy shit you guys you are the luckiest motherfucker i swear to god all of you guys okay well on that note those of you who are still with us thank you for being so patient i hope so i know it's been long we're at 1240 but what a way to finish a final boss man as a note he had ten hit points left (gasping) and his ability discorporation when vecna drops to zero hit points his avatar form is destroyed but his essence travels back to his phylactery demiplane just beyond the prime material and he is unable to take physical form for a time yeah this would have gone into a few more sessions and he would have come back with far more knowledge and far more preparation before he's up against you guys i'm glad that worked out (applause) love you guys shut up it's 330 430 thank you blindspot for releasing her early enough to come play with us tonight thank you guys for watching we'll pick this up next week until then rest well we love you and is it thursday yet
