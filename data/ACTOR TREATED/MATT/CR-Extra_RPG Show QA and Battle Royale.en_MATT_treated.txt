hello everyone and welcome to tonight's pseudo-episode of critical role where a bunch of us nerdy voice actors will be answering your questions and then doing a fantastic battle royale showdown between pike vax keyleth and percy for those of you who were here for our last battle royale it's going to be a fun circumstance where the players are dropped into a scenario they do not yet know they'll be forced to battle with only one victor the last man standing but we'll get into that for the second half of this evening first let's get through some quick announcements if we want to get through those i probably should have loaded them up on my phone you want to get to that right now but in the meantime this comes to our fourth and final week of this run being sponsored by loot crate who've been fantastic for this month run of critical role it's our first time trying out a sponsorship you guys have been awesome in checking out their stuff and i hope a lot of you guys have enjoyed becoming part of the loot crate membership family we are yeah at wwwlootcratecom/criticalrole i talk for a living anyway what else do we want to announce this evening grog i thought it was i should probably turn mine in too i do have to point out strong appreciation for taliesin to really fly the true nerd banner by having a trip to hawaii and spending a portion of it in his hotel room playing d&d on skype that's pretty great love the bees at a distance what other announcements have we got i have a quick announcement those who haven't seen or had an opportunity to play yet this week had the launch of overwatch blizzard's new game i'm lucky enough to play the character mccree the space cowboy you guys get to have an opportunity to shoot a six-shooter in the game and tell people (mccree voice) it's high noon if you haven't played it you should it's a lot of fun i have enjoyed the crap out of it i get tweeted pretty much at every time zone's noon every day people barrage me with hey matt what time is it no apparently any gun-slinging guys with mccree in their name have been me this past year space cowboy that's abe (abe voice) abraham presley yeah guys in hats with guns has been a theme this past year some of them with really great facial hair i love that theme we're going to have to sync up and play it anyway we've got questions to get to so first and foremost we have a few sources of questions obviously we're not going to get to a lot of them tonight because there's a lot of questions but there's a reddit thread that's been up for a little while we're going to be pulling questions from there the chat room as well we have at our side here we have questions coming from you guys there as long as we can keep track of it because it goes pretty fast is my mic bad not getting a good mic i'll lean this way then and try and get to this section should work fine yeah but the camera is there karen just being picky guys stop being picky it's all good so long as you guys can hear me i think we're okay yeah we have reddit we have the chat room and then we have on twitter the hashtag critical role questions as well we'll be going through those and picking questions answering them as they come so let us begin we're apologizing now for all of us looking at our phones it's not because we're bored it's because we want to answer your questions this comes from groghammer on reddit after the episode 'cows and consequences' matt said it was one of the weirdest but not the weirdest d&d experience he's ever had to him and others with experience what is the weirdest thing that's happened in a game you've played this is an interesting question it could be something in critical role if you want to but if you had other stranger experiences i'll begin this was weird but dark this was when i was running the ravenloft game for a few years with my old group back in the late 2000s as they began to make their way through barovia the atmosphere of it was drawing them down and every night they'd sleep there they would take corruption similarly to how you did when you were in whitestone under the watch of the briarwoods we had our bard begin to grow sharpened teeth we had our rogue character who had a long-dormant mummy rot that had been subsiding in his body begin to spread again we had our blood mage who had died and been resurrected came back not quite right and went a little feral and then we had our paladin whose skin all of a sudden was pulled tighter against his body and as a person whose whole ideal was to fight undead to look in the mirror one day and see that he resembled one he went crazy and started smashing stuff it was a cool buildup but one of the weirder fun experiences was when they had finally finished the battle with strahd when they had defeated him and in theory saved ravenloft the epilogue ended up being a at what cost circumstance well the cleric died in the final battle the paladin killed himself the blood mage disappeared into the forest and was never seen again the rogue who was like the older indiana jones character of the group took the castle for himself and became the new lord of barovia batman-style supposedly to watch over the city but his corruption had gotten so heavy that it wasn't sure if they were replacing one monster with another and the bard who had had a constant feud with the rogue got in the final moments of the game in a huge argument post-battle and the rogue grabbed him and tore his tongue out and the bard now served him as this mute subservient gollum figure and was at the edge of his throne in the epilogue as the rogue took the throne of barovia for himself pretty much it was a hell of an end to that campaign kind of unintentionally that was my friend shaun how about you guys sure this is any game yeah last hit point it was the hobo jack-in-the-boxing and punching a shoggoth any of you guys it was pretty legitimate-- hopefully this will work better for audio thank you so much i hope so like a pamphlet not-quite-sunny barovia if you do find that on the internet please send it to us or find us on twitter i'd love to see that question ashley what classes would the cast of blindspot be in your opinion from zodaru in the chatroom yeah you said so on the show that was my favorite in-joke i've ever seen in television from a nerd point ever those who haven't seen it there's an episode of blindspot where ashley's character gets teased about playing your wizard and elf game and you correct them with-- i'm actually a gnome cleric and i was like yes it is a way to put it liam did you find a question you wanted to tackle here i'll throw one in while you guys are looking question for the players a few of you have come close to trading blows before this is from storybeforenumbers on the reddit page within the actual narrative of critical role do you believe your character could ever be capable of seriously fighting or killing another party member and if so what would it take to reach that point well sarenrae part of her sphere of influence is redemption too with pike i could see her definitely she feels that even somebody's who's fallen that far from what she knew she could find a way to bring them back except tonight there you go we'll have it anyone find any questions they prefer for this one that is now your theme song i'll answer this quick question @mandalore_cauldley on twitter asks what has been the worst or best if funniest way there has been a tpk in any game you've played for those of us who've had that happen before it was the paranoia game that we played on here was pretty fun there was definitely a universal tpk as in we accidentally wiped out all of existence and reality so that was fun i wasn't actually part of this game but i loved the story behind it this was an evil campaign that-- same guy who was the rogue in my ravenloft game shaun-- and a few other people were playing this was 30 d&d and they were an evil campaign they were all evil characters this was in ravenloft the swords & sorcery setting not the expedition to ravenloft the whole plane of ravenloft and his evil cleric had set up for half the game a plot to eventually to kill the rest of the party and take them for power but only the dm knew and eventually he found the right moment right towards the end of their story arc and they were on the cusp of finally completing their adventure and he told the dm this is the moment and he systematically killed each member of the party took their heads preserved their heads still living and put them on the shelf in his now-dark tower and that was the end of the campaign he ended up tpking the rest of his own party and putting them on the shelf shaun's an interesting character actually i think i'm seeing him this weekend at momocon in atlanta see you in a few days shawn (laughter) that can be arranged next time we have a day off like this and people can't make it whoever's around we'll do an evil one-shot that makes me happy chat room let's see yeah i have my own titles when i give the adventure preparation for each session in the actual documents in my folder but then when the episodes happen that very much informs what the episode titles are usually it's-- the titles come out the next monday morning taliesin texting or emailing me at 1130 am and i'll be in the middle of a session like okay bathroom break okay ooh that'll be good and that's all it is that's the thing i'd feel a little weird if somebody i didn't know did the titles like the last episode that came out somebody was like the dragon episode i'd be like hmm i'm not saying that would be the case whoever would possibly do the titles here at geek & sundry but i'm a little attached we can do a vote you do have a father (laughter) we cried so hard when you died that one time well first off no plan survives contact with the enemy this is the general term and also that's what d&d is about there have been many games that i've played where i could do the smart safe move but then i stop myself and go why to me i'd rather try something spectacular and fail spectacularly than keep it safe and on its own and even if a character could possibly die those are the moments that you remember oh the one where he goes and lives the life you two especially have had some interesting changes you changed from pre-stream to stream because of your whole experience on the ship and after death pike has become a lot more hardened and accepting of the harshness of reality and that's been cool to watch that happen yeah it was the second game travis couldn't be there for the second game so i worked it into the story-- i didn't give you exactly what it was but i said if you want to tie it into why travis can't be there with his character how would you want to work these together it evolves in a really strange way dagger dagger dagger don't fuck with her you're right that's your own fault by the way one letter off you dicks real fast i want to put this out there because this question has come up a lot this week yes i'm well aware that dimension door from a rules standpoint says that if you are to teleport to a space occupied by a creature it would shunt you out and take 4d6 psychic damage i think i agree with that however the players came up with a very interesting plan formed two of the smallest possible members into a creature that is so large that i considered in that moment that there would be enough space where you wouldn't be occupying technically the same space as the creature so i allowed it for that circumstance most of the time yes they would be shunted out and if you'd rolled a lower intelligence roll you probably would have been pushed out the side but as a dungeon master you have to justify things consider what makes sense versus what doesn't how much do the mechanics written in the rules rule your game in the narrative and how much you want to allow because the players have been creative or it's an interesting way that could make sense and you can justify i chose in that moment to justify that and it didn't necessarily work in their favor in some ways but that's the nature of making weird cool plans and seeing if they come to fruition or not so i'm well aware and yes i did let it that doesn't mean you have to you can be angry that i didn't follow the rules i thought it was fun and cool teleporting inside a dragon is definitely new the cows and consequences episode in general was ridiculous there have been a few moments well first off everyone going for the treasure at the end of a boss encounter without healing up or checking for traps and that trap that i had set up there just as a possible blockade being enough to knock vex out based on the bad roll i've never had a player death that was directly after the conflict and danger you know what i mean where the calm everything's cool (explosion) it was from a narrative standpoint really cool how it played out but i wasn't expecting that to happen at all it was going to be one other annoyance and warning of the power behind this artifact and it just happened that way that's what i do good no that was pretty cool other moment i would say honestly the showdown with kevdak i wasn't sure if you guys were going to survive that or at least a few of you were going to fall a couple of key rolls in that fight the grog escape the broom escape using the necklace in a way that i never considered it to be used that was-- the way you guys planned that battle worked out almost perfectly to just barely save your asses because that fight was one of the harder encounters i'd ever developed and it was more like i wasn't sure how it was going to go down i had three other maps on the side in case you guys had a sewer journey if you guys wanted to stealth in during the night and assassinate kevdak in his room attempt or find a way to try and-- there were different ways this could have worked the way this all went down i left it open to see what you guys were going to do and this was possibly the hardest way to handle it but it also ended up being one of the most dynamic and cinematic so i was excited how it worked out if anybody had got the death blow aside from grog they wouldn't have stopped that was the sad and scary part because it's one thing having an old member of the herd that challenged him dealing the death blow to give them pause and really consider has this power move shifted is he the new leader that was enough to cause everyone to stop and really consider the situation and with zanror being brought forth and released it put them into this tense period of-- not subservience or respecting or accepting the new rule but not really knowing what to do because their leader was gone and the one who challenged and killed him in a spectacular death and it gave them pause if it was a shitty half-elf that ran up and stabbed their ruler-- from their perspective you guys were shitty half-elves all right and a shitty gnome and a shitty human it would've continued in their mind to be an aggressive act and they would've continued to steamroll you that was so crazy anyway yeah we should answer another question if you guys had not managed to-- the whole mechanic i'd used was if the trap succeeded based on the dragon's perception roll and how well you guys hid things-- had the dragon even noticed there was something different and wrong it wouldn't have landed it would've stayed up there and started spraying you guys down maybe throwing spells it would've been bad considering and you holding it to the ground was important because it prevented it-- because its breath weapon is a line it limited its range and what any powerful dragon does to its advantage is stays in the air and uses-- those few rounds were key once it did get free you saw how fast it could turn in a negative position for a group and the chains were good it sacrificed damage but it also raised the dc of its ability to escape from the grapple that was holding it on the ground you guys did a really good job and had some rolls going in your favor but once it started turning over and it escaped it went south very quick you have him on the run kind of i know it wasn't my intent i had to sleep (laughs) i don't know that's a polarizing term in the community i'm glad and i'm excited that people are passionate enough to be so invested that they are frustrated that things they came up with didn't happen or that they saw circumstances that outside of the game could have worked to me i think those discussions are great there are some people that take it too far and actually make verbal attacks on the players via social media or go out of their way to use those circumstances to really be unfairly dark and necessarily down on us and i'm like those are shitty and those are more of what that's referring to but overall i love the discussion and i think it's great everyone will handle a situation differently and i love people who will have those talks so i don't know if the yourfuniswrong is in a good enough spirit to put on a shirt i do eventually want to do a 'you can certainly try' shirt (laughs) i love it so much all right let's find another question here let's see from geekspiral on reddit for ashley do the blindspot writers work out the critical role references with you or do they sneak it in themselves it's one thing to play a game it's another to play it on the internet where a lot of people can tell you immediately what you did wrong but we're still having fun what do you think is your biggest fault guys that you can say there you go (laughs) to bring it up on you guys like that you vax right and you pike yeah i'm going to do a couple quick twitter questions here rapid-fire so we can get through some of these taliesin did matt tell you about the demon in the gun or when did he (laughs) he knew orthax or he knew that some sort of smoke entity had attached to him and made an offer but you didn't know what bound it to you and it was the weapon yeah it's fun the fact that sam caught up on that and got rid of it was one of my favorite character moments for him because that was going to stick around build a new one i know (laughs) it keeps exploding yeah there's a lot of questions any you want to pick up on chat's working someone asks did sam get experience for destroying the gun yes he did moments like that key moments big story moments like that those are the marks i make those are like the bump-experience bonuses he got a few hash marks for figuring that out and finding a way to make it happen without you murdering him in the process (laughter) yeah it's true question here real fast @matthewmercer do you discuss the night's events in the car ride home or days later together with marisha i guess is what they're referring to yeah on the ride home we'll definitely be like that was crazy and we'll recall events that happened and she'll mention things or ask questions and i'll say i don't know and she'll get angry at me yeah it's also about why chat is so toxic like guys calm down it's okay it's a game calm down about keyleth guys she's having a fun time well the interesting point was we were talking about that it was like why is there this polarizing anger about keyleth out there and i think a lot of it may come from the fact that you are your character by nature is an awkward character who isn't the heroic grandstanding hero isn't the trickster han solo rogue and as that personality type against a banner of other characters who fit more in those realms essentially yeah it's an interesting psychology experiment to think about that from my standpoint i think keyleth's a great character completely unbiased from a dm's standpoint i'm horrified and excited i know that sounds awful but from a narrative standpoint-- i'm never going to force it by any means so if people are like matt killed someone i'm like i'm not going to kill anybody on purpose i'm going to let circumstances work out so far there have been a couple close calls one of these days one of those dice is going to roll lower than that resurrection dc i know hey stakes are escalating guys there's an ancient dragon hey man depending on how this works out some lessons will be learned and hopefully prepare you for the next encounter a little better depending on who's left yeah it's going to be interesting yeah just make sure you pay attention to the lore and the previous experiences you've had with dangerous entities i've told you nothing i just like messing with you guys i'm going to pull up another reddit question here there you go you guys should do that let's see ashley do you prefer as a player to watch things unfold or do you want to be in the driver's seat more also would you ever convert anyone to worshipping sarenrae from jojorious on reddit oh would you ever convert anyone to worshipping sarenrae standing out on a street corner at comic-con question real fast from atlas_adams on reddit saying do the vestiges still draw their power from the deities if so wouldn't they not work for a person who is disloyal i'm not going to go too deep into that i will say that not everyone who was part of the battle and the whole divergence itself was a religious individual many of the artifacts did stem from religious power some of them also from arcane secrets not everything is tied to a specific deity per se also there's two sides to every battle not going to say any more than that my apologies i was looking for another question thinking that was to you my apologies well-- mary had never played before and had not really exhibited interest when we first-- she was invited to the very first session that we were going to run but she couldn't make it she was like i don't know but then hearing all the stories over the years of us playing privately she was like oh this sounds like fun i'm like yeah i already have too many players sorry i know she'd never played an rpg before when we had the opportunity to bring guests on the show it was like oh we have to see if mary can make it and will who i'd worked with on thundercats and a few other projects between he's a huge fantasy buff as you've seen in the previous q&a he loves fantasy but he'd never played an rpg before we had conversations about d&d back when we began our campaign and he kept asking about it and i could see that twinkle in his eye of interest and i was like well we have a guest spot coming up would you be interested in playing he was like i have no idea what i'm doing sure and so we got together at the coral cafe and we built a character went over the rules a bit and he's like i still don't know what i'm doing but sure and he did great and the dynamic's been fantastic and i'm glad they had an opportunity to actually play together when they came back for a couple episodes that was cool good job windows surface windows surface kicks ass we'll get back to you chatroom here in a minute yeah there's for percy this consideration of what your ideas are versus what number one would be functional in the world two how far these designs could you actually produce based on your experience in the engineering realm even things that were available in a historical sense in certain time periods those were people that spent their entire life steeped in these feats of engineering whenever you bring me an idea it would be like trying to marry what you're trying to accomplish versus what would be viable within the game and finding balance as it is but an aspect of your class features what are you talking about i can't imagine it'll ever come up that's pretty great i want to know really bad it's just dickbutts for four pages so many dickbutts lucas real fast we lost the chat room over here on the tablet if you could get that going it was like oh hey guys updating because windows as a hardcore pc user you get used to it i've been using windows 7 for so long and every two days it's like you want windows 10 you sure you don't want windows 10 here's windows 10 all you've got to do is press this button you've just got to press this red button right here you can't really click anywhere else but the button all the buttons install windows 10 thanks guys and i finally was like okay i'll install i'll try this out five minutes later back to windows 7 i'll eventually get there i'm sure cool thank you buddy matt did you plant zahra's flying cloak and vex's flying broom no the flying cloak she purchased with funds that her character had accrued up until that point based on what was established after the dragon fight the first battle she did between the cloak and the dragonslaying arrow are the two things she used all of her funds on that was purely on her end (windows startup noise) i wasn't expecting that to happen i think hardwick's still jokingly bent out of shape about it i've seen him a few times we went to renn faire the week before last and he was like i got to get my broom back man and i'm like yeah have fun with that good luck i know we'll see exactly arcane casters can be tricksy i'm just glad he was able to guest his schedule is so crazy that was a lot of fun yeah that broom was fully on him he brought it and he lost it question from aaronshot on reddit saying matt give us a little tease when you talked about illegal substances being on the market in emon during one of the q&as at a con last year how much world-building have you done to date that we have not seen yet wildemount marquet as much as i can it's a progressive thing i'm developing and have been for years free time has not been copious this show is a fantastic thing every week that takes up a lot of my free time we have a lot of cool things we have coming up that we want to hopefully announce that take a lot of my free time this is one thing that i'm always working on i have fleshed out a good portion of marquet i've fleshed out elements of wildemount it's not as fleshed out as others othanzia and tal'dorei are the two most fleshed out in my world because those are the two where you guys have spent your most time whenever this game's done we start a new campaign it'll probably still be in exandria but it might start in marquet it might start somewhere else in the world and have a whole different cultural flavor and flair and it'll be a whole different side to this world and there'll be references to and history that exists that you would know because you were part of it before but you'll be a whole new group of adventurers in a whole different part of the world that'll be fun you play it carefully you still can whatever that means (nervous chatter and laughter) yeah oh that's pretty great watch it with your kids they'll love it seriously it's great (laughs) it says gilmore started out as kind of a caricature and was a fleshed-out character-- question went away but gilmore didn't start out as a caricature in my head i never want to make an npc a caricature per se there are characters that have strong personality traits and they emerge themselves because for an npc you have to make an impact quickly you don't have a lot of time with them and you want to try and make the world lively and interesting for your players so i have certain personality points that are at the forefront of each personality gilmore to me was never a caricature partially because i built him around somebody i used to do theater with when i was younger in high school so i already had a personality print for him but also i really wanted to show a character that could be ostentatious and flamboyant in a way that was fun and not a caricature if that didn't come across my apologies gilmore is a very charismatic very outgoing salesman and that's part of his job he uses that to his advantage but people have their interpretations i care very much about the character that's his whole thing he's a showman and that's so much of his personality and as you guys got to know him better especially you he let you peek behind the veil a bit and see-- the world-wearied individual there's a lot of depth to the character very much so percival from scarlet pimpernel-ish yes he was he was based off a person in high school that i did theater with i'm not going to say who because he's on facebook (laughter) i will say on that fact too because someone asked this question and they said there have been hints on the characters that have exhibited lgbt relationships in the game but a lot of characters seem to be husband-and-wife-type personalities are those only a small number of people and i'm like no i don't make a big deal of sexuality in the game unless it comes up because i don't think it's something that should drive the story it just exists in the world i think there's relationships of all kinds in exandria and i think culturally just like in the real world some places it's more appropriate than not based on wherever they live it doesn't mean i agree with that by any means i believe love is love no matter where you find it and there are places in exandria where it is more acceptable than others and that's a whole different story element that might come up depending on where you travel in the world i don't know but yeah like many writers i err on the side of creating an interesting character who might happen to be gay or an interesting character that may happen to be bisexual i try not to make that a defining characteristic of the personality nor do i want to try and go out of my way to have a one-off npc that you encounter be like oh by the way i have a wife and i'm a girl because that to me seems like it's forced it's shoehorned and now it's not about the story it's about that relationship whereas if the relationship were to come about as part of the story then that's just how it is because that's life (laughs) how high did you roll on your heterosexual roll when we started your character good on you hey guys this isn't fatal we're not rolling for vaginal circumference (sounds of disgust) all right anyway we got time for a few more questions before we take a break and go into the battle royale for those guys who didn't have your questions answered tonight i apologize we've gotten a lot of questions i'll try and go on the reddit occasionally to answer questions through this thread in the coming months or so off and on and feel free to throw them back at us on twitter afterward we'll answer them as we can oh college of the maestro yeah i put up a college of the maestro bard college on dms guild recently and that came from a character-- i may have mentioned it in previous q&as i've never played a bard but i've always wanted to i love bard classes i love the aspect behind them they were really underappreciated in previous editions but i loved the idea of a guy who knows a little bit about everything and is an inspiration to the party around him and so i had this character concept for a long time to make a bard-- probably a dwarven bard because i love dwarves also-- who as opposed to playing music or singing music could pluck the sound from the air around them the sound of battle the impact of a sword against a shield or the sound of a creature chittering as it attacks and mold it into a symphony almost like a soundbender where they pull and turn it into music and that was their basis so instead of fighting with a weapon they have a wand and an open hand and they stand in the middle or the back of the battlefield and conduct it like an orchestra conductor eventually i got really frustrated and was like i'm going to make this as a bard college and we'll see if people like it it's gotten a good response it's still being tweaked anything homebrew you try and balance it as best you can at first blast i don't have a lot of time to really finetune it and i wanted to get it out there to get the community response and it's been really great you guys have had great feedback and i'm tweaking things as we go so there'll probably be a couple more updates in the next few weeks or months so thank you all people who have reached out and given comments on dms guild or on the reddit thread it's making its way towards hopefully being a fun option for those who want to try it out if you don't like it you don't have to play it oh my god please somebody make a college of the maestro bard that is a deep noise dj (laughter) vegetables of the virgins the vegetable of the virgins that's a dvd set you don't let anyone know you own we've all made that mistake right possibly a lot of this content right now i'm developing as we go and i can't really release too much when we're still playing through it you did good i'm hoping in the future to release elements of exandria or elements of the campaign on dms guild or other means to have you guys play more in what we've done if it interests you or to take and alter as you like but time has to fight itself to me first my suggestion is consider if your character is a murderhobo there are ramifications for that type of action in a society you as a dm it's your responsibility to keep in mind there probably-- unless they're in some sort of destitute place where that's totally fine-- there are going to be guards there are going to be sentinels there are going to be people that their job is to stop murderhobos from coming in and being murderhobos so they will become wanted they will become hunted there's a possibility there might be a bounty put on their heads from individuals that are more powerful than the party and if they're going to be real dicks about it and not try and play the story you've created and want to murder everyone they're probably going to end up shot to death in an alley with a bunch of crossbow bolts and that's the end of their game that's a valuable lesson to learn if it's a world which enables a murderhobo-type circumstance that's different and you can find narratives in there but it's definitely more of an evil campaign and a little harder to run unless you have some experience as a gm but if it's something you don't want to happen in the game keep in mind there are ramifications for such horrible murderous actions which could lead to a really interesting story perhaps they killed a few people and they all of a sudden meet the families of these individuals or the person that captures them is related to someone they murdered and decides no i'm not going to execute you i'm going to make you work for me until you realize what you've done or perhaps a paladin or a cleric that actually feels sorry for them is like you did a horrible thing but i don't understand why you did this i want to understand it until then you're under my watch now they're working for this individual who is trying to understand how you were so corrupted as people you can find different ways to turn that behavior into part of the story but if it's just the players trolling you maybe have a talk with your party to work with you and respect the time you've put into the game then stand up stand up in the story and pull a keyleth and be like guys this is wrong and if they turn around and stab your character to death perhaps this isn't the gaming group you should be hanging with yeah and as a gm or dm before you even start the game have a conversation with all your players to discuss the kind of game you're all looking for be like hey guys this is the kind of game i want to run and it's got some story some intrigue political elements and some combat balanced in some players may be like oh i just want to come in kick down doors kill shit and take loot you want to make sure you all are agreed upon the type of game you want to play so you don't end up four games in before everyone hates each other i will also-- go for it that's pretty great oh we have zoaga on reddit asks quick question for matt as we've seen you've tinkered with the stats of the ancient dragons in the conclave without going into specific details do you have any idea what kind of challenge rating these modifications might put them at i don't i try and measure it but a lot of the measurements are based on parties of four maybe five we have a party of seven sometimes eight people when we have guests on and because of the nature of us coming from pathfinder to this game and i tend to run games a little higher-power than the average i've had to adjust a lot of the difficulty in the game which has been an interesting challenge for me as a dm but also means that the scale is going to continue to get more epic i have to tweak it because we have a lot of powerful characters with powerful items but that's the kind of game i wanted to run anyway the next game might be a little more low-powered depending on where it starts we shall see i've learned a lot remember i came into this -- we went from pathfinder to fifth edition when we started the stream really our first time playing fifth edition so there's been balancing lessons learned as we progress and a lot of circumstances that caught me and the players off-guard as far as difficulty that's part of the fun of the game so for me it's learning through experience previous encounters learning the players' strengths and weaknesses and finding ways to tweak creatures that better fit those to be a real challenge when it has to be and to not be a real challenge when it doesn't have to be not every battle has to be a fight to the death to the teeth ever because sometimes fights are enjoyable for players to show up and fight basilisks that once tore them asunder and be like oh we come back and we tear you down it's fun to have those quick victories sometimes but yeah you have to find it through practice and the dmg scaling does help a lot but on this level this size of a party with what they have at their disposal i kind of have to wing a lot of it what this no there's no experience points for this this is for fun this is just for fun this is for the bragging rights of saying you can beat the shit out of the rest of your own party (laughs) you're welcome someone send him some best dad awards that's horrible that's horrible like snap ooh the reactionary push into the lava's one of my favorites she's like i don't know what to do i'm sorry just pushing him down into the lava as he's like (screaming) i'm sorry that was so funny it was a corrupt treant i can't remember what spell it was but it was something that essentially you can charm a specific plant-based monster and it failed its saving throw it was going to be this epic encounter with this giant corrupted treant in the middle of the bramble forest yeah it was this big old bramble forest that led up to the actual home of the dread emperor and it walked out and was like (roars) and you're like sit down and sleep okay and that was it and i was like well done i like that well we'll find out here shortly let's do one more question and then we're going to take a break and come back here for the battle royale i know i'm trying to see let's go for the chat we've done a lot of these chat let's see what we got this'll be our last question for the night chat is going so fast it's going so fast oh my god this is a quick throwaway it won't be the last one someone asked if i could ever join vox machina what class and race would i be dwarf bard i think i've already specified that a good final end question we'll find out (laughs) we'll find out i know it's going so fast it's okay i'm glad you guys are so excited to ask questions but i can't it's like looking into the abyss i can see through time i don't want to answer that because then it's going to subconsciously make me feel really awful if they die i don't want to answer that i don't want that to happen interesting idea no i don't i don't want that in my head i don't want any of that in my head if it happens it happens the dimensions of the cube (laughs) sam's cube who's the hodor of the group oh we're not going to talk about that also spoilers hodor has an amazing moment hush it's awesome have you ever regretted a decision you made either in character or while dming we'll have this as our final question for the evening that was going to be their turn leave and hit the button as they left circumstance and you went right there and hit it i'm like well that saves them the problem of it it was a great moment but didn't quite work how you thought how about you guys that's okay anything with you guys ross and rachel that's my biggest regret as a dm was saying that right there (laughter) i hope so (laughs) the moment that stops we need to stop doing this which is fine a big part of d&d is fucking up that's just how it is in any good game there's going to be fuck-ups we just roll with it yeah well guys we're going to come back here in a few minutes and do our battle royale we're going to go ahead and get you guys to use the restroom and get ready get your characters-- we've leveled everybody up-- (fierce growls laughter) so let's go ahead and take a break we'll be back here in a few minutes and we'll see which member of vox machina in this battle will stand supreme welcome back everybody we're about to jump here in the battle royale we wanted to let you guys know as part of our final week of the loot crate sponsorship their june theme is dystopia yeah it's dystopia which is cool it's going to feature robocop

criticalrole i was really happy when they printed the pip-boy statue marisha's going to get her dice there you go all right so welcome back as we kick into-- (dramatic music) so suddenly a flash of white takes your vision and as the white fades you see at the end of a long blue sky-like tunnel a man standing dark curly almost permed hair a suit with a white wide polyester lapel white track pants and white shoes he approaches his chest almost visible he speaks with you with confidence the voice of god the voice of everything he goes hello vox machina i am the beyonder (laughter) that's exactly how i think a beyonder would sound if he were to show up in an event so that being the case ladies and gentlemen let's go ahead and roll initiative (groans) you're right there ashley and roll initiative guys all right ashley okay so a total of seven we have 25-20 20-15 all right to see which of you goes first i am going to have you guys both roll off again for initiative 20 again both of you all right so vax is going slightly before keyleth then percy then we have pike all righty so first round is vax's vax what are you going to do you are yes (counting) yes he is within 50 feet yeah this is basic weapons what's your ac percy the damage of it at least let him roll damage first so 39 damage and you want to do your gloves of missile snaring set it aside he basically grabs your dagger out of the air and stops some of the damage before it strikes no it just lowers the damage 26 damage you take piercing damage and i need you to go ahead and make-- is it a constitution saving throw yes it is it succeeds what are you doing vax no you only get to sneak attack once per round correct and remember you have not activated your boots yet okay (laughter) looking at the item real fast too is there an activation cost for the boots oh right we will say for the purposes it would be a bonus action to activate it this whole room is low light it is just the glow from the lava in here since a number of you have darkvision it's not a huge deal within 60 feet but it is considered technically low light right usually it was the first round that you did it but it's fine you can you can reach out and actually change things as you are okay go ahead and roll a stealth check marisha taliesin and all right i need keyleth and percy to roll perception checks okay you guys both-- actually all three of you watch as vax turns behind the corner and vanishes from sight you have no idea where he is you know he is somewhere in this area but that's all you know that is the end of your turn keyleth you're up yeah okay all right so you're firing it this way so what is the-- sunbeam all right percy i need you to go ahead because it is within a 60-foot line a constitution saving throw correct what's your dc so he saves as keyleth you go and you reach your hand out and suddenly the room blasts into bright light as a beam of pure solar energy streaks into percy's face percy you manage to close your eyes and bend out of the way just in time still taking some of the impact you take 19 points of radiant damage you are not blinded because you made your save grasping vine unfortunately is a 4th-level spell you have already cast a 6th-level spell it has to be 2nd or lower i got to pay attention to this stuff otherwise the internet lets me know (laughter) okay barely (laughing) the ceiling actually is about 30 feet up it's a domed cavern you are set into this pocket of very hot earth with no foreseeable exit okay keyleth sinks beneath the ground as you do you suddenly feel yourself plummeting into a pocket of molten rock which is beneath this entire area here okay but you still go ahead and take damage from this we will say here for the purposes of this everyone gets a nice view of the top of my head (counting) 35 points of fire damage from suddenly submerging yourself partially into molten rock and as your rock form does help resist it somewhat it still begins to severely damage your earth elemental form and you immediately pop back up into the space you were in that case happy where you are okay keyleth ends her turn percy you're up you see this giant earth elemental submerge and then come back out of the earth with elements of superheated rock around the edges of its surface pike is off to the side looking about trying to decide what she's going to do but you have the jump on her as a note keyleth by the way because you took fire damage i need you to make a concentration check to maintain your sunbeam half the damage for-- how much did you take from that you rolled a-- 15 plus your constitution-- yeah you're good strength checks are at disadvantage while you're hexed what else you got percy you whip out retort what's your ac for your earth elemental okay so go ahead and roll damage on that it is not magical correct that's seven damage plus four necrotic so a total of 11 points of damage the blasts are hitting the hide of the earth elemental not quite impacting as strongly as you thought okay make a concentration check by the way from the first hit so you have to roll an 11 or higher yeah you're fine (laughter) your ac 17 no this one actually does manage to hit the shoulder but it ricochets off and blasts the volcanic rock near her go for it third shot against the earth elemental keyleth that does hit go ahead and roll damage on this all right so 13 points of damage total i need you to make another concentration check what's your constitution modifier with that sunbeam drops the impact manages to actually knock the spell out of your peripheral 19 so yeah okay that ends percy's turn pike you're up where would you want to place guardian of faith let me see the spell here real fast to make sure i've got this right so guardian of faith there we go it's within 30 feet of you any hostile creature to you that moves to a space within ten feet of the guardian has to succeed-- so where are you putting it right there guardian of faith is 4th-level what level is that one yeah that's fine so shield of faith perfect it's coming so you have a plus two bonus to ac for the duration it's concentration good for you are you going to move or stay right there staying right there in that little corner all right that ends pike's turn top of the round vax you're up technically they didn't see you and from what you're aware nothing has seen you yet so essentially everybody who could see where you are so you'd be giving it away to whoever that individual is do you have your mini by the way i was wondering where it went yep okay yeah he avoids cover his weapons are magic so does not halve 30 points of magical slashing damage against you you right now are completely visible to her you can attempt to hide from her yeah however percy does have sight to you right now you're only obscured from one of them it is dim light actually let me see what the hide circumstance is let me double-check just to be safe hide action in just a minute hide chapter seven for hiding all right let's go to chapter seven then i know it's great isn't it isn't it wonderful i just want to make sure we're doing this properly you are not helping me by telling me it's there this is ridiculous i'm pretty sure you have to be entirely obscured it's not so much having dim light i might be wrong but i don't want them to tell me-- hiding there it is you can't hide from a creature that can see you he can see in dim light it's not darkness he has disadvantage to perception checks because it's dim light he does not have darkvision she can see there she would not be able to see you in this area here behind that wall that's how it would work okay i feel better about that so what are you trying to do 32 you move past here i need percy to make a perception check with disadvantage he vanishes from sight from both of you guys where do you want to go okay cool that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up no it was half the damage you took i'm trying to remember you actually would still have sunbeam still up it was but even then it's half the damage or a ten or higher i was thinking of full damage at the time it's half the damage or ten whichever's higher so you would still have sunbeam i'm sorry i just realized that you are yeah she still saw where you walked need you to roll constitution i believe roll a constitution check pike wait you rolled a three with a plus five con mod i apologize i'm so sorry about this the chat room is really distracting me on this it was a 13 halved but ten whichever's higher ten would have still been the dc you rolled a three with a plus five so you did still lose sunbeam my apologies you guys are helpful sometimes i really need to ignore chat you did lose sunbeam yes half or ten whichever is higher is how concentration works always have to beat a ten no matter what yeah sorry i'm sure it's not the other way that's why i don't have chat on during the game i start second-guessing myself and i realize it's okay you guys are kind of helpful sometimes it's fine taliesin and you are hexed you do not have sunbeam but you are still full earth elemental form it is a portion of the wall in which there is molten rock pooling out of the side yes you get the feeling this whole room has pockets of it that are based around molten rock you can see which ones seem to be closer than others you want to smash that open roll an attack your fist slams into the wall roll double damage because you're siege and this is technically part of a structure roll damage on your slam 2d8 plus five and then double double the whole thing 30 points of damage to the rock wall with one fist your knuckles take out a portion of the wall and molten rock begins to spill into the alley here this whole area right now is spilling molten rock and is now considered an area of lava that is slowly expanding you'd have enough movement i think to do that with your earthglide yeah instead of going around it you just boof through the wall that's fine that ends your turn percy you're up you see the glow of fresh molten rock beginning to spill from around the wall side though you're not sure what the source is pike the heat's causing you to sweat within your armor as soon as you step into that spot-- you wouldn't know you have no idea as soon as you step into that spot what's the saving throw on the guardian that's the dc guardian of faith i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw yes with your feat you take half damage you take ten points of radiant damage mark a 50 for you so keep track of the damage ten points of radiant damage as you stop right there in that spot suddenly you see a glow emerge from the stone pillar and this armored half-golem made of pure radiant energy scoops out and slams you with a fist you manage to pull out of the way just in time but it still slams you in the shoulder almost knocking you off your feet you catch yourself with the rest of your turn you can oh no so retort goes back in the holster as you see percy around the corner pull out from his back unfolds and locks into place 23 points of piercing damage against pike all righty cure wounds at what level 3rd-level what else are you doing in your turn just so you're mindful 3rd-level means you can't cast another spell that's not above 2nd-level just so you know okay cool i know over there all right so you scoot over into this mid-area as the gnome cleric hides between the two boundaries of this rock formation this small hallway there you are and you hear the burbling of slow-moving molten rock behind you all right that ends pike's turn we're back up to the top vax you're up so you move another ranged sneak attack against the earth elemental all right 30 points of piercing damage against your earth elemental form the dagger striking part of your armored self and causing the stone to shatter and break in a section how you at health-wise keyleth you have to keep going wherever you think you need to be of your haste okay okay percy i need you to roll another perception check he can still see past that there's a base-to-base visible you do not have disadvantage though because sunbeam actually does give bright light in the room for a vicinity nope you have no idea yeah yeah you do all right you're there that brings us to keyleth you do drop sunbeam god i'm so confused now i'm so confused you guys have confused me no i know so you still had disadvantage but you would have missed anyway ugh i'm going to just cover the chat now i'm covering it up for my own purposes but yeah no worries it's fine okay go ahead and roll your attack that's fine it's enough to hit the rock go ahead and roll damage 18 damage doubled okay so 18 points of damage your fist slams through the piece of rock there it does open up some of the area and some of the lava begins to spill out but it's just a slow trickle it's not a large deluge go ahead and roll damage all right chat splintering pieces of volcanic rock go shattering through the room skidding across the ground you guys hear the blast as suddenly molten rock begins to spill out from that side now also beginning to illuminate that portion of the floor this whole vicinity is now also covered in lava this one has actually expanded outward to cover that area okay so that's five ten 15 20 25 30 what's your full move on the earth elemental are you then subterranean gliding through based on what you did before because if not your full movement's going to take you to there okay just so you know all right so you're right there cool ends keyleth's turn percy you're up go for it so the first shot is reload second attack is a shot do you have any lucky left don't forget you have your luck points still your feat he did for his level 14 feat for tonight you can't double lucky okay bad news is also broken okay oof all right on which gun cool all right so after the gun echoes back you can see the little bit of dull grey smoke spilling from the barrel which immediately warns you of an impending blast you put the gun down and shake it to get the explosive material out of the side as it just scatters upon the ground and burns naturally you manage to fix it and ready it in time a quick swift action okay right there okay gotcha ends your turn percy pike you're up this way or this way you step out to there you can see percy right across the way you can get pretty close if you want to you can get right there yeah right up next to him all right at what level are you inflicting wounds okay so go ahead and roll a melee spell attack so roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier which i believe is plus 11 28 you see pike run around the corner this glowing beacon of energy and as she goes towards you the radiant divine energy from her holy symbol shrieks into a deep black dark purple as her hand reaches out and grasps at you you try and dodge out of the way but her hand touches you and pain courses through your body you take 4d10 necrotic damage so go ahead and roll 4d10 21 points of necrotic damage as all of a sudden the pain courses through your body and a side of pike you've never seen before all of a sudden frightens you all righty you're just going to stay right there you still have your bonus action you don't have enough movement you just got there with your movement you could he will get a melee attack of opportunity you only have bad news out so it's not really going to-- yeah no so you could if you want to all right you get right back to where you were yeah okay all righty that brings it to vax's turn this is getting interesting haste man you already confirmed the attack yeah you have to roll see what the roll is and then see if you want to reroll it before you go ahead and confirm i believe yeah all right so that being the case i'm going to need-- no you're just out of the way no one seems to see you right where are you moving to okay let me see yeah okay all righty got it okay all right that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up at the start of your turn keyleth the lava has now spread out into this way and has created a complete bridge there that is beginning to spread it will probably by next turn-- so what are you doing keyleth and actually percy i need you to roll a concentration check against the damage you just took oh no you missed that's right well it would be against pike's damage so roll a concentration check against the damage that pike did to you for hex i usually forget to mention it because you don't take a lot of damage in battle most of the time hex is concentration yeah so roll a constitution check not save four hex has vanished from keyleth it's been kind of rough for you percy you have tremor sense as an earth elemental that's good to know hmm hold on a second let me check something in here it might be in here no that's an important note to bring up thank you for that let me pull up the dmg here all right let's go ahead and make sure i get this right this is the dmg now monster manual you'll answer my question pardon me folks this is going to be interesting if this works yeah what's the radius of your tremor sense vax you know is right there we're not going to play it that way they have no idea it's possible oh no you'll take some damage finally what are you doing okay so you're going to move into here okay as you think you're-- it's true so all of a sudden-- yeah it's not the hidden it's his cloak of displacement so all of a sudden you turn the corner and you see bounding up keyleth's earth elemental form zoning right in on you go ahead and make your first attack with disadvantage nope first attack misses right with disadvantage yeah so she misses but he's visible and he's there with you all right the lava has now spread and connected with the other pool there there are now two streams of molten rock all right that brings us to percy that'll hit go ahead and roll damage on pike it was already loaded right actually it's not already loaded right because you had to fix it last round sorry about that guys 18 points of piercing damage the blast hits your armor it rings in your ear for a minute but the pain from the impact of the bullet actually touching past the inside of your chest is pretty rough you can feel the bullet probably lodged itself an inch or two in pike you're up he's over here you saw him rush up what level for the spell okay go ahead and roll another spell attack yeah that'll hit so go ahead and roll another 4d10 on strength rolls you do not no 24 points of necrotic damage as pike once again comes running behind slams her hand onto you and another jolt of horrible necrotic energy strikes through your body your vision's beginning to blur a little bit at the edges what are you at now good all righty pike you still have your bonus action if you wanted to or move if you want he'll be able to get a melee attack on you if you pull away and you only have one more square of movement anyway you can move there he'll get an attack on you for free you've already used your action this turn to do the inflict wounds nope it's 1d4 plus five is what it'll be it's true so you gain six hit points all righty that ends your turn pike you good all right vax you're up go ahead and make an attack of opportunity on him with disadvantage no it meets air as he sweeps backward a bunch of various metallic and glass marbles all spill out onto the ground around you all right there it is the dmg it spilled down (chuckles) what else are you doing buddy okay go ahead and make a stealth check all right is now the time percy you do get to make a perception roll you know where he is you have no idea whereabouts he's gone off to i need you to go ahead and make an athletics check to leap ashley and no you can't parkour over molten rock you manage to just skirt over the molten area and not go plummeting a second time with your foot in lava that brings us to keyleth's turn what are you doing it's a 60-foot radius right where are you again show me i'm just seeing the range here all right no you do not sense him you felt him run this way and then vanish so you go ahead and take a blow on this wall there the whole wall is technically what you'd be going for okay you have to move forward to do that i want you to make a dexterity check you (grunting) sliding on the marbles just barely get yourself there you don't fall prone but you get yourself to the wall make your attack the first fist hits it and the wall is stronger than you thought it kind of hurts your knuckles at the impact yeah go ahead and roll damage for the second strike you slam into the wall and rocks break and shoot forward this section of the wall now is currently visible through you can travel past or see through it percy and pike you look behind you as you hear the slamming of rock and you can see part of the wall slam forward and behind it a very angry earth elemental i'm going to go ahead and mark that as an open part of the wall you can still move or do you want to stay there into that area you're still scooting over the marbles but you made your check this turn you pull back and this area is still pretty bad for you that finishes keyleth's turn percy you're up (clang) across her armor her thick armored exterior deflects the blow the blade doesn't make any sort of impact or wound what's your ac right now all right that hits roll your damage i've been forgetting the concentration checks for your spell that you had on giving you the ac bonus it's fine we'll do it now go ahead and roll a constitution check just roll a d20 and add your constitution modifier total nine you lose your plus two ac bonus spell so your ac is now naturally the 20 normally that ends your turn percy pike you're up go ahead and roll a physical attack against percy 23 i believe hits against your armor class right go ahead and roll damage it's a d6 because it's a shortsword an extra d6 of cold damage and an extra d8 of-- sorry 3d6 is what it is no it's an extra d8 i think let me go check the war cleric bonus you don't do a lot of melee pardon me folks right but because you're war-based you have divine strike it's an extra d8 so 2d6 plus 1d8 there we go my apologies pike reaches back and slams into you with the frostbrand the cut of the blade is hard enough but the cold enchantment on it causes the wound itself to seal with ice anything else you want to do pike you have your bonus action still and your movement if you wanted to try to move away it's up to you you just used your action shield of faith is a bonus action then yeah you can so with that your radiant field of protective energy begins to shimmer across your upper torso again helping to improve your armor class are you going to stay where you are or are you going to move this way you do get your attack of opportunity against her so roll damage ten points of slashing damage against you pike as you back away percy gets one strike with the weapon as you turn around the corner all right that ends your turn vax you're up oh vax real fast i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw that is not going to work you take 20 points of radiant damage as a guardian in this vicinity all of a sudden-- so you take half damage you take ten points of radiant damage as you rush by all of a sudden an unseen guardian of energy comes forming out of the wall and slams into you as you pass yeah you did this technically would have happened last turn yeah because i forgot it last turn so it's another ten damage mark that no it's just damage okay 24 all right percy what's your ac all right so that's a hit a dagger comes out of nowhere as you look over just in time to see it coming at you you're going to go ahead and-- all right go ahead and attempt to missile snare well no it's a reaction to do it isn't it you've already used your reaction to do that attack of opportunity against pike yeah so yeah you don't have the reaction to do it unfortunately 36 points of piercing damage against you with that percy you fall to the ground the dagger sticking out of the side of your neck you are currently-- pinned you to the wall we'll say as you fall back the blade takes you and pins you against the wall you are (dying sound) eyes roll back closed i mean you could all right pike i need you to go ahead and roll a perception check 13 okay yeah you see a flash as vax runs past you and then disappears around the corner all righty so with that it is keyleth's turn you sensed vax run this way and then vanish from your current visual range of tremor sense yep go ahead and make another dexterity saving throw yeah you manage to just scoot past him again without falling over you would have sensed vax actually moving last round even then because you didn't move that far you do know where he is what are you doing keyleth okay you can see through this wall still i mean you still remember where he was but your tremor sense is no longer there so you have to-- flaming sphere okay where is flaming sphere going to go you're still not dead yet you're unconscious if you manage to-- which happened in our last battle royale-- roll a natural 20 on a death saving throw you come back to consciousness so flaming sphere at 4th level that means you'll be doing 4d6 fire damage where are you putting it okay right there or right on there it's a five-foot diameter sphere that's how big it is okay bright light shines in the area and from your visual perspective you show up because of where you are where's your figure the flaming sphere appears so that's your action and as a bonus action you can move the sphere up to 30 feet if you wanted to to ram it into something the sphere starts slamming into you make a dexterity saving throw you do 26 unfortunately he dodges out of the sphere as it slams into the wall percy you take a death saving throw automatically as the flaming sphere rolls over your current unconscious body pinned against the wall yeah you do you're one down well you can't hide you used your action okay so there you are behind the wall ending your turn keyleth percy roll another death saving throw no she's already made her roll this turn ten or higher is what you want that's a second death saving throw you're down two pike you're up you see this burst of flame and around the corner you see a very visible vax just out of the corner of your eye dodge the fire yeah this is the one time you will all right with flame strike suddenly fire and divine light come bursting up in a column around you up to the ceiling in a horrible spray of flame i need you to make a dexterity saving throw no that's 8d6 fire damage and 8d6 radiant-- sorry 4d6 fire 4d6 radiant so yeah 8d6 points of damage and percy incinerates his body is turned to ash you set it to necrotic i know but you said necrotic so you take half damage of whatever this is (chuckles) hashtag no mercy for percy (laughter) 21 points of damage to you you take ten points of damage you can still move if you want you have not moved yet 2nd-level so 2d4 plus five nice so 12 points of healing to you and you want to move as well over here there she can where you were yeah okay using the light of sarenrae to hopefully guide you that ends your turn pike vax you're up pike's hiding out there's still a little bit of line of sight on you just on the edge based on the square you are on that's where his corpse was on right now and there's a big flaming sphere that's also lighting up the area there's no real darkness there obscuring yourself is the only way that would aid you yeah it's chilling there burning on this side as you pull back you see vax pop around the corner throw a dagger and it streaks off your shield and you knock it out of the way yes you can see through this part of the wall right there that wall is still there okay go ahead and make a perception check pike you have no idea where vax is vax has essentially vanished from view finishing that turn comes to keyleth nope you hid to keep out of the view of everything to be fair currently vax has no idea where you are either if you peek around right now you can go and look if you want to okay as you peek around the corner pike is currently not visible nope a non-rogue leaping over there probably yeah you make noise when you run anyway regardless only a stealthy character who's already hidden that it would be a thing what do you got keyleth do you have any spells that cover an area that are helpful like faerie fire anything like that rough call against a rogue that would have been clutch but now you know for the future just letting you know it was very good sleet storm's an action with a 40-foot radius centered at a point you choose within range yep where do you want to place it you saw him in this area centered from where centering it from there will only get this section if you center it further out you'll hit more of an area just so you know from a tactical standpoint it's a 40-foot radius it's going to hit everything know that the radius is very big on this so before you put it too close to a wall you can have more space flaming sphere drops all right so the center is where that is the center of your sleet storm suddenly out of nowhere a burst of freezing rain and sleet starts spilling out of the sky conjured from this temporal portal that pulls from some distant elemental dimension as it hits the ground a lot of the lava begins to cool and darken in certain areas this area begins to cool a little bit not entirely but it's beginning to fight against the cold temperature at the start of its turn yep that's true is that your action and do you move anywhere or do you stay where you are yeah you tuck back against the wall there you are so that brings us to-- no longer percy percy is gone sorry buddy crossing you off there pike your turn begins this sleet and rain is hitting you from all over the place i need you to make a dexterity saving throw eight you immediately fall prone as the slick ice causes you to fall to the ground which means it'll take half your movement to stand up not a huge deal however any spells you are concentrating in you have to make a successful constitution saving throw so make a constitution saving throw you lose your armor spell again so you're back down to an ac of 20 pike now's your turn okay you have ten more feet to move so two more squares if you wanted to magic circle is a one-minute casting time that will take you ten rounds to cast yeah sorry girl spirit guardians at what level which is the basic level all of a sudden there is another entity that has swirled around you this spectral image of sarenrae is now looming over pike's form just waiting ending pike's turn now up to vax you have your bonus still if you wanted to do that as a bonus action that's two concentration spells at once you'll lose spirit guardians yeah sorry okay so heal seven that brings us to vax what are you doing buddy technically she's inside this area there she's tucked against the wall much like how you were tucked against the wall there you know she's around there but you'd probably have to traverse-- she'd be further spaced out from there sorry yes however at the start of your turn i need you to make a dexterity saving throw because of the sleet around you 21 what's the dc on your spell keyleth yes it is 19 yeah so you save you're fine no damage no prone this wall's open yeah so she would have no cover on this 21 is that your ac with that sneak attack damage against keyleth 33 points of piercing damage against you keyleth as the dagger hits you in the back of the shoulder you feel a sharp pain it's weird being on the opposing end of vax's daggers make a stealth check pike i need you to roll a perception check okay and with that i need vax to make a dexterity saving throw 21 you manage to pull through the vicinity without any impact ending vax's turn keyleth you're up mm-hmm although you do need to roll a concentration for the attack against you which was thirty-what 19 would be more than half you're fine and you maintain concentration half of that would have been 16 or 17 yeah you don't see her you haven't seen her for a while technically also vax once again i need you to make a wisdom saving throw as well 13 (chuckles) you take 3d8 radiant damage yep so go ahead and roll 3d8 as the spirit guardian that's been looming over and can see over the wall and that whole vicinity-- as you run past both of those spells blast at you one of them you manage to dodge but the sarenrae guardian reaches out and slams a giant light blade down into you no because you're currently hiding behind the wall it is a blast of energy but from a styling standpoint it's a-- you can uncanny dodge-- no this is not a spell attack against you it just happens so no uncanny dodge would not help you on this he already went through that and saved fine so you take 12 points of radiant damage at the end of your turn now it's keyleth right make a perception check natural one not yet no you did see some flashes of divine energy in that vicinity but that's all you see yeah in this general vicinity you haven't seen her for a while it's up to you you can-- yeah you have plenty of room there you can do all the way across there if you wanted to you can do that if you wanted to however it's a concentration-- no we made into an instant spell the concentration made no sense for wall of stone for older editions that being the case we're looking at-- currently now stone wall's up here and stone wall's up here you have no idea all right does that end you turn keyleth keyleth does that end your turn all right pike you're up okay you tuck against the wall if you want to go ahead and look around yeah you've already made your perception check i'd say if you really wanted to honestly look for him i'd let you take an action to do it yeah you have no idea where he is right now yeah you saw it go off around that area and strike down over the edge of the wall this way (singing) insect plague (normal voice) it is concentration so this would-- up to you it is a 20-foot radius where do you want to put it which one around this area okay so keeping you outside the radius where do you want it to go this whole area there the center where it went off okay but keeping you out of the radius i imagine so maybe putting you about there would get this whole area there you drop down insect plague your spirit guardian vanishes as instead suddenly swirling from the cracks in the ground a cloud of biting scarabs locusts and various poisonous insects begin to fill the area the loud buzzing sound fills the entire area vax i need you to make a constitution saving throw no she said where it happened but away from herself it would have been-- natural one 4d10 piercing damage no it's just piercing damage things biting and clawing at him correct yeah only against directed spell attacks four what you did do 13 points of piercing damage you see all of a sudden all the insects coalesce and start biting in an area you see the shape of vax appearing in this corner there briefly as the insects are biting you want to move still you can move over there if you want to so through the pains and anger and the cloud you can just-- the area is lightly obscured you can but you'll lose your insect plague it's concentration yeah the insects stay until you leave the area so let's see here that's part of that there ending pike's turn that brings us to vax there is no way to see through these walls right now technically it's in the design however you do also need to make a dexterity saving throw as you rush into the radius technically yeah thank you for reminding me this will be the sleet storm you make one as well three you would have not been able to get over there you would have gotten to there with your full movement you had to use half of it to get up she technically only got that far so you know okay now make another dexterity check no a dexterity saving throw sorry as you rush into the radius of her guardian-- no she has two up one of them isn't concentration it lasts for eight hours it's what he does got it okay that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up you watch as this cloud of insects appears in this corner you see a coughing vax run this way to the edge and then disappear behind that wall he disappears through this little channel here and he doesn't appear to leave it there's still insects filling this whole space here this is getting real interesting yeah not too bad okay so we'll say cube cube cube covering this vicinity here okay so suddenly the ground already hot bursts forth in flames surrounding the whole area what's the saving throw on that pike i need you to roll a dex saving throw yeah just pike all right go ahead and roll damage i know someone in the chat's paying attention and i lost track of that how many rounds have we gone so far i should not have asked chat (laughs) okay so just so you're aware the surge of energy that you felt from your boots has faded you no longer have the haste enchantment yeah it's been 13 you've technically had it for more rounds than you should've but it's fine all right so is that your turn what else are you doing okay so you move back into this little area there are you moving further back this way or staying in that same pocket there okay we'll say there all right cool that ends keyleth's turn pike you're up the flames that erupt around you subside you're finding yourself singed and burned and angry i need you to go ahead and roll a constitution check to see if you maintain-- how much damage did you take total from that 48 damage roll a constitution check you have to beat a 24 insect plague fades away the insects subside and vanish go for it what level are you doing it level four okay i'm pretty sure this is all your 4th-level spells right you have one more you have two but i'm pretty sure spirit guardians-- you put that at a higher level that's right what was it guardian-- no that's true your guardian of faith was 4th-level you couldn't do that at a higher level so this would be your last 4th-level spell oh so the ring gives you an additional four levels in spells okay okay they have to have already been prepared is how it would work we'll say you had your guardian spirit as what you had in there as part of your plan anyway so that's fine we're using the basic gear you would have normally so technically you would have that ring there was a 3rd-level one anyway for the time being as we're on it's a one-time thing over here back around this way or this way okay this section okay all right that ends pike's turn vax you're up pike as you run up all of a sudden you hear a ting and a blade streaks off the back of your armor you turn the corner and you see vax looking there sheepishly you do you're no longer hasted yeah that would be a solid wall go ahead and roll a perception check just to keep that in mind no you just see him duck on the other side of the wall and vanish rogues man okay that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up nope you can't see anybody no these walls are full walls these aren't little nope your guess is as good as anybody's sleet storm was dropped guys it's all good yeah you took a bunch of damage no you didn't it's still going i'm so confused by all your spells i'm trying to keep all this in my head ugh okay pike make a dex save yeah even though you probably didn't move that far so you would have just moved back half your movement so you're fine it's fine didn't make a huge difference it's true you do confuse me love you guys but you do confuse me no you have locked yourself into a bunker with a very limited viewpoint so you can either wait it out or start making a guessing game you didn't see anything you ducked behind that wall still insects over here dashes of light over here yeah and you saw pike over here get flamed sure make a perception check (laughter) yeah you're such an asshole remember you can also hold your action in case something-- you can have a spell ready and have it trigger for a spell that can happen once it occurs so that's 2d8 plus six for you 13 you heal 13 hit points pike you're up so 2d8 plus five all right shield of faith is up again protecting you standing where you are not moving anywhere all right cool vax you're up oh at the top of your turn by the way because sleet's still moving dexterity saving throw you didn't move so it wouldn't have made a huge difference anyway so that's fine she cast it at the end of her turn she already lost concentration because of your last flaming column of fire of doom so dexterity saving throw yeah you're fine all right that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up this is your action to take your perception by the way bonus action we'll say 27 what did you roll are you looking through this way you don't see anything until okay good to know all right that brings us to pike's turn pike what are you doing you can't hold your whole turn you have an action prepared what do you want to do with your action okay so you're going to hold your attack action until somebody attacks you okay that brings us to vax's turn okay it is now keyleth's turn i'm going to give you damage for that (laughs) i'm kidding this is turning into a bad counterstrike match real fast looking out where nothing you're on deck pike you didn't cast it it never happened yeah you didn't actually cast it you were ready that if it happened you would do it immediately you could do the same thing if you wanted to though it seems like everyone is doing nothing right now so if this continues i'm going to have to shake things up it is but the sleet spell has cooled it and most of this now is darkened rock again actually due to the constant cold rain and snow it's still hot in there but there's a shell of rock over it you're not sure how strong it is also how does the sleet spell work you may have walked into your own spell radius when a creature enters the spell area yeah if you don't want to do that you can back up but otherwise you'd be walking right into your sleet spell yeah it's a 40-foot radius so it's out to here what are you doing yup yup so you have a ten-foot-wide column you can put anywhere for 30 feet starting from where okay five ten 15 20 25 30 would just hit pike all right so pike as you're waiting and waiting all of a sudden you see this surge of water come splashing across the way towards you you turn-- make a dexterity check or a dexterity saving throw sorry tidal wave it's what she used to destroy the elementals so you take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone here 17 points of bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone as the wave crashes over you dissipating into the stonework around leaving little puddles that begin to steam and boil upon the impact across the ground even as the sleet storm is crashing all around you all righty you're up pike okay at the top of your turn you need to make a constitution saving throw yeah so you maintain your armor you can move there that's about as far as you can get with only half your movement left so if you want to just make an attack up here okay roll an attack 28 whoosh through the air nothing there all right is that all you're going to do on your turn all right vax you're up that will drop stealth okay are you holding what you were holding before okay okay got it all right cool that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up no nobody's in view right now (laughter) (laughs) all right what are you doing keyleth okay you will lose sleet storm you good with that sleet storm has been somewhat effectual with pike but she's not moving much doesn't seem to affect so it's up to you it can be useful you drop it and go call lightning sleet storm ceases as suddenly a small cloud begins to form at the top of this chamber you hear the crackling and rolling thunder as little flashes of electrical energy begin to appear across the ceiling there okay with that (thunder) a blast of lightning hits the floor smashes into the ground rocks get thrown no apparent effect all right you going to go back in your corner all right pike you're up last fourth spell death ward on pike boom i'm going to wait-- what else are you doing you can make a spiritual weapon that can move around and be a danger but can't really make it to help you see stuff i mean an extra bonus action attack doesn't hurt if something does show up so up to you what do you want to do okay what level okay so a basic spiritual weapon appears i'll go with this yellow one where do you want it to go right above you all right so that'll be right there okay that end your turn all right suddenly-- the entirety of the room begins to quake and shift you hear the cracking as all of a sudden every stone wall bursts forth and molten rock begins to spill into the territory all the walls now five feet of lava have filled in show me on the map where you last were yes show me okay i need you to make a dexterity saving throw don't have advantage anymore because haste is gone yeah it's plenty so you dodge out of the way just in time however you guys watch as all the walls now within five feet of them are now just spilling lava and it's filling into the room you get the sense that it's going to continue to fill with each passing round all the walls are slowly closing in until the room fills with lava no you do not it is now vax's turn from what you can tell you don't see her you don't see her okay all right just a little to where give me specifically sorry guys all right so you hear in the distance this kind of hissing sound hand me the sheet real fast so i-- as from around the corner a tiny serpent appears and lashes out at you keyleth simon a very familiar friend rears back and strikes at you being the poisonous snake that it is go ahead and roll a d20 all right it strikes at you and you just kinda step back and go aw simon but there is now a tiny little snake there all righty that ends your turn all right keyleth you're up no not really the wall's too high the walls are about ten feet up perception check as a bonus action okay good to know all right pike you're up blight or call lightning which one are you going to do okay usually you tell what spell you're preparing okay good to know as a bonus action you can move it 20 feet and repeat an attack against a creature within five feet okay cool top of the round the lava begins to pool further into the room you guys notice now as molten rock is now beginning to spill at the ten-foot radius around the walls pike it's starting to get close to closing off the exit of this wall you see it now beginning to spill into this lava form there correct but it's still spilling out of all the walls on each side you need to make another dexterity check you stepped one in away from it and then it moved in one more one you take 42 points of fire damage as the lava surges past you you manage to just step out of the very edge but a familiar sensation hits you as the severe pain you once held in one foot you now feel in both all righty vax it's your turn the moment you appear keyleth you get your blight spell no it's ranged it's a 30-foot range as soon as you appear no constitution saving throw all right that is 8d8 necrotic damage against you you do have necrotic resistance so 14 points of necrotic damage to you you're down all right keyleth it's your turn vax is down it's up to you what do you want to do you don't do anything as she kicks your unconscious form into the molten rock and your body slowly burns away this isn't so much about death saving throws as your unconscious body unable to do anything is being pushed slowly into molten rock vax is no more you watch as the molten rock takes his arm as it slowly disappears beneath the lava marisha it turns into a middle finger and disappears beneath the molten rock so that's your action kicking his body into the lava what do you want to do now you still have a move and a bonus if you wanted to use it i know you wouldn't sink in lava it's fantasy lava every time i look over to chat there's just someone-- ugh it's fun we're having a good time she pushed him partially into it and he just burst into flames is what really would have happened but it's fine it's all good the physics in exandria are different than your normal mortal realm all right so you move over there and you're done so 1d4 plus six and pike you're up after this all right pike you're up dude you had a good game all right you peek around the corner and you see keyleth immediately off across the lava you also see there is lava lapping at your foot and you can see it moving slowly in your direction well first off the sleet spell you let go for call lightning that's five ten you can move all the way over here if you want it's up to you or over here okay you move right there all right and you can use your bonus action to move your blade if you want to as well 20 feet so you're going to do that five ten where do you want to go for the rest of it towards keyleth 15 20 it just floats over the lava so it's fine oh you're about to find out is what you're about to find out oh no okay keyleth make a constitution saving throw (giggling) oh no all right you take 14d6 necrotic damage re-roll the cocked one that's fine 44 points of necrotic damage by the way your max health is also reduced by 44 what does that bring you to 51 hit points all right so that's your harm spell yep that's it you're done all right keyleth top of the round the lava pools in even further and now three squares away from the wall are currently filled now so you guys are starting to get pushed into the lava pool in the center you probably have two very careful rounds before you're both taking lava damage yeah you guys can see each other it's right down to this lava-filled room the glow of the molten rock around you under-lighting you both as you're standing in the center around this pool staring at one another for the final showdown you hear the laughing of the beyonder in the distance (doofus-esque voice) heh heh this is great all right pike i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw your favorite oh shit all right so roll 3d10 lightning damage halved 11 points of lightning damage as the lightning hits you charging though your body the war cleric in you fills up with even more rage all right so a vine whips out 30 feet (counting) yeah she's in range all right so pike i need you to make a dexterity saving throw the vine streaks out black and charred almost like the dead forest-type exterior it whips around you and drags you forward 20 feet into the center of the lava you take-- (giggling) oh my god this is not good for you all right so that's 45 points of fire damage as you're now being pulled into this hard but super molten rock shell your whole body bursts into flames as now the flaming fires of righteousness of sarenrae are now met by the flaming fires of your flesh actually burning off what are you at health-wise keyleth that's the end of your turn all right pike you're up pike you can move out of this because if you stay in there at the end of your turn you're going to take the damage again the vine's still right there ready to grab you again the grasping vine itself is more of an effect that she can continue to have more vines grow out of it so it's not going to do much you've seen it before you know how it works the vine can only pull towards it yeah so if you were to move towards the vine it wouldn't be able to pull you into the lava again essentially which direction the vine's right there the lava has now pooled into here you're only really going to have this space and this space yeah you haven't done anything all you did was move as a bonus action you could move this over to attack her if you wanted to yeah as a bonus action although it is a concentration spell and i need you to roll against 44 points of damage roll a constitution check plus your constitution oh with your constitution nah spiritual weapon is gone if you wanted to try and shove her there is lava right behind her there you can command one word you can try let me see here let me look at this real fast it has no effect if your command is directly harmful to it so it wouldn't work this is going to be interesting all right so you move into here well you can probably do it from here because technically you're both adjacent at this point go ahead and you can make a shove as your attack make a strength (athletics) check all right you can roll either an athletics or an acrobatics check keyleth pike rushes around the corner with her shield and slams into you you get pushed back into the lava that has curled out from that side let's see yeah okay so keyleth takes as part of this action 19 29 35 points of fire damage from the shove you're alive all right pike does that end your turn you haven't used your bonus action yet i don't think you used your action to shove what spell is it divine word let me pull this up real fast divine word is a bonus action yeah (laughs in surprise) okay yeah you can do this you can yeah because you used your action to shove all right keyleth i need you to make a charisma saving throw (laughs) i know how many hit points are you at ashley how do you want to do this so how divine word works you utter a divine word imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation because clerics choose any number of creatures you can see within range each creature that can hear you must make a charisma saving throw on a failed save a creature suffers an effect based on its hit points 50 or lower they're deafened for a minute 40 or lower they're deafened and blinded for ten minutes 30 or lower they're blinded deafened and stunned for an hour 20 hit points or lower killed instantly ashley how do you want to do this she's in the lava right now as you slam her head down radiant divine energy fills the space around you and then curls dark as you push your friend face-down into the lava you hear her screams muffled as the molten rock begins to consume her hair burning off her head the divine energy protecting you from the heat as you pull back suddenly this smoldering smoky ruin that was once keyleth begins to slowly melt away against the tide of lava the pouring rock halts in place as a voice goes and i have my victor suddenly the lava right behind you tears open and you find yourself falling plummeting into darkness and the plummeting turns into just falling and falling then light begins to fill the space beneath you and you look down as a small platform of marble approaches you you think you're about to crash into it at full terminal velocity instead your feet gingerly touch and you come to stand there the same strange white-clad jheri curl-haired gentleman walks up to you and goes well played and high-fives you i'll send you on back your friends are fine and then you see the corpses of your three friends rise up out of the marble still as wrecked as they were from the battle it's a little disturbing he hasn't restored them to their actual form they all start shambling towards you he goes oh sorry about that er this was a dream snaps and he goes to darkness well done congratulations (cheering) four hit points the lava pushing in that was crazy i didn't realize that was a bonus action it would have brought you back to one (laughing) oh that sucks you put necrotic resistance specifically because you were afraid of blight yeah aww spell resistance gives you advantage on spell saving throws yes no it would've yep it was a charisma saving throw roll again the outcome's already happened but what was your charisma bonus your charisma saving throw bonus is plus three well this is a valuable lesson in remembering what your spells can do possibly yeah it was an epic end it all balances out it all comes out in the wash that divine man that's such a cool ability but be aware that she still had death ward so even if you did hit her with that-- done something else yes either way that was an epic end man cleric victory both battle royales we've had yeah everyone out there is like eh i don't want to play a cleric yeah that saved you staying off to the side and healing yourself with your bonus actions and stuff when no one was around hey man that's what saved you yeah well done guys you guys were down to the wire as far as spell options one day all of vox machina no you have to understand you guys had a lot of stand-away characters in this throwing grog in the mix changes everything very quickly he can move quickly and tear your face off quickly and having vex over there who does a shit-ton of damage from a distance and sam of course being sam having all of you guys in one arena fighting i'm looking forward to it it's going to be a real crazy fight when it happens and he's got war caster so he gets advantage on his concentration checks too it's fine you still succeeded everyone's saying happy birthday liam and laura yeah they're all wishing you happy birthday
