these shirts that your closet has a section that's just my face yeah it's just this face is printed and just having your wife eventually come up to me and having you go-- all righty then without further ado let's jump into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] no that's not true (laughs) that's not how this works (laughter) so as the last episode wound down and friendships were strengthened you all then began to ponder about what you wanted to do with the time before you and today we return approximately one year after we left off so we met earlier this week to discuss this we went through a various number of things you wanted to accomplish both as individuals and some of you in groups so we're going to go ahead and go over those elements for you guys and get everyone up to speed with what exactly has transpired in this year period of time so who would like to begin share elements of it and then some elements will be roleplayed because that's what i want to do yeah so all right so grog what are some of the things you did no you did not yeah so you now have kevdak's bear-totem tattoo that was on his chest now on your back out of sheer disrespect for him i love it yeah yeah okay that's delicious yeah met multiple times including once against a familiar individual called kern the hammer yeah and did not prevail however he did come back to you requesting to learn and train under you to teach him your ways to which you said-- you said no that's what you told me at least so so as you are wandering down an evening byway in the quadroads of vasselheim a number of cups in yourself you hiccup loudly and glance off to the side to find one gentleman who's been far deeper in his cups and is currently trying to steady himself against the stone wall in an alleyway what oh if you're buying yeah you think if i did i'd be drinking this hard i have no idea yeah you're near a thoroughfare and there's a small alley off to the side make a persuasion check with advantage because he's really drunk this is terrible (laughs) you watch as in the center of his pupils a little sparkle of interest kicks in and i mean five percent soberer at the prospect of something fun of this stranger that gave him a drink and goes wait what are you talking about (belches) he takes a second and looks around looks at the deck is this some sort of a magic trick all right do you want me to tell you what it is okay let me get my cards out yeah maybe no no no huh i'm going to let somebody else pull this who wants to pull it okay (laughs) hold on i have to roll a die first (laughs) he takes the card and looks at it turns around and shows you and it's this tarot card of a beautiful moonscape with an open night sky i believe that's what it is yeah that's what it is he puts it back in the deck and is like all right what's the trick i'm-- i'm feeling a little-- a little strange and he's like trying to contemplate it he goes wait a second i wish that i was a powerful lord of the quadroads and there's a strange tingling visual image as the cloth around him that was tattered and worn-out becomes beautiful silks-- the drunkenness fades from him ever-so-slightly and now he looks washed and you glance over at the far end of the alleyway and there's a guy there who's dressed in long long tails and a coat and goes sir how long are you going to be he goes right with you i don't even know what his name is well thank you so much stranger and he pats you on the shoulder grog grog strongthings great i still got one more of these and he walks off and runs off to the carriage 1d3 wishes the queen of diamonds was the card you didn't get his name he just runs off well let me see here let me see let me see once the card is drawn it fades from existence yeah but you know what that one's gone now just double-checking to make sure the card goes away and it does according to how it's written okay i was like oh god is he going to draw another card okay then you in your time away radically changed some poor man's life and apparently wished himself to some level of nobility within the quadroads of vasselheim with one wish still standing well there are many lords and ladies of the quadroads he's just now one of them i was thinking to myself it was either going to be that or some grim reaper's going to show up and cut his head off so if this happened early in your year do you still resist the urge as the year progresses how long does it take until the urge creeps up again which actually plays into her opening the other thing you did which happens towards the end of the year is you said you went to the frostweald mm-hm she thanked you lycanthropy is scattered throughout the planes now you do she passed that information on to you all right so that's the truncated example of grog's year we might come back to it here in a minute next up would be pike because that's a good transition point there so what'd you do check in on your temple that you built there yeah and as everyone was pitting both of you against each other for another championship bout you both decided to-- you can slowly read four- to five-letter words he knows how to write his name now and he can write a full sentence over a short rest we'll cross that bridge when we get to it (laughter) wilhand yeah he's doing good the home that was damaged in the umbrasyl attack on westruun your room has been repaired though it's taken a little while because it's mainly just him hiring who he can at the time but he's doing well he's an old gnome but still kicking around still doing his best still doing his prayers to sarenrae glad to see you coming saying hi if you ask him about that ask him where fassbender is he's like oh this nice older fella came by and said it was his property so i gave it back to him he seemed very-- -- very intent on receiving his property and i wasn't about to argue yeah some of the trickfoots bear claws is that it did you guys make bear claws whitestone needs more commerce and there are plenty of vacant buildings that are starting to fill up as people move back in you did yeah yeah it led you all the way to emon i think it was then it went cold yeah we'll get to that yeah we'll get to that all right who wants to go next yes you discovered that there was an offspring there was a singular offspring in the parchwood not too far from where you saw it emerge in your vision and upon finally finding it it was young and defensive and feral and after-- very angry and day after day you returned with various foods and meat and trying to connect with it and did not succeed yeah it fled southward into the parchwood and while you now have sent your grey hunt that is now working below you to keep an eye out for it it has not been seen since yeah mm-hm yeah you're having a teleportation circle placed within your estate in whitestone and at the end of the year it's still two weeks out from creation so it's going to take a little while longer but it is in the process yeah yeah you did also research some-- all right and vax which is why i led it along this way so yeah just right there right next to the barbed wire part of your process there once you had been fully accepted into the order there some of the few responsibilities you had were you were called whenever relatively important figures in the city had passed away to go and give rites when they were interred and be present during a number of funerals in there that was one of the earlier responsibilities that was given to you within vasselheim while you were there yes yeah you've arranged a respect there is no familial bond per se with him but a lot of the tension has died away and there is a business positive interaction no and he acknowledges that and he seems both simultaneously proud and sad almost a mild regret that perhaps i think he realizes now what he missed out on kind of exactly all righty and i think i'm to marisha as keyleth keyleth what you got going on yeah they are heavily under guard it's not like you have to make the armor you commission the armor you enchanted it for five months yeah coattails of the tempest maybe not that one and thus another meme was built (laughter) i'm sorry tary came along too so the five of you guys took a journey into the feywild in search of the theatre you weren't there (laughs) so after searching for a few days up northward in the forest where you recall seeing portions of the tree-- canopy line shifting and seemingly vanishing and then reappearing you eventually stumbled upon a large wooden structure-- circular and tall almost like a giant crown of wood it sat there-- and noticed that the mists that hugged the base of this marsh as it's slowly recovering since sondur fell still thick marshland but not quite as disgusting and corrupt as it once was the mists that clouded this area were all gathering towards this wooden structure and you begin to see shapes in the mist heads faces bodies and you begin to realize that these were all spirits of the marsh being summoned to this structure you all went disguised as various small flying insects-- or beast creatures-- and managed to stealth into the entrance doors into this mossy marsh-rotted wood structure and on the inside saw the mist form an audience within the inside of this globe theatre-like structure upon which the central platform remained a strange crystalline spark began to form upon that stage where a doorway opened and then stepping from it a half-dozen elvish-looking figures though their skin is pale white-gray their eyes white and iris-less their limbs lithe and thinner and longer than elves you're used to seeing in your experience and while none of you could understand-- or most of you could understand the language except for keyleth and taryon i think it was yeah you guys were the only ones who could understand it because you both knew sylvan what you saw was a brilliant three-act performance for the undead spirits of the surrounding marsh unaware of the serious danger if any of you had been discovered (laughs) no you don't know go back go back however you watched the performance entirely did not gather their attention at which the entity stepped back into a doorway and it closed off and you absconded from the theatre before the rest of the audience could shift its way out and become the mists of the forests once again you don't know you only know what they told you yeah so as you guys returned from this and described your experience to percy the only person who really had spent a large portion of his youth researching the feywild and having an interest in these fey creatures and their societies-- all right so your adventure to finally find the theatre complete i believe that concludes your immediate ventures percival of course you did yeah you guys converted into the chamber of whitestone which is less of a singular family ruling and more of a small series of offices held by lords or ladies you tried you rolled a one and then you rolled a two riflemen of whitestone i'm sorry percy but no it's a heavy endeavor it's going to take a while to complete it's begun work yeah that's pretty much everything you've got here all right all right and taryon you're such a terrible person tary tary tary tary the door itself is also a crest once and then takes a short rest to reload yep you don't know how to make armor so you had the armor commissioned using the remains of vorugal's hide no sorry you have vorugal-- the remains of umbrasyl's hide yes all right is that the end of that yes awesome all right so as the months go by and you all have your individual adventures as you converse and talk amongst yourselves the date of winter's crest begins to creep up now winter's crest is a day that's really only celebrated in tal'dorei proper-- occasionally by people in other places who migrated away from tal'dorei but the event that it's based around eravon the ice lord was specific to tal'dorei it's not celebrated everywhere in the world however it is coming up and you all decided to celebrate your winter's crest festival this year not in tal'dorei you all instead made your way towards the bay of gifts in marquet now how are you guys getting there are you taking a leisurely boat trip are you going via trees oh that's right before you even left there you-- keyleth helped you with this one specifically senokir yeah very happy to help you and i greatly appreciated you being so honorable thank you what do you need from me understood right away (laughter) goodbye you receive word via imp strangely enough which sets you off for a moment there but you are notified of their completion and they're delivered finished by this imp there you go right in the center of the mantle right there tary (laughter) and that's it not always oh all right and as you guys-- the ball is complete you've all gathered your hangovers have faded you all begin your trek toward the bay of gifts that's up to you guys (sing) takes me away to where i've always--- bah-derr i don't know what those are all right so you make your way to emon then you charter a ship across the ozmit sea and make your way to the continent of marquet on the northeast base of the aggrad mountains of marquet which consume a sizable portion of the continent's north shore there before you stands as it comes across the horizon a brilliant crescent-shaped bay of white sands glittering clear turquoise-colored waters and the grandiose port city of shamal hundreds of ships fill the bay from small fishing vessels to massive cargo ships bringing an ever-flowing mixture of cultures goods and characters from across exandria to its sunny location now while back home winter's crest brings seasonal rain and snow here in the bay of gifts the sky is clear the water is warm and the sun is ever-shining throughout the day the streets of the city are draped in white and gold silks affixed and framing crossways and street corners between torch posts and buildings the distant sound of waves and seagulls cawing seems to envelop the city at all hours occasionally stemmed by the sounds of localized musicians so as you arrived here about midday or so you take in the nice salty air into your lungs you have your belongings your sacks at your side the city is bustling what do you want to do with your vacation (laughs) all right so who's helming this journey here this search for-- all right make an investigation check all right if you're helping her that's advantage for her on it then 17 okay roughly 20 or so gold later you find the party affixed with the finest of marquesian sandals (laughs) (laughter) right next to a brilliant bright white sandstone structure that appears to be the actual resort if you will it's a wide tavern single-story but well-staffed and not terribly busy but it seems to be very nice and akin to some of the best places you've been to in your previous excursions on vacation so as you arrive there you are met with a male dark-skinned somewhat balding marquesian halfling at the front desk who smiles as you approach he puts out his hands welcome friends you are here for a-- i imagine to stay within the closet laura and ah i am guath and this is for all of you i will have to charge for your friend i am sorry you're lucky i'm not charging twice he's a very big guy that goes for that one as well then he won't order food but he's going to sleep somewhere yes laura taliesin and well then is he okay with staying out on the beach tary okay very well so that would be ba-da-da-- seven and a half seven we'll go with seven how long do you plan to stay ten days let me see here and he brings up this small abacus and starts doing math really quickly on the side you see nine days you said ten days all right we'll put that at an even-- with discount for friendships 1500 gold for the entire stay (laughs) oh no i'm sorry well we have a restaurant within as well and there are plenty of places to eat around the way we are happy to bring it to your quarters but there is a surcharge for it of course uh we do not run discounts here unfortunately we are a very premier establishment here in the bay of gifts so do you wish to stay or not all right fantastic so you pay off the 1500 mark that off on the party gold you are given some keys-- (laughs) make a persuasion check (laughter) this is training for your vacation next week what is your persuasion as you're telling him this he goes well i-- that's right because you trained in persuasion as part of the skills feat that's right so your charisma is-- sorry just making sure on the math on this one don't want to get lost what's your charisma 14 plus two plus-- so it would be plus eight unless you had something else to add under persuasion regardless you rolled really high we'll go over the math later i don't recognize you but we've had many travelers and you seem-- he looks over the group a bit especially the large one free drinks why not i'd be happy to give you this he reaches behind the counter and brings out a couple of these small wooden coins he passes them out all right that is five six-- he doesn't drink you said so that is just seven there you go so seven for all of you enjoy your stay if you have any questions requirements issues or anything anything at all you let me know we can provide okay he gives you your keys leads you to you guys'-- the rooms are clustered in fours like a little square they are all adjacent next to each other in groups of four so there is two sections you guys are given in square formation with small pathways but all the walkways all the alleys between these all just lead right out onto the beach there are no solid walls on any of the hallways here it's just the rooms that are closed off everything just goes-- you just step off into the sand all right so anything you guys wish to accomplish specifically while you're here (laughs) that's great (laughter) i think i know what it is all right so as you guys shed your armor shed your weapons put on your beach-faring clothing you all one-after-one begin to charge your way down to the white beach sands of the bay of gifts just outside of the city itself (laughs) no but you're welcome to start one do you wait until she gets to the water before you do that you arc a good 15 feet before you go face-down in the sand all right all right so (laughter) through the elements of-- which by the way we're all discovering here now all the various relaxation elements of magic in d&d (laughter) (laughs) you guys manage to explore the majority of-- over this journey and multiple trips-- explore a lot of the underwater portion of the bay of gifts which includes a number of wrecked ships that have just been storms this is a very very prominent bay you do run into other individuals that are actually either scavengers or pearl-divers or people that deal with gathering kelp and various other forms of plant life off the ground for food or other purposes it's a very thriving ecosystem here the people that live within this bay utilize everything in the vicinity you see that work here it's quite fascinating and you see all walks of life you all are pale as fuck by comparison to the locals here who live in the sun most of their life but everyone there is friendly you're little white-ass beacons underwater there are no mermaids in this bay that you find sorry all right each of you who wants to go pearl-diving make an investigation check you have no luck under the water but you do find a couple of shark teeth-- at least they look like shark teeth-- along the sands of the beach that have washed up on the shore you don't what did you roll again 21 okay you do manage to find one pearl it's small but it's pretty you manage to find a pretty decent pearl you're not entirely certain-- make an intelligence check you've burned it on lesser 13 okay you gather the pearl you gathered is worth 150 gold there you go you and percival both find similar pearls imperfect maybe worth ten to 15 gold and you rolled a five you found a sea cucumber not that type it doesn't seem to have any sort of defense mechanism it sits there sadly in her grasp it's not like a pulsing tumor or anything it's a dark spot that looks like a bruise that never quite went away what you don't notice is another traveling couple that's lying on the beach about 15 to 20 feet away are now completely buried in sand with their drinks you step in doty watches you get inside not really having an opinion on this all of you guys are beach-dressed except for tary sand's gotten all in the metal joints and the inside of the armor taryon puts you down tary it should have been tary good catch he pulls off the breastplate starts taking off the armor pieces you are now currently down to your skivvies are you trained in sand castle building yeah and some of those tools may come in handy you know what i'm going to do on this yeah we're making rolls for sand castles for this we'll have a skill test for you because you are a brute strength individual this is going to be a dexterity check and you're following his plan all right from the dwendalian empire truscan area i misspoke in an earlier episode the dwendalian empire of king bertrand dwendal exactly yeah so make your dexterity check taryon go ahead and make your history check great you get the structure built you map out the right scale structure of this castle and you get about three-quarters of the way through before grog (shifting sand) tary (impact sounds) he walks over about ten feet all right now make an intelligence check to lay out the design just straight intelligence that's still good it's not a very hard dc you're structuring a sandcastle (laughter) this one's bigger this one's coming along great you're glad the first one fell over because now this is going to be much better (sliding sand) make a perception check you see the opportunity make a sleight-of-hand check a gentle pass by choosing the right moment in which grog is involved in rage-burying and taryon has completely given up on his activities you manage to scoot through the sand and moving your hand behind you to hide the trail you drag his armor off back towards the resort all righty as you've been buried now sufficiently-- up to the neck you feel the sunburn is starting to kick in a bit tary tary tary (impact noise) make a survival check because you're now tracking ten you spend the next hour asking from person to person on these white sands a lot of people do this bay in particular because this bay is a bastion of trade exactly yeah it's a swiss drop area it's great but while everyone here for the most part speaks marquesian a majority speaks some level of common there were probably a couple but they probably understood him they just didn't respond eventually you find your way to the resort you're tired and you're sunburned and you're exhausted you walk out and see him in this state which is what i'm about to get to make a deception check deception 20 okay it takes a little bit of convincing but eventually he sends one of the employees to go along with you they let you into the room okay so as you guys come in at the close of the day-- you've been here for a few days as part of your excursion here-- you all come in as you've had enough time in the sun and you probably need to get out for a little bit all right are you in your room currently no answer it's locked opens up quick glance inside and there's sand scattered all across the ground and in the far end right next to the bed haphazardly jammed underneath you see your armor and belongings (laughter) of yours of percival's that would be-- because you didn't bring everything yeah so pretty much all of percival and vex's belongings are within the room tary yeah all right as you pull the patch and throw it in the room it glows a bright orange and then flashes and burns into two small coal-like embers that when they slam into the ground crack and open and from those two embers you see two full-grown mastiffs (barking and snorting) they both start eating they go nuts on the place one of them goes (sniffs) and just pisses on one of the sacks you're not quite sure which one it is do you leave them in the room you leave and close the door behind you okay all right so you guys meet up again you get more drinks you begin to wander the city is there anything else you want to do while you're out and about for the afternoon all righty all right you guys ask around about a half an hour or so and you're led to one location that is windowless and has an open archway door with some fine purple and red silks blocking the entry as you walk inside there's one woman who's sitting there in the process of eating a small bowl of fruit you see she is a dark-skinned marquesian but elf lineage she has elven features her hair which is this dirty brown is braided in rows that go down past her waist and have a series of multi-colored looks almost like gems and rings and other cool pieces of jewelry that are woven into it as she's looking at this small book in her lap and eating the fruit she turns around oh i'm sorry hello oh the beard i can do that yes of course closes her book and sets it down come sit she calls out in marquesian for a moment and a younger woman probably about 15 or so comes out human dark-skinned as well both begin to start working on your hair and your beard asking about where you're from it becomes a conversational piece because you're there for a good hour and a half or so to go through all of your hair and get it done but nevertheless you now have a fantastic series of braids in your hair all of it if you want more than what i have in mine-- oh you wish to color no it's okay she talks to her assistant and the young girl runs off for a second with a smile comes back and there is what looks to be some sort of a fruit looks like a blue pomegranate that's partially crushed she takes it and with a mortar and pestle setup begins mashing it and goes we can do blue the whole endeavor between the two of you guys is not inexpensive-- few things are in the bay of gifts it's designed specifically to survive and thrive on the trade here both of you guys it costs about 120 gold oh for the two for any sort of masculine hair endeavors which is not our specialty-- well the beads themselves are made from finely blown glass and they're individually colored and those are made specifically by an artisan who is about three blocks up that way so those are brought here and those are purchased on our end as well you are paying straight cost of the beads time and training of course on our end and we do the finest work you'll find all across marquet the 20 is mainly for him the 100 was to give you the dye coloring-- it's still a lot but since you've gotten here you get the sense that it's-- by nature everything here costs a little more a lot of it's imported and a lot of it is designed for people that are willing to pay for foreign goods very well so how much blue did you want to get in your hair how much blue did you want to get in your hair okay all right all right okay so upon completion-- it's very cool it's pretty close to what you were hoping and expecting you end up with three streaks one central one that goes from the center and then two that go from the sides and back that way and then all the tips go to blue so it's almost like you have these two blocks of white and then eventually it all goes blue towards the edge ashley and so yeah anything else you want to accomplish or call it an evening you guys all find your way back with some drinks the sun has set now the cold night has come in through the bay but it's still warm it's cold by the bay standards but you guys come from the northern ends in tal'dorei proper it's still a pretty warm night you hear the waves crashing as you enter the establishment you all head back to your rooms to get in more evening attire percival and vex-- how long do the hounds last for i am so excited i am so excited okay so as soon as you approach you guys hear through the door on the other side this low growl this (growls) okay you come inside to notice the entire interior of the room has been sundered pillows and cloth torn and pulled everywhere the room smells immediately of heaping piles of dog shit and urine the bed is scattered and torn open the curtains have been pulled down and there in the center of the room are two massive mastiffs mating (laughter) okay (laughs) okay your door is open grog you're just there sitting down for a second just grabbing your jug getting a quick nip before your next nip and vex just storms in heaving mad percival as you catch up-- she comes around the corner just dragging grog by the beard behind her the dogs have stopped mating at this point and one of them comes over and goes (sniffs chomp) and just bites into your neck it does nothing it just rests there your stuff isn't-- yeah you didn't just leave your stuff on the floor there you had things put away inside the cabinets and stuff and the things that were in the cabinets were fine so most of your general clothing is all right it's more like your sacks anything that was just loose your boots all just smell of dog piss they do have a lick big old mastiff tongues okay as you rush off to the front counter you can see guath the marquesian is still there he's in the process of going through the books making sure he's keeping everything tidy and he sees you approach ah hello is there anything of-- hello uh yes yes there was-- the other who looks like you he came by and said that he was supposed to put the-- we had to send-- (laughter) he said he had to put things in the room for you i am so sorry i am so sorry if this is a problem we can call the-- you wish us to call the guards over here yeah make an insight check that's the second luck yeah you can see he's covering up you don't quite know the full specifics but you know he's covering at this point she's pulled you out into the hallway you now see the bear you've grown up with and loved for the first time you realize how massive and scary this bear could be as it (growls heavy steps) trinket charges you so what are you doing trinket's coming at you all right okay so hold on she does have your hair technically it's a grapple it's athletics and acrobatics versus her-- i'll double-check real fast i should remember this but for this one particularly i want to make sure that i get specifics right here yeah man this is the craziest shit (laughs) i didn't expect it to go this way not all this this went in a whole different direction okay yeah it's athletics or acrobatics versus her athletics go ahead and roll your acrobatics roll your athletics you slip out from her grasp right as trinket comes upon you what's your speed you don't have your boots on you just put your pants on you mimicked putting your pants on okay trinket's movement is trinket is gaining on you (laughter) there are small baskets yeah so you knock some baskets behind you and you keep running you just emerge from the edge of the hallway you can see the beach ahead of you you can see the little bit of moonlight hitting the sand in front hallways and doors i'd say you moved one direction trinket went and chased him down the other side so this is going away from you guys just as you emerge to part of the sand and you think you're home free you stop hearing trinket's footfalls (whack) leapt and just impacts you on the sand and both of you tumble end-over-end through the sand eventually you land flat on your back and trinket pounces on top of you your breath (groans) as your chest gets closed in and right up in your face pinning you down going (growls) (growls) (laughter) trinket's head slowly turns over back towards you with a what as you walk away trinket's head moves back to you and if you could see a bear smile trinket goes (grunts) and you feel your lower regions get warmer (groaning and laughter) all right while you're pinned there you march off you guys just now catch up to the chaos keyleth's currently getting the mastiffs out of the room yeah animal handling no so you say come here boys they both look at you they rush up grab the jerky out of your hands and dart out of the room you hear them (barks) vanishing taryon (sings) tary tary tary it's all the same it's all horribly mechanical-sounding and echo-y it's not singing more than it's repeating your name over and over again in the same intonation it's horrifying that is prestidigitation you know what yes i'll let you do that i will let you control urine after completing your aramente after years of training in the druidic arts and becoming the leader of your people you are reduced to lifting the urine from a ruined hotel room okay the room's still destroyed for the sake of brevity here-- who's talking to the manager about this all right so at this point while all this has happened guath the gentleman at the front sees the bear and is like what is going-- (yelps) the dogs go (barks) and jump past him the slightly chubby halfling comes forward what the fuck is going on no you tell me this is my place whose dogs were those make a deception check you know whose they are you've been hearing it over the earring this whole time that's true persuasion he goes (sighs) let me see he pulls past and makes his way towards the room and looks inside and you can see him go (distressed noise) no i've never seen those dogs here before the breed they don't exist (laughter) (exclaims in a foreign language) it's still torn and messed up but it's not covered in urine it still smells terrible in there i'm so sorry we'll get you a new room immediately hey two servants come out immediately he starts shouting out to them in marquesian they walk off and eventually people start coming in and pulling your stuff out of the room and taking it to another chamber it's down two halls over so you guys are separated from everybody else oh it is okay we will launch an investigation immediately so (laughs) vex anything else you want to do you hear through the doorway this really creepy tary tary yeah he just walks past you (laughter) your things are being brought out in pieces but the two employees see doty enter and set them down and doty starts picking things up and dusts them off starts picking up the piles of dog feces he's throwing the dung out onto the beach starts heading back okay over the course of the evening the room gets cleaned as best as it can you guys from that point being the most contentious but you manage to enjoy the rest of your stay here in the bay of gifts you enjoy a nice well-earned vacation some of you plotting the next stage in your vengeance whenever that may occur boarding your

have been travelling across the silvercut roadway through the dividing plains of tal'dorei onwards to the alabaster sierras and eventually to the homestead of whitestone you guys have made your way back (laughs) so you arrive what do you want to do so you guys all get settled and you find your way to your rooms the afternoon comes to a close for the evening and everyone's gone off to do their business and prepare for a dinner we'll say in about an hour all right make an arcana check (gasping) but what's your skill what's your skill bonus okay you take the small sack that contains the cards and you pull the deck out of it and you inspect it from the outside just checking the inscriptions you've heard things about magical decks of cards sometimes they're used to see the future sometimes they're used for different types of augury and divination you might've heard a myth or two about a card deck that can alter reality in good and bad ways that's as much as you are able to glean from this no but you do know from looking at this while the name doesn't come to you you're able to ascertain this seems to be very very in line with the fate-altering deck of cards the one you've heard can do good and bad and is as powerful and dangerous as it is interesting all right did you-- do you want me to flip a coin for you it's up to you guys this is entirely your call i know we'll say for the point of the narrative a couple of weeks go by relatively unimpactful yeah the teleportation circle is complete yeah sure so you walk on down to the center of whitestone which is now far more full of life and bustling a lot of the buildings that line the square have little flower boxes underneath the windows color has returned to it still keeps moody gray skies a large portion of the day but overall the city itself seems to have sprung into life over the past year or so the sun tree is beautiful it's still a vastly bark-visible tree it has that orange-brown color across it smooth in most places a little more textured toward the bottom but you see the very lush green leaves up into the boughs you can see little bits of white flowers that year-round reside up in the top it stands there before you in all of its magnificence hey keyleth it's been a while thanks i've been eating right as much as i can you know i'm a tree i mean yeah there's kids and stuff yeah no no it's uncomfortable yeah would you have to nail it into me it's fine but thank you i appreciate the offer appreciate it you're great nah glad the snowing stopped it's hard to keep these blossoms up through the winter let me tell you yeah how are you doing kiki if i could blush (laughter) don't point it out it's embarrassing so hi i'm glad you brought that up i didn't want to breach the subject no i'm cool hang up i don't know either partway into the day we'll say that you've been doing this the bakery's been going fine which actually pike and vex you've been in the process of-- have you guys hired employees to run the bakery are you more playing as managers as opposed to actual workers pike on this day you've been keeping tabs on this a couple of the pale guard approach the bakery one of them without seeing you walks in and goes we're looking for pike is miss pike in could you please come with us there's somebody on the border requesting your presence on the outskirts of whitestone someone who says they know you you'd better come with us the two guards step back and-- do you walk with them it's just her at the moment make a perception check okay as you're walking away from the sun tree and begin heading back to the northern side of whitestone glancing back at him oh it's good to talk to him again and you see pike walking with two guards just on the southwestern side of the square she looks a little nervous there are two kids off to the side that were just playing who look over and go whoa i want to do that they did not see that so as you're brought to the western road it leads you alongside the shops and one of the guard who's talking to you is like yeah sorry a group of folks have been here for a couple of days asking-- a few hours i should say not a couple of days asking about you we've kept an eye on them they don't seem to be aggressive but they asked for you recently and we managed to find you by the bakery here they are they lead you to the outside of the town and there you see a small carriage with two horses that are currently hitched up front you see about three other pale guard in full armor one of them is in the middle of conversation with a couple of figures you see four figures you see three and then a fourth one emerges from inside the carriage it's a topped carriage with what looks to be some sort of curtains that are closed-- reds and dark purples it doesn't look like an elaborate carriage but it's functional you see a male gnome with short dark hair slicked to one side and a well-groomed mustache that curls at the end he's in the middle of talking when he glances over and sees you and goes aha she's here he leaps off the top and the guards get defensive as he goes astra ogden jb she's here then he goes rushing off in your direction as the guards are like sir sir he ignores them for a second and the two guards with you say miss pike should we and they go for their blades he approaches real fast and goes (laughs) and gives a big old hug and lifts you off the ground and it takes you a minute to realize this is johann trickfoot your cousin who you haven't seen in quite a long time he's dressed in a fine vest that is a dark maroon color with a gold trim a little ragged at the edges but fine big swishy pants and boots and he lifts you up for a second and then sets you back down and is like it's been quite a while well we got your letter and we've been hearing all about you-- at least jb's been telling us all about you hasn't she and he looks around and you see the other figures as they approach there's a female gnome older than you who you haven't met before who has curly strawberry-blonde hair that goes just past her shoulders she's wearing this very revealing shirt and seems to walk with a confidence and smile and she goes pike my dear i've heard all about you and she rushes up and gives you a big hug as well you look back and stepping off the carriage you see a very old gnome who is just a wreath of black and salt-and-pepper hair crazy around him like a lion's mane and a giant beard you wouldn't see a face if not for these small spectacles and a little button nose poking out as he's being helped off the wagon by another female gnome that you recognize as she turns around towards you she has long straight black hair that goes right past her shoulders she has a wednesday addams vibe to her she looks back at you and smiles and you can see this gap in her front teeth she's about your age this is jb trickfoot she is the-- jb she's another one of your cousins one that you grew up with actually when you were very young but you haven't seen her in a very long time as they all begin to approach this small cluster of trickfoots have approached as jb walks up to answer johann says yes indeed we've heard all about you i've been so proud to hear that you've done such great good in the world cousin far too long yes johann claps his arm on the side of your shoulder yes of course it's been-- i can't even remember look at how big you are last i saw you you were waist-high to a knuckle-punch it's been far too long and so strong he's slapping the side of your arm and they're all doing the whole family gathering pulling and tugging and you're starting to feel uncomfortable from all the attention and the guards are all confused but also mildly amused by this family gathering the old one now catches up and you recognize that this is your uncle ogden trickfoot who is the father to both johann and jb as he approaches he has this small walking cane and he's walking at an angle because he doesn't quite see you he's like are you sure that she's around huh ah yes i'm all right it's so good to see you there you are he adjusts his head a little they tell me that you slay dragons what what did she say jb's like she said yes she's slayed dragons what she says a bakery cake suddenly you see his face brighten between the bursts of facial and head hair you see a little bit of rosy cheeks poke through with a smile jb goes we'll get you cake we'll get you a cake uncle at which point the blonde one goes yes of course we did you are as beautiful as everything they told me i'm astra by the way i'm johann's wife we haven't met but you are a sight to see she takes your hands and pulls your hands and goes oh my and aren't you the strapping young lady who's the lucky man oh shouldn't be a problem or woman whatever i don't know you can tell me later jb's smile creeps and you see the gap in her teeth once more are these friends vox machina at which point they all look at her and she goes i'm so excited please and they all gather around you and the guard comes up real fast miss do you require assistance very well and the three guards that were at the front shout out the carriage and johann goes oh yes well it's now under the watch of one pike trickfoot so just put it wherever the royal horses go (chuckles) of course you're a busy woman don't worry about it astra fluffs her hair a bit besides i can have a guard escort me any day the guard just grabs her arm and starts walking along with her you can already tell she's a bubbly flirt as you're having this conversation (thudding sounds) yeah they've been having this conversation with them just standing in the square not far from the slayer's cake it'll never get old yeah so you've caught up at this point percy you've just started to see them in the distance taryon i don't know if you're-- okay so while you guys are having this conversation taryon you hear what sounds like ruckus laughter conversation voices overlapping getting louder and louder and then suddenly the front door to the slayer's cake which has been quiet this afternoon (thud) and then (laughs) oh this place is amazing do you smell that you smell that uncle and you watch as the uncle comes in (sniffs) smells like rocks he lost his smell when he was very-- it was a terrible accident horse hoof in the face anyway hi we're family of pike trickfoot and we were told to come here and try your wares so this is a bakery she wasn't always blonde you know yeah i guess she wanted a change of pace she had dark hair when she was younger astra free treats and they start grabbing and filling their pockets with blondies and eating them in between you watch as jb walks up with long dark hair and goes do you happen to have any water tary grabs and gets a small bucket of water and sets it down you watch as jb begins breaking up the pastry and dipping it in the water and then feeding it to the uncle occasionally has to right his face and it's getting caught in the beard a little bit well (chuckles) she-- at that point the door bursts open and the rest of you arrive there at the slayer's cake we did your friend here-- taryon darrington who apparently speaks gnomish-- look at you keeping your culture was nice enough to give us the run of the house (chuckles) oh my dear that's not possible johann trickfoot random tasker at your service he bows the woman with the curls says astra trickfoot this here's my lumpy husband elbows him in the side and also at your service and glances over and does a quick scan of everybody and falls on you and gives you a wink jb who is currently feeding the older uncle ogden trickfoot goes i'm jb i'm the cousin who grew up with her the most she's my favorite at which point she's been so concentrated on this she doesn't realize she's been mashing the food into the side of ogden's cheek (babbling) i'm sorry she wipes him down astra goes well we travel a lot and we've heard of exploits in various towns all around i just have not had the chance to meet pike after all the stories i've heard and johann speaks of her often and jb is pretty much obsessed with your exploits jb's over there i've been keeping tabs so we were surprised that we were located by a courier who gave us your letter and your absolutely unnecessary but very appreciated donation to the family and we thought it would be nice and right of us to come and thank you in person johann and astra turn their heads to jb and jb goes well i'm keeping tabs on what you've been doing there had been word that you not only helped with the reconstruction of emon but you've also been traveling to and from whitestone since the conclave attacked the continent so we narrowed it down between a few possibilities and based on the fact that you percival-- this is your city is that correct we figured that given that basis we had a good chance we passed through westruun and could not find you wilhand however did say that you're doing well and we eventually made our way east and here we are it's good to see you you're grog strongjaw yes you're the one that apparently replaced me you grew up together once we were not and you're a strong half-giant of a man the beard confuses me but you've done many great things i suppose the rest of you it is an honor to meet you i've heard so much and it's rare you get to meet heroes in your lifetime (shouting) what i'm still hungry johann pops up and goes we're always passing through my dear but we figured we'd just stay for a few days however long it takes to get to know you a little better and then we'll be on our way we could stay weeks if you'd like we've been traveling we're very tired insight you can't-- you have to make an individual insight check okay they're hard to read in general they're strange they're interesting they're unique but they seem to be jovial and full of personality you get a very familiar vibe as you did with dr dranzel's troupe from they look at each other johann and then astra rushes in they both give you a hug and then astra goes uncle ogden she grabs ogden and (yelps) comes over and i'm confused he's being held against you really and you watch as jb approaches and pats you of course she follows you out there you look so pretty you've done so many good things i've heard so many good things it's so good to see you well i've been watching ogden traveling and seeing the sights of the countrysides of tal'dorei it's life on the road she looks around and goes well we haven't heard from your immediate side of the family since your bastard father left for wynandia across the sea good riddance no offense that was a long time ago i was young but no seriously you're not missing much with them go for it 13 she seems guarded and hard to read but legit she lights up and goes yes i've heard of him is he around oh okay but i've heard of him i've heard of his exploits (chuckles) as i've asked around he's left quite a trail of ladies through the years they have a lot to say about him bit of a scoundrel that one of course i'm glad we had this bonding time you want to come right she grabs your arms and tugs a little bit you get a very faint sense of mild arrested development that makes you a little uncomfortable she walks inside with you with her arm on your shoulder and as you come back inside the hug seems to have pulled away from grog for a second but the laughter is billowing from the room and johann at this point is mid-story to grog and that's the craziest thing she was so small but could yet poop so much it's incredible if we could have painted a picture you wouldn't know where she put it away but that's another story of course days weeks was invited here of course but-- astra steps forward and takes your hand and she goes it's all right dear we're not going to stay longer to make it uncomfortable i'm sorry about these folks i married into the trickfoots i'm not bound to the same ridiculousness as these guys so don't worry sure 20 total that sounds fantastic it's so happy to have the trickfoots together again so where are we all staying fantastic wondrous show us along we have things to unload wonderful i love it i love it as you're saying this uncle ogden has stepped forward again and jb is like uncle ogden he (grunts) and reaches out and finds the edge of your cheek and chin and he drops his cane pulls his glasses off and you see these tiny dark beady eyes between the wrinkles and he goes pike it's so good to see you thank you you're a good one he puts his glasses back on and reaches out and jb picks up a stick and hands it to him he's like thank you you want to make an insight check (laughter) you genuinely feel bad for even having that second thought (laughter) his head spins for a second he smiles and in gnomish back to you he says oh it's been a while oh you watch as johann spits out the pastry always hungry is that how you got your pastries well we're not hunters so i guess we'll stay here until you finish hunting you know we're not hunters we've never been hunters trickfoots don't hunt not a bad idea i could use a bath actually how about you astra astra's like oh i'd love a bath right now i've been on the road for so long and jb goes uncle could really use a bath very well show us along not coming with us the trickfoots tend to scatter on their own yeah sure we'll go with that one yeah not everyone can be trusted in the family it's frustrating the people that you care for and spend your life hitting behind betray that trust and good riddance to them they all look back at jb who lights up again and goes everything jb is like well i-- and johann goes i feel like if we don't choose him we're going to get squashed (laughter) mr strongjaw you may show us around great great now to the baths how big are your baths are they huge are they human-sized baths are they bigger than human-sized baths you all right so you show them up to the castle which i assume is where you're letting them stay right okay that information is easily distributed throughout the pale guard without issue because there are only within the castle at any given time four baths four rooms that contain full baths occasionally you have to wait for a person but they immediately scatter three of them are taken you wait a while eventually they one by one start making their way down to the main banquet hall of the castle cleaned up you watch as johann comes down wearing his same clothing that appears to have been cleaned wow i'm appreciative that you have servants here that can do such a nice job with such fine family threads his mustache is done perfectly his hair is still slick and wet from the bath combed over well thank you it's in the blood he turns around astra what's taking her so long walks back out to the stairway and rushes past the guards his little gnomish head dodging by their knees almost he goes (shouting) astra you hear a voice go (shouting) i'm almost done wait and be patient he goes back she'll be down in a moment don't worry in the meantime is there an appetizer course you're so generous he pinches your cheek he waltzes over to the table sits down and grabs the fork and knife two bottles of red and ooh what vintage have you he begins talking with the servants about what various wines are available okay the servants that are there the whole waitstaff and kitchen staff go of course milady a curious request but one we will fulfill to our greatest ability the staff stops and goes friend taryon i'm sorry but the lady requested specifically that the meal not be-- lady vex'ahlia make a persuasion check you're asking them to override the word of the lady of the house sam one (laughter) the lady you're speaking about persuasion he goes but if you say it's the word of lady vex'ahlia-- i'm so confused we'll do our best holy shit you see this internal struggle everyone fine meat's back on the menu sorry and the staff goes (groans) and starts throwing shit out that they were halfway working on and starting from scratch the servants all stop and go (sighs) yes grand poobah (laughter) it burns it burns so good as you guys all find yourselves ready the trickfoots also begin to fill in to the banquet hall the servants provide a fantastic spread of heartily cooked pork meats peanut butter fresh from the jar piles of cheeses johann gives a curious eye and goes well who are we to scoff at the cultures of others let's dig in everyone and immediately he goes in astra begins eating as well jb takes a bite and then prepares a bite for uncle ogden who is in the process of staring at the table strangely eventually the spoon finds its way there as this is happening johann begins asking questions so this is your castle jb is like no it's not her castle it's his castle she's just staying here for now at which point cassandra comes in from the back arms crossed she wanders in brother everything all right brother very well i'll be in my chambers if you require anything i'm fine i'm a bit tired it's been a long night but whoever you are welcome to whitestone she looks back to percival ah i would love to welcome you all to whitestone you are guests of ours if you are guests of hers we'll talk later she makes her way back up the stairs you watch as trish who's her bodyguard on this shift follows her up she's one of two shift personal guards of cassandra okay you we have so much to catch up on it's been a long time she looks around there's this long awkward pause as she keeps looking over vox machina again and again but not making any eye contact with grog and eventually goes i suppose lady vex'ahlia hands the spoon over to you should i just go sit okay she gets up from the table johann's still talking he's telling stories we trickfoots for generations we've been problem-solvers we rove from place to place solving problems across the countrysides if you have a squeaky wheel we fix the wheel if you have a squeaky door we fix the door if you have a squeaky tax man we fix the tax man that's a joke that's a joke you can laugh see there you are as this conversation's happening there's a small bowl of what looks to be some of the pork but it's been soaked in some water or wine and it's been mashed or pre-chewed you're not quite sure but you have the spoon there and you have uncle ogden sitting there going-- his ear perks up a little bit and he goes i haven't heard that talk in a long time his head turns slightly towards you but he's still looking off a little bit from under the glasses it would be considered undercommon do you understand undercommon okay then yeah he looks back and goes it's been travel they take care of me we're here now his hand reaches over and grabs your hand and holds it for a second he goes we're here now to protect you from the curse i've been having visions of you an angel of light swallowed by dark they come often and the dreams that come often generally come to pass there is a curse in our blood and we wish to save you from that curse his fingers tighten a little bit on your hand not in a painful way but an emphatic hold i'm worried for you you're the only good one his hand releases your hand he drools a little bit and wipes it with his hand (laughter) it dribbles out a little bit unexpected it's good you see him smiling now astra met johann about ten years ago he needed someone to nail him down spry wily prone to terrible choices he's a stupid boy stupid stupid boy at which point johann who's been talking stops and goes in undercommon i can hear you dad anyway she's good to him if she breaks his heart i'll kill her they absconded east and got in a little trouble it's just like my brother to do that he's the one who held the stupid gene on our generation i'm tired now at which point jb who's been over there talking with you and asking questions about the castle and what accommodations there are sees uncle ogden get up oh uncle i'll help you i'm so sorry lady vex'ahlia she stands up and walks around and grabs the elbow uncle ogden are you tired he's very fragile if you'd trust anyone to take him it's what i'm used to but if lady vex'ahlia-- at which point as soon as you say that she smiles brightly and goes actually yes she sits down next to you and begins asking about i can't believe that you stepped into the same ridiculousness that wilhand did and it's brought you all this we just thought he was an old coot it's all right we make ourselves scarce on purpose we've been helping out but mostly me yeah you can see that she stiffens up a little bit so he's already told you i don't want to ruin an evening that's going so well but he's had visions i'm worried about you when we got your letter that-- we didn't know how to find you we didn't think that you were in the area when your letter found us we thought maybe you weren't that far away so we began to search our way along the silver cut yeah go for it she's hard to read in general even when she was a kid she was an odd duck she seems genuine you see astra who's been drinking deep of one of the two fine bottles of red wine is drunkenly leaning with her arm around johann's arm he's a little tipsy but he's still in conversation talking to grog he's telling embarrassing story after embarrassing story and since you're so eager and no one else really wants to pay him as much mind he's talking to the table but he's mainly focusing on you as you begin helping ogden who as you grab his arm he's shaking and he has his cane as he moves along his skin is very loose i can walk under my own power at the stairs he's still looking off as soon as you get to the stairs he gets about two steps and has to stop and breathe and another two stairs he leans into it and you eventually help him up the staircase that spirals up to the second floor and eventually lead him to his chambers always by nature we don't really put down roots big old smile as he says roots darkened some broken teeth heinous smell yep yes dreams terrible premonitions at this point he stops and looks up towards you as you're holding his arm and he reaches up and pulls the glasses shakily from the front of his face and through his small dark brown beady eyes you see the whites at the sides are bloodshot he glances up and goes the kinds of dreams that end a bloodline we're trying to find a way to stop it good then we came at the right time go for it if you can get me to the edge of it i can manage good she can use some family dark tidings indeed (raspy grunt) he gets up and leans the stick off to the side and it (thudding noise) onto the ground that's all right i can get that he leans back and lets you do it there's a legend in the trickfoots every generation one is born with the blood curse one that carries with it the anger of someone slighted when we first became trickfoots maybe it's superstition but every one of these individuals died a horrible painful death screaming of a shadow that came for them it's a myth i know but these dreams are real and i'd rather be careful and wrong than careless and right shapeless dark eyes like burning coals shapeless black shadow with red eyes sounds similar but orthax was generally black smoke had form and the eyes were more of a yellow months only once i was very young my brother theobold i don't know this whole family is paranoid and guards their secrets from each other anyway make a perception check as you've been paying attention to them most of dinner mannerisms everything there are some similarities yeah they're not direct family they're cousins uncle-- they're once removed from her central nuclear family but you do see similarities in cheekbone structure at least with johann ogden and jb moreso with jb it's hard with the mustache with johann but there are some similarities between jb and pike and you can't help but envision these two cute little gnome children playing together these two dark-haired female gnomes running around and there may have been an age when they could have been hard to tell apart from each other as johann picks up astra anyway it's been a fantastic meal i appreciate your hospitality and i look forward to this grand tour you promised tomorrow oh i've got loads okay as you say this to her she glances back and says very well under the needs of being upfront as well i want you to know that i'm not interested (laughter) i don't think he has either no she looks over at grog and goes perhaps a tour is in order but just no i'm not interested in the tour yes she gets up and walks away good night everyone good night pike eventually all the gnomes have left and you're all there dumbfounded at the dinner table you guys scan through pat yourselves down everything's in place you haven't because you haven't been with most of the trickfoots for most of your life you've been with wilhand since you were very young you said six he's not been eager to talk about the family you can see he resents the trickfoot clan so you haven't heard of this but you also know very little about them he's in westruun right now it is also late in the evening yeah wilhand is older than ogden ogden looks like he's older but his physicality is not based on age as much as it's based on-- something akin to that i guess you'd say yeah i'm excited for this so as you all eventually find yourselves resting for the evening contemplating the plans to take first thing in the morning we'll go ahead and close tonight's episode there we'll pick this up next week we'll stall if we need to we'll make it happen all righty guys well thank you so much for watching tonight i hope you enjoyed it as much as we did we'll be back here next thursday 7pm pacific as usual until then have a wonderful weekend and is it thursday yet good night guys
