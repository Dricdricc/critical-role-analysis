in to tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] korshad yes 230000 gold debt lydia was who you are to be betrothed to and the location was the grumpy lily had a stroke while taking notes in d&d grumpy lily make a retroactive perception check rightly so what well if you are looking for maryanne she's probably in her chambers well it was just dark and cold and empty no no there's furniture and a lot of the furniture here is really well made dark woods fine deep red and maroon fabrics a lot of it has dust on it no plastic covers but some of the furniture here is for use and some of it is here just as part of the decor and it's very easy to see which ones are which okay they're really uncomfortable you leave a little butt-print in the dust perfect at which point bertholt acknowledges that you guys will be staying could i get anything for you perhaps teas juice water i'll fetch the wine and he hobbles off to acquire some means of imbibement okay you make your way back to the second floor and off to the far western end of the estate to what you recall being maryanne's chambers so as you enter her room which has become her own study as you recall last time seeing her her room was becoming more and more of a functional office and as you knock and push the door open like a familiar brother does not wishing for any patience on her end necessarily you can see the interiors the bed's there for function most if it is i wouldn't say a replica but it very much resembles the decor and mood of your father's study you see her currently sitting at a desk in the corner her blonde hair is tied back in a tied braid that runs down her back she wears a coat and pants and seems to be dressed a little formally or businesslike for being casually at home you haven't really seen her dress like this before at least not in a casual circumstance as you glance over past the doorway she looks up from her papers and goes brother brother what-- she closes the book you can see she's been looking over ledgers and catalogues looks like she's been doing a fair amount of work here at the desk and stands up in a very formal way and begins to step towards you when have you arrived kidnapped right no not quite but the responsibilities have definitely been mounting you look well how have the wind-tossed roads of exandria treated you this past year we're on the path to destitution yes probably both to be honest we're in a relatively dire situation compared to our previous long-standing lifestyle choices we're trying to fix this mess well you were part of the plan we're trying to figure this out the best we can and given the circumstances we feel this is probably one of the most viable and least dangerous or risky endeavors in which we can right the family's trajectory oh you're welcome to meet her i've met her i helped to arrange this she's very nice she's very pretty a bit bookish which once again would befit you rather well but let's be honest this is a political marriage you do what you want i mean there isn't a politician or a lord of this land that hasn't in some way shape or form made their own life outside of the family at that point you noticed she gets a bit dark and seems to speak with this bit of sarcasm there's been no necessary change to the way business has been done other than the transition of some responsibilities of course and she gives a slight nod she's getting a little uncomfortable as this conversation continues marrying into this family the truscan lot would enable us the resources and connections to reacquire the deeds to our land to reacquire the business elements that we've been in this unnecessary partnership with for some time and would enable us to once again reclaim complete rulership of our family-controlled lands it is a partnership that is quickly sliding into the behest of the myriad we still own everything in partnership own solely on our own some of the furniture i have only been recently brought into this unfortunate circumstance brother and you can trust in knowing that in my studies and my time spent here working with father being very clear and very thorough with the mistakes he's made in the past i will not be doomed to repeat them well he's certainly in need of retiring based on the stress he's put upon himself it would not be long until i will take over the responsibilities it's certainly a better challenge than many other daughters of lords are given in their time friends come when the money and power's in place you know this it's the way the land works wonderful as you begin to make any sort of exit she catches you and goes brother your arrival here is a great boon to us you have the power to change the fate of this family consider the respect you have for the people who have worked their entire lives to provide for you what you have been given mother and father sacrificed so much for us consider weighing one's selfish interest versus the importance of a bloodline that is all i ask well it's good to see you she steps forward and gives you a half-hug it's like-- good day she straightens her coat and sits back behind her desk and waits for you to leave as you're exiting the house and berthold's opening the door you hear some heavy creaking from the stair that leads down to the main area and you watch as an older woman in her early fifties or so with her mid-length curly brown hair in shades of gray green eyes behind a small set of reading spectacles stoic of face wearing what looks to be some sort of a finely crafted silk robe clutching a book under her arm comes down the steps and looks down and goes taryon taryon my boy and she sets the book down and walks up puts her hands out as she says oh takes you at the sides of the face and pulls you in for (kisses) oh terribly sorry i didn't realize that we had guests look at you so rugged so you've had some adventures with my boy have you that's wonderful have you spoken with your father i-- and she reaches back and takes the book off the step and goes i've been making my way through your library yes well i've had a lot of time to myself been a bit under the weather for some time and these have kept me fine company well not this piece of trash and she sets it down there's one what was it called the river's dawn it was a brilliant-- before the river's dawn that one yes it was a continuation of the creation myth of wildmount but it turned into the spirits of the gods these two fauns and they fell in love but could not be together because the dawn had to rise and the sun would shine it was very very beautiful very much so it reminded me of you well i didn't break the binding too much i hope all right if you would excuse us for just a moment please just a few moments and she points towards the door berthold is leading you out of the main area out the front door you guys were on your way out as soon as she has some privacy with you she goes my boy if you could indulge me in some strange honesty i'm rather intrigued at this idea i don't wish to undermine anything that we've built as a family i've lived a privileged life for a very long time far longer than you and your sister have i've lived within this house removed from the world i do as responsibility asks of me my wedded duties as both a wife and a mother and i do so without complaint i have always seen you fight these same circumstances bravely and i find vicarious joy in your escape from this place this past year these books are a reminder of that same bravery i know howaardt has said many things and he may be right but there's a little part of me that welcomes a little change in scenery and lifestyle maybe that's what the family needs i don't know perhaps i'm foolhardy i know not looking at you looking at your sister i wouldn't change it for the world one way or another i just-- (sighs) i just want you to make choices for yourself i want you to do what you think is right that you could live with duty and blood is one thing but anyway i'm talking out of turn could you not tell howaardt we've had this conversation i would like that very much good evening as you leave she's like oh the other one i was trying to remember was the mountain range of gold it was a wonderful three-part series-- well the second book you get halfway through it before he even turns and reveals himself and then the white robes and everything his renewed power it's incredible anyway i'm sorry you have your friends waiting on you good night taryon so as you step out to greet the rest of your friends all right who's leading this charge probably you taryon you've never been to this place you've heard of it but you'd never be seen dead in a place like this before you lead your way in at this point because when you arrived the sun was still in the sky but it was deep in the sky so by now it's post-dusk you now see the massive stone and wood structures of deastok are dark against the ever-dark sky with the windows now aglow this warm yellows and orange of the candle and lantern-lit interiors you can see there are hanging lanterns that are put out there and you can see a number of individuals who seem to work for the city who go and place these lanterns up in each of these poles are now finishing their job and are returning to the evening following these lamps along the street the cobblestones are still really well kept for as old as this town seems to be for a city that isn't a major metropolis within a kingdom and what your experience has been in tal'dorei a fair amount of money still makes it way through this city eventually you find your way fairly far north into the city until you come across the exterior of the grumpy lily asking a few questions to guide you to which building it is it's much smaller than you expected you see what appears to be a single-story pub with one window one door no more than maybe 30 feet on any given side it is lit from the inside though it's dimly lit as you approach and push past the somewhat ajar entryway you see before you what appears to be three tables three singular stained brown tables one lone patron sits at the center table an elderly man inspecting a small clay sculpture that he's enraptured by and a single barkeep to your right that seems to notice your entry a healthy pale woman of brunette hair in her forties dressed in a simple gray blouse as soon as you enter and take in the atmosphere she goes slow day folks happy to have the business what can i get you your head does reach the ceiling yes that i can get for you dear don't worry red wine we can do definitely she walks over and slams her hand on the side of the bar and what you thought was once the patron now appears to be the one barman there wait what oh i missed the conversation yeah red wine for our guests oh he stands up and begrudgingly walks over you see his back is hunched forward and he's (pained grunting) leaves the room for a second well sit down find a place wherever you like it's dimly lit so there's plenty of shadows nothing seems amiss it seems like a shitty pub it's the definition of a poorly attended dive you can make an investigation check if you want to you begin to look around the floor and keep perspective around the area no you see some stains you see some crumbs and at one point you look over in the corner and you see what appears to be a piece of stale bread that's been left under one of the tables and there are three rats currently eating it as soon as you lean in they all stop and look at you and scatter (laughs) they just give you the fuck-you look and keep eating their bread the elderly barman walks in now and he's got two bottles of red wine and he's shuffling (grunts clinks) i'll get your cups turns around and starts shuffling back whatever you want the gentleman shuffles back now with a bunch of cups his hands wrung through all the various handles (grunts clicks) (grunts) two gold for both bottles thank you you see him walking and he goes like (sighs) he slowly turns his head over to the bartender the woman what was that what about them (click) she gives a click noise to the old man who goes (groan thump) are you going to take your bottles or what all right pick them up follow me he turns around and shuffles out it's like following a bad slow npc in world of warcraft you're like just go fucking faster his pace is terrible yeah it's awful exactly just waiting eventually he takes you out of the small pub past the unused kitchen which has another series of stale bread clumps on the side down to what looks to be a broom closet he gets there to the edge of the broom closet and pulls out a key ring sure so you walk over to the kitchen and grab some of the bread crumbs and throw them down on the ground and you wait there because there's no rats present and you're like bread crumbs they scatter a little further out you turn around and the minute you turn in the air you hear (skittering) and look over and there's like seven rats that just scurried out of the shadows and are just going at these crumbs immediately he pulls one key and unlocks the small closet you paid attention (creak) opens this rickety wooden door and goes (grunt) and walks past and he's behind the door expectantly waiting you guys glance into the space and you can see there's what looks to be a low torchlight about every ten feet down a wooden stairway that descends about 30 40 feet traps or people hiding perception check investigation check look at that that's disgusting all right so you guys make your way down no traps in the stair descent but you make your way to the bottom of the stairs without issue you don't see anything necessarily fishy you do see these torches have been burning for a little bit a couple hours and are probably needing to be re-upped pretty soon you guys eventually make your way down and as soon as the last of you-- who's following up the rear in this by the way what's the marching order the hallway here is about big enough for you to go single file okay so grog's in the very back keyleth percy yeah pike's with grog so we'll say grog in the back then pike then keyleth then percy then taryon and vex and vax and you have trinket in your necklace i assume okay all right so you guys descend down the stairway as soon as grog you make your way in it's tiny you have to (straining) squeeze in and duck low and even just walking through the pathway your shoulders are rubbing against the sides of the wall and your head occasionally (bang bang) you are a kaiju okay it's ten minutes it takes to do yeah it's ten minutes before you know you're going to go into something you stop and do this the door closes behind grog and you hear it lock this is great by the way because at the bottom of the stairs it only goes for about 15 more feet before there's a door there's a man on a stool who's just sitting there going-- he's not stopping you as you guys are all in the hallway grog at the back you can't move forward because everyone's stopped and you're just like-- (groan) all of you who wish to can take 17 temporary hit points that's by the inspiring leader feat it is your choice as to whether or not you felt inspired by that and take them grog's too uncomfortable to take them that's true yeah that's what grog needs is temporary hit points you see this guy he's tough and surly looks like a balding man who's just like made of muscle and anger he's sitting there with one eye open one a little squinted he's just-- he doesn't seem to respond you do hear like a series of muffled voices and what sounds like a faint beat of some kind from the other side of the wall just muffled he begins to reach over for what looks to be a small lever that's hidden on the side stops (grunts) so as you guys enter this doorway as it pushes open you're immediately hit with a wall of voices and laughter and conversation interweaving in multiple languages this is far more lively than you expected it would be it's a large tavern hall it's almost two stories tall but it's open there's a central circular chandelier that hangs over with what looks to be flickering candles in a circle around it you can see elements of what are almost like a second floor but it's more like a slight balcony outcropping you don't see any doorways it's just a level platform above and there before you you see what has to be three or four dozen people scattered across a number of tables all in various forms of dress and many of them are drinking some of them are playing games of chance some of them are in deep conversation you can see the music-- though this is a bad example but it's what i have-- it's not a full band per se it looks like there's a set of three percussionists in the far corner that are all in the process of weaving this rhythmic beat that shifts and changes some of them are on more of a hand drum some of them are more small percussion instruments it's interesting it's not the usual bar atmosphere you're used to it has almost a weird-- i'd say it's in between the two actually take a little blue man group and a little bit of subway bucket drummer it's right in between there you guys step into the chamber and take in the atmosphere a bit whether that be with smiles awe or confusion and care as soon as you begin having this conversation and taking in the atmosphere one of four bar hands sees you approach you see a jagged smile of a hairless man with ruddy skin that immediately comes up to you aye friends new faces are few and far between here in deastok welcome to our little slice of the family what can i get you i don't know where you got that shit but put that away we'll get you right fucked up eh i'll see what i can muster slim pickings for room here it's a bit early in the evening that's when it's the busiest just find some space sit down folks don't want you to sit by them don't fucking sit by them you see two tables that have room for half of a large group you split between the two tables one of the tables appears to be three guys who are in a card game as soon as you sit down they (grunts) and then keep talking amongst themselves more about taking bets bluffing each other giving shit about their home lives stuff like that the other table has four quiet individuals that are look to be elvish lineage either half-elf or full elf it's hard to tell they're wearing these hoods that show the ears from underneath but then seem to block a lot of the features of their face and guard a lot of the forehead this silk hood that drips down past the nose on the sides make a history check 19 you haven't seen this kind of dress but you've heard of it it seems to be of wildmount but the eastern side of wildmount not a part of the dwendalian empire this more stems from zorhaus which is the other kingdom on the continent it's actually in a tense existence along the border of the dwendalian empire zorhaus i'm pretty sure that's what it's called it is it's whatever it's called in the campaign guide i know i'll just have to look it up again but anyway as soon as you sit down at the table the four individuals look at each other and then get up from the table and then walk off to find another place okay all of you guys can sit at the table now that you've forced them off their own space the guys playing the card game seemed to pay no mind as you sit around the table the barhand that met you here approaches and once more goes all right looks like you've found a place to sit what can i get you got you that shiraz you were asking for eh he goes ahead and he pulls up what looks to be a dark green bottle already uncorked and he brings over a hefty metallic goblet or tankard and then pours it in there it appears to be something akin to a shiraz i suppose fills it to the top slides it forward all right drinks for anyone else eh i can get you a meat pie if that's what you're asking i don't recommend you drink it though you could probably squeeze water from a stone so wouldn't surprise me if you could all right coming on up anyone else it can be done so whiskey and you little one oh i mean no offense lady but you're a bit small-sized-- i mean that respectfully look i'm just looking out for my patrons here i don't want to go ahead and send someone to the local temple all right i'll take your word for it then another shiraz all right coming up and he leaves the table korshad you say all right you want what he likes it's going to cost you more than that thank you very much that'll put you up to yours though we will go ahead and settle your bills at the end of the drinks but all right korshad it is make a perception check well you said you were looking too so roll a perception yeah 30 okay you gather the direction that he glanced it was a cursory look more to see if the individual in question was still in the room or not but you got the direction of it and you know exactly where he was looking-- three tables and that way there he leaves for a bit and the laughter is still rising and falling throughout the room the musicians in the corner which are two younger human boys and what appears to be a female goliath who has the heavier drum in the center who is like the mid-piece the big (heavy drum noises) the two guys one of them has a small set of lap drums (light drum noises) the faster beats and the guy to the left of her-- they could be brothers you're not too sure their features are similar but different enough the ages seem off the guy on the left has a series of small wooden blocks and what looks to be some sort of contraption that has three or four different small percussion instruments that are all fixed to it and so he is leaping between them all for being just percussion that variety is still making a cool melody you're still able to find certain notes and certain blends where it still is a very different and unique atmosphere they manage to bring to this crescendo the piece that you entered on and it finishes there is no real-- there is occasionally a couple of claps here and most everyone is busy about their own shit as they're both looking over to grab a drink to stop and the younger guy with a scruffy chin and this mop of hair that's a little wild glances over to you yeah you're welcome can't say i have sir my apologies sorry you guys ever heard of dr dranzel and the other guy goes nope the goliath woman is sitting there and she is just staring off across the room and goes no (laughter) okay you watch the gentleman who has been getting you guys drinks and he is in the process of getting all of your various drink orders and pouring what you have requested and he does come to a point where he gets this one fine jewel goblet that he has specifically set off to the side and he takes it and washes it and takes care to clean it entirely and dry it off and once it's set there he reaches underneath counting a few bottles and pulls one drink uncorks it and there is this thick dark brown glass jug and as he uncorks it he pours it into there glances over grabs another thing seems to be mixing it with something else he is being very careful with the actual amounts he is pouring he finishes that takes a piece of what looks like an orange crushes it in the inside and leaves the rind and takes it and swishes it for a second (sighs) and walks over to a table across the entire hall where you saw him glance before he walks over to a table where you see what appear to be about five different patrons at the table most of them wealthily dressed two of them appear to be older mercantile or business owners they wear the jewelry on their hands very extravagantly and displaying both wealth and prestige to an ostentatious way that you know most high-end guild workers or owners tend to display you are very familiar with caste systems that have emerged in a lot of these central metropolitan areas and so you can very easily pick up some of those themes two of them appear as a contrast very simply dressed no jewelry you can't make out any details in this distance and there is one man who he hands the drink to he sets it down in front of him and slides it forward the man you see there he has deep brown skin marked there appear to be a number of tattoos that curl up his arms and up the side of his neck and touch his ears on each side he's wearing light billowing clothes of silver and maroon silks that end about the elbow and are just hanging beneath leaving the rest of his arm completely visible where you can see the tattoo continues up the forearm and grasps the back of the hand almost like he has a gauntlet on that is just his skin you see around him a series of gold and silver bracelets and rings that adorn his fingers his face is framed by a lion's mane of black and gray dreadlocked hair because of your perception check at this distance and your ranger-like eyes you can see what you perceive to be a visible scar on his throat from ear to ear he's currently mid-conversation with the patrons at the table leaned back in his chair in a comfortable setting and as soon as the drink-- huh sure well the drink arrives and gets pushed forward and you read the barkeep's lips as he says this drink is a gift to you from patrons on the other side of the place and this individual who you assume at this point is probably korshad gives a look and goes (grunts) and he points over right over to your table across the room you watch as korshad sits up glances over your direction sees you looking at him directly takes the drink scoots it over next to his side and folds his fingers and goes back into listening to the conversation of the other patrons and the barkeep who is standing there is right and then goes back to the bar gathers the rest of your drinks and brings them slowly over to your table and passes them out all right got a second shiraz for you there sir we've got a whiskey and a whiskey we got an ale and a meat pie for you and you well-- (laughs) he brings up these two mugs they're simple ceramic mugs that are dark and handcrafted and he sloshes them up to you and as you see inside most ale has a good liquidy content this has a very syrupy thick texture to it he slides both forward and goes i don't expect you to drink both those back to back and he leans forward and goes this here is the change-bringer's nectar you sip this slowly well you guys are all at the same table now yeah one table got up as soon as you sat down okay it's very thick and it's sweeter than you expected but it has a definite burn that grows and grows after drinking it it's syrupy but because of its syrupy texture as it goes down it also coats and numbs everything as it touches and you get the sense it's probably a good thing it's almost like maple syrup everclear meat pie's pretty good sadly no empanadas in deastok make a religion check it's really not that hard the change-bringer is avandra avandra one of the gods of the pantheon the change-bringer is the deity that looks over luck looks over adventure travel the open road that's as much as you can glean from your passing knowledge of the deity since you are not a woman of faith obviously you don't know much beyond that she's also known as she who makes the path make a perception check okay so as you begin walking in that direction vex couple things one you notice that korshad while he seems to be mostly being talked at or at least just listening to a conversation when he does speak he leans in and does this you get the sense he's a very guarded man and this is not his first rodeo he speaks through his fingers but he doesn't appear to look over at your table again he seems to have acknowledged the drink is enjoying it slowly and is back enthralled by the conversation at his table what did you roll 25 and what did you say you were going to do okay you both cover your mouths vax glancing about the chamber remember i said there was a secondary platform that didn't have any doorways to rooms but there was just the upper walkway across the room both ways there are about six figures on each one they're all sitting there wearing leather armor mostly covered by a cloak you glance up and you can see underneath at least two of the cloaks what appear to be the shape or outline of a crossbow at the ready the music picks up again grog as you're walking over the next piece is occurring and you can see now that while the previous one had a frenetic tribal beat this one has more of a scattered if i could say percussion jazz sense it tends to have multiple changes yeah if you could if you haven't heard the jazz timpani before it's fantastic it's more of an improvisational piece you can see where they're each building off of each other and then one will make a change and the others will shift with it you don't notice this because you really don't care but anybody who had musical interests would be able to pick up on this but you walk up and you see the goliath woman most of the goliath women you've come across their lifestyle leads to either very short-kept or very tightly bound hair as the coarse hair of the goliaths tends to mat up very thickly when living in the wild as your tribe did this goliath female's hair is really well kept actually it's almost shining which catches you off guard entirely she's not tattooed and appears to be in a trance as she's in the process of drumming away not even looking at the two of her compatriots or any patron she's spacing out and is currently enraptured by the music she's creating make a perception check she has very nice boots and as a man who has made boots in the past you can acknowledge those are very well-made boots the head slowly turns and the eyes focus for a second in the dim snow-blind looking pupils and gives you a nod head turns a little to the side (bang) big drum hit and her part of the song comes to a halt the two other bits of music alter but continue the beats and she just-- as you walk back to the group a little dejected vax since you're the one who's paying attention the most at this point you notice as the goliath gets this small grin on the side of her face and continues to go back to the drums but grog doesn't see it all right so what's the next order of business guys about 20 additional minutes go by another round is bought at the table with korshad still slowly very carefully sipping the drink that you guys bought for him doesn't appear to be slowing doesn't appear to be breaking you can keep waiting if you want one of the korshad drinks okay do you go to the bar you haven't asked him yet no there are a few barhands that walk around but the one you've been going with you can go ahead and catch his eye as you go through the area hey do you need something oh wence oh you want schlond's embrace okay if you're sure about that it's an acquired taste it's made from a very long-distilled 40-year processing of a heavy mint leaf and that when it's been very thickly fermented is mixed in with this very sour port base that's been repeatedly funneled and sifted until it's become almost thick in its own right that's mixed together with a few other sugars and a bit of a special fruit honestly i think it tastes pretty shitty but it's what he likes all right then five gold he goes and makes the drink for you again however he does not bring it in the same glass he brings it in a regular glass you get the sense that the glass that was filled was his own but it's delivered and it's different it almost has a weird mushroomy flavor to it the fermentations involved in the processing of this is not the type of alcohol you'd expect it's a little musty but it's functional and it has an aftertaste that comes to a very strong mint like a wintergreen afterwards it's a very strange mixture yeah kind of in fact elements of it taste like having orange juice after brushing your teeth yeah it's a little rough at times it is a silver and pewter chalice that contains a number of multi-colored gems embedded along the sides going to the base lil' jon would be proud it's beautiful another 20 or so minutes pass in the tavern sure you catch his attention he comes back to the table as you step up and start in his direction he goes hey another round eh all right you want another one varies easily probably another hour or so varies they've been here most of the afternoon oh all right okay i will he looks at the gold and goes all right i will you see he noticeably gets a little nervous walks over do you go back to your table to join your compatriots okay as you're watching he actually has to psych himself up he approaches and then turns around and stops for a second and goes up to the table again and stops himself and gets the gumption up this time and goes to the table and you see him talking to korshad who at this point has his hand on the tip of the drink glances up at him looks over at the table again you see a smile creep slowly across korshad's face puts his hand up and immediately you can watch as wence who's in the middle of talking and expressing this goes yes and quickly darts away korshad gives a point to the rest of the guys and you watch his lips say excuse me a moment he stands up as korshad's walking across the room vax you do watch as all the individuals that are on the upper platform all watch him go through the room and are now seeing the table and where they are standing the attention is very strongly on what is about to transpire korshad walks his way over to the table and you can see as he walks through occasionally somebody at a nearby table will stop and watch him him very quickly to you you get the sense that he's definitely one of the more powerful figures that seems to come in and out of this establishment he approaches the edge of the table still holding the cup from the upper lip there's like a lip at the very edge that he keeps clasped with his fingers as it drifts there in front of him and he occasionally sips from it that way as he walks towards you comes up to the edge of the table do you mind if i sit here he sits down and places the cup on the table (muffled) so (laughter) okay (laughter) i have not had the pleasure but i know of you quite and what agreement do you have proposed we trade in a great many things information being one and i am well aware of who you are are you offering your services (sighs) you are not wrong i myself am the keeper of the deeds i consider the darrington estate a long-growing loan that is now ripening you see our community here thrives on a principle that other syndicates in exandria lack patience i have been letting this stew for a very very long time so if you wish to make any sort of dent in this debt your task will have to be equally monumental you are correct for the time being i have given your father a date of six months to pay this debt if it is not paid then the deeds as agreed upon many years ago transition to my name entirely i am not going to kick your family to the street i am not a terrible man but i will be possessing all of your belongings no not unless they put up a fight both have their uses the family i will happily give them time to find whatever place they can afford to live or leave the city entirely it is not my business however i will be taking over the farms i will be taking over the business i will be taking over the estate most of the assets within they will become property of the myriad if i am to understand you correctly you are willing to offer your service to us and in exchange we would still be taking the land-based assets from the darrington name other than the estate and enough means to live comfortably make a persuasion check he goes comfortable living is a relative thing to maintain my comfort of living well your estate is but a drop in the bucket but and i mean no offense-- as he looks about the rest of you-- comfortable living for some of you well that could be as much as my drink would cost that is not a deal the residential and the farm territory is to become mine i would leave for them your estate and enough gold to live a comparably comfortable lifestyle than living on the street for years to come they could then strike out on their own start a new fortune if they wish perhaps land barony was not their strong suit you seem to have found other pursuits maybe you could lead them in a new path past that point and a task done in our favor by the famed vox machina maybe everything that remains within the estate home itself would be yours to keep the rest is mine roughly 120 miles east of here lies a sinkhole it has swallowed the core of the platinum mines of herethis a few months back now those mines are a very lucrative point of business for my employers and every time we've sent scouts to inspect the source of this erosion none have returned many very capable and proven men unheard again one of our greatest diviners has since spoken of a powerful force within this mine ancient birthed improperly but now seems to grow more and more mad we're at a loss so we've put out a contract or two but nothing has taken a bite yet if you were to go to this mine find this entity that has ruined our mining operation there return with proof of its demise and we confirm its destruction i will consider our task complete that is entirely understood and we will keep track of each fee and we will deduct it from the materials in the darrington estate it may not be but it would seem to be something of your skill set i would agree to that i have no interests in your family's public image i believe that damage has been done well enough on your own (chuckling) he takes another sip from his drink when all this is said and done taryon we'll be in contact i think there is much business we could do in the future the information i have given you is what the diviner has found and this whole conversation he's had his mouth covered he takes his fingers away from his mouth and he takes the drink do we have an accord picks his drink up and clinks it return when the deed is done slaps the table and stands up and walks back and at this point that you notice the tables nearby everyone's been just quietly watching in on this as soon as he leaves they go back to their business and drinking as you do that about half the folks get startled by it the music's still going hey most of them are local and come from all over sorry i just serve the drinks miss okay she's sitting there (drumming) (drumming) as she's still drumming her head slowly turns around and she goes camilla (drumming) (laughs) all right with that we're going to take a break try and get back here in a minute guys see this next bit of interesting fun all right guys so we have tonight's wyrmwood giveaway this awesome butternut wood and leather dice tray giveaway from our friends at wyrmwood come on over jump into the twitch chat to enter for the possibility to win this the word for the night is myriad that is m-y-r-i-a-d if you don't know look it up on google exactly butternut up or shut up with your myriad spelling all right guys be back here in a few minutes see you in a second [break] as you guys have found your way out of what seems to be this strange subterranean bar beneath the grumpy lily you've agreed to at least for the time being to make your way east to this mine which currently seems to be under the-- what's it called the platinum mines of herethis herethis which you taryon you understand herethis is a region a regional forest area over there the herethis wood about 120 miles east you guys decide what's your best means of travel how do you intend to get there it's not terribly far as the mist flies well i'll go ahead and by the way because i totally forgot we do have a winner in the chatroom besolis8926 you won the giveaway yeah denova will contact you for your information to get it shipped to you so congratulations all right so what are you thinking about for travel you're just doing the wind walk you guys haven't you have they're woods that lead into this small rocky-- it's almost too small to be a mountain range and more just large rocky hills but there's no historical significance to the location that you know of go ahead and make a history check 21 you do know a number of the large-scale battles that took place towards the end of the age of arcanum took place on wildmount in fact zorhaus the other kingdom that we were discussing before is largely a badlands barren landscape because that was where the final battle between the betrayer gods and the prime deities took place and the sheer volume of the sheer intensity of that battle laid waste to the landscape there so you have the dwendalian empire and the whole western side of wildmount which is fairly lush and functional then towards the zorhaus kingdom is and that whole eastern side of the continent a lot of it is just barren cracked destroyed but you do know that herethis the name at least stems from a hero that fell in a battle long ago you can't recall the specific details of it but there is some significance to the title or at least the location there to something ancient and old may have to deal with this time period of entities battling gods that's the best you can make out the mines are well known the platinum mines are well known they're not well attended they're not a public space and they're definitely under the control of a number of companies that are shadow corporations under the control of the myriad you can see where the connection and the necessity for it to be reopened again is important platinum is not a very common metal all right so you find k'rynn she let you know that she was just around the corner from where the estate was and let you know where to find her and it's like an open tent/lounge area she's just currently drinking water and eating a little bit of dried meat and as you approach she stands up she still has her illusion on she still has her pale skin you get the sense that drow in general are not-- they don't have the easiest time walking through large societal establishments you returned so what did you need very well i have no interest in staying in this city in particular i generally prefer to stay around vashlow vashlow it's to the west of here about 25 miles southeast of port demali if you wish to contact me you can send a missive to vashlow or if you have access to a practitioner of the arcane arts perhaps a sending would be sufficient very well it was just business eh fair trade she gets up and gathers her little satchel over the side of her shoulder until we meet again she nods and then walks out into the darkness of the night all right so what are you guys doing you're in the evening now misty step is a very different spell yes all right so you guys go ahead and transform into your misty forms via the wind walk spell and begin making your way to the east towards the herethis wood travel is pretty rapid it's a clear sky the moon's still pretty-- it's only been a few days since the last full moon when you guys had the ritual up at the top of the mountains with the trickfoots so it's very easy to see the details especially those of keen vision rather rapidly you find yourselves to the outskirts of the herethis forest and after doing a couple passes overhead you can see there is a portion of the forest that is open and there you can see there are a couple of stone towers set up there appear to be large ropes and cables fastened at the edges of what looks to be a large circular ravine some sort of an entry port a very large hole in the ground and as you approach and get close you can see that while there are two standing towers there appear to be remnants of two other towers that have fallen in and looking at some of the cables and the way that some of the equipment is set up it appears that this sinkhole that he spoke of that consumed a portion of this entryway whether it be a quake or something a lot of the structure that was placed around the outside of the mine has fallen in and is precariously being held either dangling over the inside by cable work or has crumpled somewhere at the bottom of this abyssal hole you see before you when i say abyssal hole that's just a descriptive way of saying it is pitch black from this distance you cannot see anything past the top it is actually a doorway to the abyss hey guys orcus tonight have you guys transitioned back to your physical forms to have this conversation okay make a perception check 24 okay you start coasting over the edge and you can see there are broken carts and crates you can see the remains of what seem to be a couple of humanoid bodies mostly picked away to the point where there's just slightly pinkish bone from whatever dried bits of muscle or blood that remain the rest of the flesh and organs pulled from or dissolved you're not sure so you land about half a mile out and you guys transition back to your physical forms vax shares the information and what he spotted they were on the edges like white and pink bone like just whatever flesh was on there has been picked off all right so is it just you pike who's going with you all right so you go back to the bodies with them all right so the three of you are turning back to mist and making your way back toward the entrance okay you guys land near the edge of this crumpled rock and you see where the ground itself has curled in and collapsed inward and there are a number of cables or ropes that go across and various large structures the stone towers that sit at the edge of this opening you can see there's tension on these ropes and either the rope's going to snap at some point as the weather gets harsher over here or the rock is going to crumble in if the ground keeps eroding you're not sure if it's done or if it's a slow crawling thing there before you you see a body you can see elements of clothing torn and dried crusted with old blood you see a boot that's left off to the side the foot's been removed but it looks like the edge of it's been torn and ripped a bit the skeleton's been picked clean there are three bodies around the whole exterior but you've landed next to one make an investigation check looking at the bones you can see signs of what appear to be scratches or grooves across the bones it's interesting a lot of the bones have a very smooth texture to them you're used to seeing very porous but it looks like elements of the bones have melted slightly okay pike you're casting speak with dead all right it's easy enough for you to cast it it's quick ritual complete you go ahead and you burn some incense and at which point the skeleton which is face down on the ground by the way the skull (bone creaking) creaks up and looks over like turns around and faces you as it reaches it curls upward almost in like an upward dog-- cobra position but the head's turned completely around and curled up (rattling thud) it flips over on its back and the head (bone creaking) turns back around to its right you get five questions (raspy strained) something in the mines we found it hatched or woke and its anger shook the halls i tried to run but the skittering beasts got me first (raspy strained) large hard carapaces pincers many legs (grunts) he seems confused about what you're referring to the skittering creature or the-- the skittering creatures we just ran i didn't look to see they were rather large maybe eight foot end to end they burrow they spit but they were awoken by the smaller one you gather what he said was-- (laughing) it was like a baby and it cried out and everything fell around us i barely made it out but the skitterers found me (deep exhale) the enchantment leaves that embodied the skull falls to rest the bones now motionless i would say marisha-- we'll say a nature check for both you and vex not for this in particular no it's not something you've encountered before necessarily 19 okay and vex yeah you have heard of a creature that does exist in subterranean and sometimes forested areas referred to as an ankheg an ankheg they generally tend to snatch cattle and beasts of burden in the night they are large and insect-like they spit an acidic fluid some of the things this corpse has described makes you think of that you bug juice is made of sandkheg which is a desert-based variant of that creature if only the person who could cast the spell was in your party anymore he's elsewhere in the world right now all right so what are you guys doing okay 5th-level commune with nature instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area terrain bodies of water prevalent plants minerals animals or peoples powerful celestials fey fiends elementals or undead influence from other planes of existence or buildings choose three of those okay so as you focus and commune with nature the plants speak to you in this series of images and thoughts that essentially get the idea across to you that there is something planar involved here but it's very old and long-dormant recently awoken you can ask whereabouts this thing is nature tells you this sinkhole goes down for about a quarter-mile and it lies at the very bottom apparently yeah the whole ground just collapsed inward one of the two they are monstrosities and that's what they look like right there using the nature's essence to let you know somewhere in the neighborhood of about close to a hundred throughout the network of caves-- yeah so this is spread out amongst what would essentially be a subterranean anthill of these ankhegs it seems to be the source of where all this started or at least brought them to start attacking the surface you don't know this is all the information you have yeah that's right that was what was essentially a dead or stillborn deity a demigod essentially in its own pocket plane roll a religion check yeah if you want to whoever's having this conversation you can make a religion check okay you recall a while back that you battled with that entity you-- what was it called crysa-thul (sighs) this is all i do with my free time guys make up shit for fun but that was not tiny that was a very large entity like to the point where you remember there was a 20-foot-wide well and a giant fleshy baby arm that slapped out and crawled it out akira-style everyone kept saying small on this one so you don't know if-- maybe related in some way but you're not entirely certain it doesn't appear to be the same kind of thing necessarily not by the descriptor you've heard it called it a small one yeah the thick forest of herethis surrounds the mine we'll say druidcraft which is a very localized and cantrip-based magic you could over the next couple hours craft a single web hammock (groaning) yeah this is what it would look like if you were to build to scale okay so you guys find a place in the trees who's helming finding that spot all right go ahead and roll an investigation check okay no this is exactly where to use it because forest is your favored terrain this is exactly the kind of thing it would help with yes 24 you find one massive tree the trees here can get pretty big and there's one thick tree that the branches are pretty easy to climb and up top it branches out and all the various branches that make up the canopy it's almost like this little bowl at the very top just underneath where the heavy foliage descends and it's a perfect place for you guys to make a camp higher up off the ground all right you guys make camp who's making first watch all right we'll say as a note this the last of the chalices you have prepared if you want to do any more heroes' feasts you'll have to specifically go and purchase the chalices or go look for it in town that chalice while it looks quite delightful is not worth a thousand gold pieces (laughs) it's a little gaudy yeah every time you drink from it you get glitter on your hands and you're like shit you're immune to fear immune to poison and-- marisha you want to go ahead and roll the additional hit points for heroes' feast 2d10 i believe you do so 19 additional hit points to all of you guys temporary hit points last until they go down or you take a long rest i believe let me double check well no they're different the heroes' feast is in addition to your maximum hit points temporary hit points are different technically those two stack you're about to lose the temporary hit points should you be so inclined yeah you can give the essence of a speech it's a speech you can give the essence of it but the idea here is just you honing your public speaking skills temporary hit points they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest yes i was correct cool all right we'll say for the purpose of brevity because even at your guys' level if you did encounter anything in this forest that was indigenous you'd splatter it in a round but you don't have any issues nothing really sees you up in the branches you occasionally get caught off guard by the sound of a nearby (hooting) it's an owl in the trees but nothing seems to bother you during your evening slumber you complete your long rest you still maintain your benefits from the heroes' feast and as morning comes keyleth gives a rousing speech you can just describe the topics you talk about you don't have to give the actual speech keyleth voice of the tempest all right guys there you go take your 17 temporary hit points no it's just her level no because the 17 once the 17 goes it's gone it's still your maximum you can heal to it yeah that is the difference yes what are you doing okay yeah (laughs) the inventory of the items you've lost to guests lost and gave away what level level one you got it okay (laughs) the kigurumi of useful trinkets what's the question drop a what a fireball well a fireball is a small bead of magic energy that has a range so if it reaches the end of the range it has no effect you could you take half bludgeoning damage when you impact bacon points 17 bacon points to be fair i've eaten some bacon in my time that's given me some temporary hit points just saying oh completely okay oracle arrow you fire it it's a big pit the radius of a small flame on an arrow doesn't seem to light up the walls it's not bright enough so it just descends and descends and the wood is catching and burning and eventually it hits the stony earthy floor at the bottom (arrow impact) and it clatters and breaks a little bit it's burning pretty heavily and you glance around the space inside and you can see what looks like some broken mining equipment on the ground jutting out in places you see what appears to be some sort of stony platform that is carved but mildly forgotten or eroded steps and the rest of the arrow burns up and you lose your vision well the diameter of the actual hole is maybe about-- not quite that big i'd say it's about 150 200 feet across no okay the flying carpet the one that you have 800 pound capacity you can fit grog and one other person i think you could probably fit grog percy and pike conjure an air elemental as you finish the conjuration with the staff and slam it into the ground at the edge of the entranceway you watch as a nearby cloud starts to swirl and descend and you hear this cracking sound as the planar shift between your plane and the elemental plane of air briefly hiccups open and then summons forth an air elemental that (whoosh) rushes down under your control it is concentration keep that in mind all righty so two brooms of flying magic carpet wings laura and and you are the carpet's full okay we can do that all right so you guys slowly begin to descend down this heavy open tunnel yes so i would like all you guys to make a stealth check please yep reliable rogues man that's what rogues are good at 30 okay as you guys all descend you get about halfway down the tunnel and you can hear this occasional echo (clicking) and for those of you that have darkvision you look off to the side and you see there are these small openings these tunnels in the sides and occasionally you see a large insect-like creature skitter out (clicking) and then into another hole none seem to see or notice your presence you continue delving deeper and deeper and deeper looking up above you can see the slowly vanishing circle of daylight above you and as you continue further and further down those of you with darkvision you begin to see a floor begin to approach okay you halt the carpet make a perception check okay it doesn't block all the light because it's the helm of brilliance as you guys are being somewhat stealthy going down here taryon is still a slight beacon of fire his helmet just emits a glow at all times okay you glance about and you can see this opening at the bottom there's some warping to the earth here it's one large chamber that's almost peanut-shaped it pinches in the center and closes around and there's a small tunnel that leads off and then closes at the end it appears to be what may have been some sort of mine shaft that has then collapsed on the opposite side but the center here looks like there's some fallen barrels and chest pieces and there are pieces of rods and rope and cords strewn about and there's this ancient stone platform that rises up in the center and what appears to be some sort of a small recess in the stonework there it looks like it's the size of a football carved downward oh it is currently not emitting light you could probably get closer okay because you're a ways from it and you have no light down here even with your darkvision you can make out some details the closer you get you see a number of small carvings in what looks like some sort of language that i don't believe you understand you don't see it it's pitch-black for you mr human nope nope nope nope the humans are sitting there in pitch black seeing this tiny little bead of light above and just hoping that someone's going to give them some indicator it's contained but it's still a single beam so you go ahead and get close on the broom right you open up the hood of the light and it immediately beams this stark red beam down on this portion and you look at it it is celestial it appears to be runes of gestation and protection it speaks of a seed a guardian for ages to come symphior you notice as this pale white light begins to slowly appear a little ways ahead of you in the other side of the chamber this light is emanating from some-- you guys begin to drift back on the carpet and you see this beacon of light hovering maybe ten feet up off the ground about the same height that you guys were to the platform and you see there what appears to be a cherub it's a baby or an infant but it appears to be withered and gray and its arms and legs hang limply and it has these small white angel-like wings but the feathers are tattered and broken in places and the head's lolled back and as the glow grows from it it goes (wheezes screams) and gives out this heinous scream that echoes throughout the whole hall you can't help but instinctually grab your ears i would like you all to make a wisdom saving throw please which actually you are immune to fear so it does not affect you however it shakes the interior and you watch as small stones (thud) hitting the ground around you you guys looking up above you can see that this scream is affecting the structure a little bit i need you all to roll initiative so we have up here by the platform there it is it's very tiny all right initiatives 25 to 20 anybody who rolled what jesus christ percy all right so 20 to 15 all right 15 to 10 ten to five all righty all right guys we're going to keep this coming at everyone fast because we're going to make this happen all right first and foremost as this creature emerges and you guys are in your respective places percival you're up first you're up here near the top of the platform where you saw the recess yeah it appeared on the opposite side of this double chamber it's all up from there okay so you hop off of there you can see it yes but you cannot see the terrain around you so percival what are you doing oh this side you can get about there you don't quite get to the wall you can get further but currently the creature is out of your view okay that's your turn all right vax all right about there it's straight up where you see the walls are right now even this is collapsed about here in fact i'd say to keep it easier i'll say that's a collapsed entrance there but this is all a straight-up hole in the ground it slowly funnels as it gets to the bottom all righty all righty that hits correct right correct dash is your full movement which is-- cool you fly by your sister okay no worries that ends your turn all right pike you're up actually sorry before the end of your turn it's going to go ahead and use a legendary action to use a terrain shift yep as you stab the creature it (gasps) there's a horrible sucking sound as you dart back it looks over in your direction the wings flutter once and it brings its arms up and as it does and you land next to your sister you feel the air around you begin to freeze in cold this energy's just (crackling) you feel ice crystals condense around and both of you feel the air in your lungs suddenly begin to freeze up i need both of you guys to make constitution saving throws nice constitution saving throw all righty 19 points of cold damage to you vex and that is nine points of cold damage to you vax and while you manage to pull out of this space of condensed cold vax your sister however becomes stunned for one round as your body is frozen and locked in place you watch the air coalesce into this frozen area and while the broom is still holding you aloft thankfully you are standing there in place and the ice falls clatters and slams into the ground below you sounding like the shattering of a hundred pieces of crystal across the stonework pike now it's your turn it's a level two spiritual weapon where are you putting the spiritual weapon all right i believe you get to make an attack with it then if you do all right so once again roll for attack on that so you roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier 13 (whoosh) it swings and the creature flaps out of the way and avoids the blow are you going to move or stay where you are you do no you take half the damage but you're still stunned you would take nine damage instead of the 19 so do you want to move with your turn okay beacon of hope the range on that is 30 feet 30-foot range gets everybody except for the elemental beacon of hope you have advantage on wisdom saving throws death saving throws and you regain the max number of hit points possible from any healing all righty that end your turn at the end of your turn the creature goes (raspy breathing) and you watch as the ground right beneath the carpet explodes it peels back as molten lava suddenly begins to spill up in a column beneath you splattering up and to the back and over the top of the carpet i need everybody in this cluster this ten-foot-by-ten-foot section to make a dexterity saving throw so grog pike and keyleth danger sense 18 natural 20 plus what's your-- pike's the only one who made it pike you suffer 21 points of fire damage halved because of your armor so you only take ten ten points of fire damage i need you to go ahead and make a concentration check on beacon of hope just roll a constitution saving throw keyleth and grog you guys both take 42 points of fire damage the ground below you right now is currently in flames and you guys have to stick around that space there the open ground is billowing flame and lava now and the area around that platform is searing hot so what did you roll a five with your-- yeah you lose beacon of hope sorry you have to get above half the damage you took or ten whichever is higher you guys can choose to stay on the carpet you pull out of the way and now the area is just billowing with lava and flame keyleth it's your turn all right you took how much damage 42 make a concentration check constitution saving throw yes you have to get over a 21 a 21 or over 21 you just maintain concentration 90-feet flying speed yeah he gets over there easy plops on over okay nope this is not a very strong creature go ahead and roll the damage on that yeah random direction i'll roll for that okay that's going to fling him 20 feet into the five ten 15 20 into the wall right there and prone to it right now no you would have to get off the carpet to go okay at the top of your turn by the way you suffer eight points of fire damage by the proximity to the flaming platform there it's not so much a weather effect it's more that there's a heaping column of molten rock eight points of fire damage and i need you to make another concentration check yeah this is considered subterranean not underdark cavern all right so you've done that what do you want to do keyleth you're over here yeah so you leap over and you get line of sight on him right there sure what's the dc on that and it's a constitution saving throw i believe six plus ten so it's a 16 yeah so roll your 8d8 necrotic damage yeah no even with advantage on the save it rolled a six and a four nice as you reach it's on the ground it's trying to get back up and its wings are flapping and all of a sudden you watch as its gray withered skin turns dark black on one half of its body and it (screech) shrieks out and gives another scream (hoarse scream) from the ground and the area quakes again and you feel the ground shimmy a bit the ground beneath you as its last legendary action begins to give way keyleth i need you to make a dexterity saving throw yeah this is a different area nope so as you finish casting this and you hear it scream you cover your ears and suddenly the ground moves out beneath you you watch as the actual floor (whoosh) as you watch keyleth plummet into a pit below you take eight points of bludgeoning damage and the ground (whoosh) covers over her keyleth vanishes the ground seems to swallow her up keyleth the entire pit collapses in on you and you're currently restrained underground and you cannot breathe i need you to make another concentration check yes yeah okay that ends your turn keyleth i am because it's his turn the cherub creature this symphior begins to fly up off the ground and make its way back in this direction out into the open once more as it floats upward it looks over towards where-- let's see because all it sees is you two you both are still in the flames right there it's not worried about the fire at the moment it sees you taryon and goes (hoarse wheezing) and lifts its hands up i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw that's great so you only suffer 11 points of piercing damage as you leap out of the way you watch as the ground suddenly turns into a series of earthlike spikes underneath and some pierce you and scratch you and you roll out of the way you barely move off to the side where now you see this giant jutting series of spike-like pillars forcing up from the ground all right that's going to end that attack and it's going to use the rest of its movement to move back (whoosh) over to there in the corner that brings us back to vex it's your turn now yeah so you're stunned and that's your turn you eventually break the ice off at the end of your turn and you're breathing heavily and trying to get the feeling back in your skin that's your go grog you're up it's an action which spell do you have what's the casting time of jump what's the casting time of jump so that would be your action to use it on yourself okay you also take seven points of fire damage at the start of your turn because you're by this flame over to this side there okay yeah you run (whoosh thud) land next to it with the run and the jump you have maybe ten feet yeah you're right up on him you have an action still well no because you said it's a bonus action to do the leap what's it say on that just to do the leap right it was the run you still have an action go for it okay 26 with the minus five yeah that hits all righty that's your first strike you have extra attack man 24 does not hit it's a tiny size it's hard to swing at and as your axe almost catches it it (whoosh) out of the way yep that's your turn at the end of your turn because it's reset back to its ground it's going to go ahead and look to you in front of it and go (hoarse breathing) make a dexterity check dexterity saving throw sorry the ground crumbles beneath you and you suddenly (whoosh) fall below you are raging it would've been 12 points of bludgeoning damage but it becomes six but you are suddenly buried and restrained underground freedom of movement i'll say it doesn't have-- well he's buried in the ground regardless that's the effect he didn't avoid the burying so i guess you'd just if you want to use your action to try to escape you do so all right that ends that go taryon you're up you've got a pretty close look if you wanted to take a moment to inspect at 60 feet of movement you're not quite within melee range of it oh that'll do okay go ahead and roll for an attack what's the range on war god's blessing no he's out of range for that unfortunately sorry as you (ring firing) it (whoosh) out of the way and the fist goes by slamming into the wall (crash) it got you a kill the marid yeah so you're just like (ring firing) no effect it dodges out of the way and now you can see its weird lifeless white eyes turn towards you once more that end your turn all righty let's see here it's going to go ahead and use another ability now as it sees that you're closed in it glances over and you watch as suddenly a bunch of stonework just (rushing noise) up in the center of the area as now-- a giant stone wall suddenly shoots up above to about 40 feet you're underneath right over here you're on the outskirts of the wall yeah you and the baby and an air elemental and a giant sword that's swinging but you lose vision entirely pike just (rushing noise) wall's in front of you percy you're up no the wall would have to go way high it's about 40 feet up your movement will not get you to the top because you only move 30 feet it'll get you about there i'll put you right there to remind us but you're almost at the top of the wall at your full movement okay you get to the top of the wall there and you can now see it you can get partway down the wall yeah so you get about i'll say there on the opposite side that's your turn percy okay all right at the end of your turn percy let's see it's going to go ahead and use-- it's legendary actions it manipulates the area around it because you are currently standing on the side there no you know what it's going to hold off it's not going to do anything vax you're up okay okay you immediately take eight points of fire damage by getting close to the flames to grab her it's like (fire noises) i'd say it would be an action to grab her enough and you're going to move at half speed with her yeah action and your movement there was about there i'd say you'll get your action and your movement will get you to up above the wall right hold on no you used an action to pick up pike you brought her up there you moved you have another action and a bonus action you have an action and a bonus action but the extra action that you have is from your haste which means it can be used for either a melee attack or ranged okay there you go put you down there that hits that just hits yeah if you'd like to yeah 47 nice as you swipe down to (whoosh) fling whisper out it slams right into the chest of the creature and it impales it off the back side and there's the burst of divine energy inside but you see the divine energy matches its own and what looks like a blow that would've killed the creature it's like (raspy inhale) turns back towards you and gives another scream as the dagger returns to you end of your turn all right at the end of your turn it's going to use its last legendary action it's going to use another cold snap you feel the air around you familiar (whoosh) condense and the ice cling to you the air in your lungs freezes solid it seems go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw 25 will succeed all right so you shrug off the stunned effect but you do still suffer the halved damage 13 points of cold damage all righty pike you're up top of your turn you suffer no damage because you got out of the fire you're at the top of the wall now yes roll an athletics check it's 40 feet down so that's going to be a long climb it's a natural one you do so you use your reaction to cast feather fall on yourself as you stumble off the side and as you plummet about 20 or so of the 40 feet (whoosh soft impact) and you land unscathed on the ground that's your reaction to do that with the shield not physically it's over here and you're at the base of the wall you can get within range to it okay what level oh shit okay go ahead and roll for an attack on that wait is guiding bolt an attack no is it a saving throw i think it's a saving throw isn't it i always forget that no it's a ranged spell attack so you have to roll to hit it go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier because you can do that guided strike you get to add that to your own attack (laughs) still checking it guided strike yeah plus ten to the roll that'll do it 29 boom go ahead and roll damage on that well it's four levels above that so it's 8d6 radiant damage six sixes 42 points so as you land gently on the ground after plummeting head over heels (thuds fire blast) holding your holy symbol before you you watch as this beam of condensed divine energy rockets across and this tiny floating withered planar baby (fire blast) gets blasted you watch as the wings get pushed back it's holding itself in place but you see the dark shadow outline as the energy is blasting through it as it hits its wings recoil and it's still floating there but you can see this sparkly outline of divine energy because the next attack on it has advantage you do your sword's still up spiritual weapon you can move 20 feet as a bonus action it moves up and takes a swipe go ahead and roll an attack 29 hits yeah so go ahead and roll the damage for the spiritual weapon which is 1d8 plus five i think for you whatever your wisdom modifier is seven points of damage it all helps all righty keyleth you're up you're underground you are restrained you are blind you cannot see anything okay and with that ability you get an earthglide and this is a non-issue for you all righty keyleth so you are an earth elemental what's your speed 60 earthglide yeah totally you're moving into melee with the baby sure go ahead and roll a slam attack make two slam attacks so roll twice it's plus eight to attack each time yeah that misses marisha okay but that one is a natural 20 you double whatever you rol for the 2d8 and then add plus five crit that baby it's our next t-shirt crit that baby the bonus isn't doubled just the dice that's great 27 points of damage (wham) slamming onto the ground as your hand retracts up you can see the wings are-- as it starts to fly up it (gasps) go for it 18 and 17 plus eight both hit go ahead and roll damage nice no this was just hitting it (impacts) all righty that's the end of your turn all right as it comes back to the entity's turn it's looking really really rough and as part of that it's going to reach into itself its hands push into its torso and as it screams (raspy scream) it gives out this horrible scream as it tears some of its chest open and from the inside where you imagine it would be a ribcage it's this impossibly bright light that echoes out in a shockwave affecting everybody except for vex actually i need everybody else to make a constitution saving throw yes nope so 22 that succeeds that succeeds pike okay succeeds everyone who succeeds you suffer 48 points of radiant damage yes if you failed you took 96 points of radiant damage the cloak doesn't say a spell effect technically because it's not a leveled spell it's just a radiant blast it would not affect it no it wouldn't 96 points of radiant damage so keyleth i need you-- your elemental has gone berserk aside of rolling a 20 go for it just try even so i'm letting you have this opportunity nope so as the conjure elemental spell fails the control of your elemental shifts and now it's aggressively turning its attention towards you and the rest of your party no that's not how this works yeah actually roll a constitution saving throw for the air elemental it's a plus two the air elemental is actually destroyed to your advantage strangely all right so the entity looks like it's barely hanging on and you see parts of its internal body falling out from where it tore its chest open it's going to use a bonus action to misty step out of this vicinity over to here it's going to use its movement to fly high up almost trying to escape the cavern now it's up in that region right there we'll say here on top of this turn that away all righty vex you're up you fly up and you see everyone below is wrecked the ground is charred with some sort of a radiant blast you watched it flash over the wall itself like a small rapid recreation of the intro of akira (boom) this big arcing ball of white energy sure okay strength i actually rolled a natural 17 but it still takes the damage 40 nice so as it hits you watch as the brambles try and wrap around it but it actually flies free 42 total you can see more of it's just falling out of its small decomposing torso and it's trying to fly upward now towards the light it's on the edge okay go for it 28 hits roll damage how do you want to do this (cheering) all right as you pull back as it's fluttering up you take aim and release and as the arrow strikes it you can see the same way the dagger hit the baby it hits it and throws it the sheer force of the arrow against the wall and pins it there like it's stapled to the rock as it reaches over to try and pull the arrow out and it begins to suddenly the arrow (whoosh) breaks into a bunch of bramble vines that begin to wrap around it and you watch as the tiny baby arm and wing try and reach out (choking) as it constricts and twists and slowly constrains it until you see it (crack) pop and go limp on the inside of the vines and as the vines unfurl what was physically there is slowly dissipating into a glitter-like powder the body dissipating and falling apart you don't know actually okay i'd say you could probably over time yeah you have enough constitution to be fine no he's fine he can hold his breath for six minutes he's got a really high constitution so you're fine you slowly pummel the rock out from his way and pull grog out from the interior of the stone floor okay so you gather some glitter in make an investigation check i mean there are a number of visible edges of veins in this whole mine there's a lot of platinum but you have to mine it and as you guys are having this moment you begin to hear the loud sound of hundreds of large insect-like creatures climbing their way down the walls okay so you rush over and grab the carpet and you guys begin to make your way back up through there is a small tree growing out of the side of the wall from where you killed the creature but it's not large enough for that spell yeah it grows and twists out like a bonsai curves upward all right so you guys are coasting up through the shaft okay you guys begin heading up through the center column of this opening as you're moving up are you staying in the darkness okay so (boom) this light now emerges from this area and as you can see now through this cavern around you there's about a dozen or so of these large ankheg creatures about every 30 feet or so 40 feet up you're in the center of-- you look up and you can see easily the hundred that you saw earlier have all been drawn to the surface by the screams of this creature and as you begin rocketing up with this daylight spell you watch as some of them start hanging upward in your direction you start hearing this sound (hiss) they're apparently attracted to your presence it is a line shot i'm going to go ahead and have let's see here percy and vex i need you guys to both make a constitution saving throw sorry sorry not constitution dexterity my apologies yeah roll again it's fine yeah you both make it so you both suffer eight points of acid damage there are over a hundred and they take more than a few shots to go we'll say you start picking them off a few as you go but you watch them fall past you there's just such a mass number of them as you guys get up another 40 or so feet (spray sound) again from three different ones all right i need taryon percival and vex again to make dexterity saving throws okay okay six points of acid damage to the three of you you make your way up even further you're about halfway up this tunnel at this point and now you're getting to the heavy cluster of these creatures at this point a large cluster of them begin to spray all across i need all of you guys to make two dexterity saving throws anybody get lower than a 13 for one yeah that would be all of you except for pike and grog take a total of 14 points of acid damage both of you guys for the purposes of this take 21 points of acid damage as you're shooting and you hear the gunfire (gunshots) going off you fire the arrows more and more of these ankhegs are falling and crumbling off you hear the (screeching) as they streak past you plummeting into the darkness below even more so throwing streams out however their numbers are starting to thin because you've gone past the thick part of it vax pike and grog the three of you guys roll dexterity saving throws please all right six points of acid damage six points of acid damage 12 points of acid damage you guys with the brooms and the carpet it's not super fast putting up there again you get about three-quarters of the way up she's on the carpet wind wall is stationary it might help with one round of the spray you'll find out you don't know okay as you guys are heading upward now you're about three-quarters of the way out the numbers are thinning a little bit they start spraying once more you go ahead and create a wind wall that you've been preparing as you watch these jets of extremely acidic burning liquid shoot toward you suddenly a column of wind gets conjured upward from the darkness and deflects the spray into a mist that is thrown back against the wall harmlessly you're almost to the exit and you see a handful more towards the very top of this cavern keyleth percy and pike make a dexterity saving throw if you can okay so eight points of acid damage 16 keyleth all right that's eight points of acid damage you took the-- the eight yeah as you guys just crest out of the top of the dark column below you can watch as the creatures are starting to skitter out from the edges but you are far above and a few of them are spraying but you're above the range and it's coasting over and disappearing below you've now emerged into the night sky the moonlight above you you're all fairly beaten you're going to throw a wall of fire on the edge of it what's the radius on blade barrier okay we'll say as you come out the top you throw down the blade barrier-- what's the radius of it though i'll pull it up real fast okay so you can make a wall around the one side of it not the whole thing you don't get to get the whole radius but between the wall of fire and the bladed wall you blast the opening there you coast away watching and hearing as dozens of ankhegs that are climbing up to the top begin to (screeching) eventually they all begin to burrow back into the rock and stone and vanish the ones on the surface begin to burrow below and a calm stillness comes over the exterior of the mines as you all coast up hundreds of feet in the air over the forest licking your wounds so you removed the glitter and you removed-- the little stone placard you had to wedge it out but you got it up there and that's where we'll call it for the night aw man that was also created by the chat that was a tiny celestial was the prospect of doing something that attacks via the terrain instead of-- the actual title for it is symphior the withered planetar it was essentially a celestial seed that was placed to eventually emerge as a guardian in a future time almost a ragnarok-type circumstance but the land around it became corrupted as it gestated or was held in stasis and then was awoken prematurely and as such became this horrible monstrous version of what it was supposed to be it was neutral but it was dangerous it seemed pretty far gone thank you guys so much we'll be back next week with the battle royale that'll be fun it was pretty good yeah it was pretty slick exactly
