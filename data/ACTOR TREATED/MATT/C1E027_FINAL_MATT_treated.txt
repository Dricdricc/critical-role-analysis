that game here and then more stuff's coming out for the week thereafter really excited about that and i custom-made a witchhunter class for him that i tailored for that level and there's been such a wide response for everyone asking about the class that i've now spent a lot of my free time that i'm not preparing for this game now customizing a homebrew witchhunter class for all of you to partake in so that'll be fun and probably coming out sometime next week it'll probably be broken you're welcome to homebrew my homebrew i'm not perfect but it should be fun and a cool guide for some people to

any other announcements or shall we dive in really that's awesome (cheering) that's awesome go show your support for fiona and awesome let's go ahead and bring the mood back to our realm of imagination and fantasy and be back here in just a minute with the beginning of this night's critical role [dramatic music] isn't it though cow-mouflage and engaged a guardian of this roc a gnome druid who had been removed from society for quite some time after some rather roundabout and at some points on-the-edge-of-conflict conversation they managed to convince him to instead take the bird and flee across the ozmit sea to the northwest towards vasselheim where it would be a much better landscape for the creature to thrive and grow after that the party is making their way back right around the beginning of daybreak towards the keep so that is where we left off percy darkness cold lonely darkness a flicker of light it swells bright white blinding then flashes of your family screaming julius silenced by a bolt to the throat vesper thrown from a tower wall your younger brothers' lifeless bodies tossed in a pile the smell of death filling your cell your father frederick a blade jutting from his chest slick with crimson your mother johanna burned with irons screaming cassandra running towards you calling your name into the night begging you to help one two three arrows she falls darkness once more darkness and red red of blood red of burning fire the sky is fire the world burns with flame and iron the smoke rises from the cinders coalescing into a face black as soot with eyes as burning coals and a wicked grin it speaks with a raspy rumbling bass like a slow-moving landslide you hold your vengeance percival you made it you only need to take it for yourself make the world right my gift is yours and your gift shall bring justice our bargain stands eager to close you suddenly come to consciousness gasping loudly against the air you feel the warmth of the forge across the side of the workshop crawling across your face you are sitting at your workbench having fallen asleep amidst a pile of contraptions in mid-construction as you look around you can see your leather gloves are still on apron on blackened soot spread across your face and a series of things you were in mid-build on broken before you on your workshop table there's nobody in the room and you have no idea you're underground in the workshop you haven't seen the sun probably for a good day and a half you have no idea quite how long you've been down here and you've been left alone for quite some time you go and open the metallic door that leads into your workshop and come around the corner and there's a chair set in the corner where jarett would be sitting one of the head guards at your facility jarett however is standing hands up to his throat going (choking sounds) with no visible assailant i want you to go ahead and roll initiative and that's how percy does it all right so what's your total 28 (laughs) you are definitely-- okay you are up first what do you want to do as you come around the corner and you see this visual in front of you if you want to go ahead and roll for trinket too 19 nice it looks like he's trying to remove something from around his neck and looking down you can see his feet are actually off the ground kicking it looks like there's a little bit of air wisping around behind him you can certainly go for it and try you can try it'll be with disadvantage but you can definitely make it this will be disadvantage against an invisible assailant so what's the total total of 15 still hits okay what's the dc on that sure enough you see all of a sudden the air go (gasp) and jaret falls to his knees (coughs) go for it jarett's on his knees prone essentially you still have disadvantage on these no you still have disadvantage on these it is still an invisible creature 20 hits 13 does not hit oh yes 20 hits nine points of damage (gunshots) the gunshots are echoing through the hallway whatever this weird entity is you can see some of the nearby cloth and dust swirl up from its movement you hear this (gasping sound) this angry sucking sound in the air around you do you want to move or are you staying where you are you see some sort of shimmer of wind come around the corner towards you this one turns around and (whooshing sound) over to the bars and you can see in the distance it's moving over towards where your captive currently is i'm getting to that at the end of this combat round all of you guys are right toward the outskirts of the keep and you hear the muffled ringing of gunshots from the inside of the keep you do hear this as you're just getting to the outer gates no he is not the entity swooshes down the stairs and comes at you that's going to be a 22 and a 12 it swings towards you and a giant slam of extremely condensed air with a raking claw impact hits you in the torso doing 15 points of bludgeoning damage the other one swings out same direction this time you actually pull off to the side and knock it out of the way with your pepperbox the one back there is going to attempt to grapple succeeds that's its action and you can see the driver that you had put into prison is currently being (choking) making strangling sounds in the distance that ends it trinket's up all right go ahead and roll for the attack that will hit (laughs) it begins so roll 2d4 and then multiply those by two 17 damage nice trinket runs up coming out of his somewhat sleepy stupor goes for a bite attack and grabs nothing with it and turns around and rakes a claw backwards manages to get the back of whatever this entity is and you hear it scream (gasping scream) you do at least yes it could've because it uses half its movement speed to get up its movement is actually 50 not that you know that but it moved far for what you think it should've been able to congrats (laughs) i'm proud of you jarett then gets up sees this happening moves over and pulls out the key to try and open the prison door spends the turn doing so manages to get the door open that's the end of jarett's turn okay now the rest of you guys roll initiative let it roll naturally that would normally count but it's fine wherever it lands you take it going forward okay so 25 to 20 you hear the gunshot you're entering this intensity so scanlan stays behind 25 to 20 20 to 15 what are your scores liam and vex what'd you get again 15 tiberius and what'd you get vax 15 all right three 15s you got three okay all right so you guys all spend your turn if you choose to to rush through the gates as soon as the gunshots go off you can see shayne's up on top and she sees it gives a quick turn and you can see the gates begin to open and you hear this angry grunting as your half-orc guard is now pulling the doors open as fast as he can you guys find a moment and slip through running towards the front of the keep you guys manage to get with full dash and full turn including your flight-- because you fly a little bit faster but you have a little more of an arc to get over-- you guys get to the front of the keep this turn so you won't get into this until next round that brings it back to the top percy you're up it's hard to see you can ignore cover but you have this entity in front of you i mean you'll be at disadvantage regardless because you're shooting at something invisible and you have something that's in melee of you and you have a ranged weapon you glance down at the glove and you see the gemstone in the center of the palm is currently dark and lifeless currently i mean you can if you want to it'll get a free strike on you the one in front of you okay go for it with disadvantage on each shot so pepperbox (explosion sound) you go to shoot and-- the barrel gets clogged and the front of it actually catches fire for a second and you have to shake it out right now it's completely offset and it's going to take a moment to even get it to where you can fire again you do and you've used one attack you have two more attacks yeah that weapon you have to use an action to repair okay go ahead and make a melee attack this is strength-based add your proficiency modifier and your strength modifier you still have disadvantage on it because you can't see it and you're not proficient 15 just barely hits (cheering) okay so four points of damage as you bludgeon it you took a turn to get it out your third attack is then slamming it in the side whatever entity you smacked gets pushed against the wall go ahead and roll a d20 for me okay so the impact does not appear to damage bad news in this instance it is a fragile construct and even doing melee attacks with it does subject it to a misfire possibility i know okay so that concludes your turn okay you stay there all right the one that's in front of you now is going to go ahead and go over this way trinket-- well no it's still in melee so it doesn't actually get an attack it does get two strikes on you that is a 17 and that is 18 so it does just hit you no i've eliminated that no the dodge is not there it rarely came into play okay so that puts you at another 15 points of bludgeoning damage as it just smacks you right across the head your eyes go dizzy for a second and you take a minute to refocus your vision and you can now see in the air the shimmering expression that looks like a humanoid face stretched and ghastly going (gasps) in front of you but it's still barely even visible and only because of the proximity to you are you able to actually make out any sort of shape or shimmer in the air in front of you the other one is attempting to choke out the prisoner however the prisoner resists through athletics so he's currently holding back at bay the strength of the entity that ends its turn trinket's up (laughs) to do a real leap trinket would have to back up and then run towards it if trinket wants to do that okay so trinket backs up as it does it gets one free swipe at trinket that is 18 to hit i don't know why either yeah we'll say 18 so that hits trinket takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage as the entity swings out and backhands trinket however trinket now leaps-- go ahead and make an athletics check athletics yeah 17 yeah trinket leaps forward slamming this entity onto the ground and knocking it prone and you get to go ahead and make a bite attack so trinket manages to knock it prone however because it gets pushed out of the way trinket has a hard time trinket just makes a big slash and a bite out in the air where it once was and misses entirely but he is knocked prone jarett's now going to attempt to grapple the entity jarett manages to reach out and grab onto whatever this creature is hold onto it just grappling and is going to attempt to try and pull it back for this i will do a contested roll on that it rolled a one jarett pulled it back that far managing to let go of its quarry and is currently holding onto some sort of angry whirling entity at that point that ends jarett's turn the rest of you guys all manage to make your way up into the armory up top first is vex you rush in there and what do you want to do okay you can get just about there (laughs) i would say this guy has three-quarters cover so it would be disadvantage on the attack you already have disadvantage because it's invisible so it's hard to hit regardless 28 28 hits 15 points of damage the first arrow sinks into whatever's there and you can see it jutting out of no physical space technically it's part of your attack you can do two attacks first then you can bonus action so you're like (arrow sounds) and then you hunter's mark it after second shot shatters against the back wall of the stone you can hunter's mark for your bonus all right entity is now hunter's marked that ends vex's turn keyleth you now also make your way into the doorway about there nothing's in visual sight right now unfortunately no half of that was getting to that point you could dash and try and make your way in but you wouldn't be able to do anything you could yeah your call what do you got grog you're on deck okay keyleth waits there grog you're up you have a little better movement so you actually manage to get two more squares in what's your speed again 50 yeah you manage to get up to there and now your turn begins all right so you charge in angry you see jarett's currently reaching back and trying to go for his crossbow now that this entity's in his face he's grappled it with one arm and he's reaching back to try and grab it you come rushing in go for it all right cool so as you pull out (glass breaking) the pain from the glass even further angers you in your rage you can see a mix of holy water and blood trickle down from your fist as you clench it go ahead and swing for a punch with disadvantage so that first strike just whiffs over through your anger you're unable to focus on where this entity may be what's the total 15 just barely hits go ahead and roll go ahead and roll that half that damage yes plus strength so eight points of damage to it all righty (whack) it hits and you hear this (yelps) sound as it takes the impact and you can see this strange angry face appear suddenly out of the shimmering air that just then disperses again and you don't quite know where it is you can make a third strike now if you want did not appear to have any additional effect on the entity 19 still hits go ahead and roll the next attack eight damage again (whack) you backhand it with your third strike this time finding the edge of its face again and you see the chair right next to it tumble as it barely manages to catch itself and keep itself aloft nevertheless this strange invisible entity is still there holding its ground you look over at jarett jarett's currently trying to grab onto the creature and keep it grappled so yeah it's spattering on him (laughs) all right that ends grog's turn vax and tiberius you guys both get up to the edge of this room here that'll hit (laughter) 25 all right 15 just barely hits all right so as you rush over you stab downward you hear this (gurgle) sound as your blade comes down into whatever entity's there and your hand moves around as it struggles against the blade you pull it out grab your other dagger and then throw it in the air catch it slam it down again for that third strike and then pull back and stab a third time supple bear supplebear all right that ends your turn tiberius what are you doing that's about as far as you can get with your movement you currently do not have visual on either of them you're flying what's your fly speed you said that last time and we found out it was 40 i believe wasn't it you have a card and yet i find it faster it is 60 you're right yeah so you can go double you are now just coasting down the stairway all right go for it correct there's one over here that has grog and jarett flanking the other one has percy vax and trinket all around it that one's actually prone on the ground it's hard to see normally it's very hard to see now that it's swarmed you have visual of both entities whatever they are no you have not rested yet yeah you're still where you were when you came back are you doing this single-stream okay how much damage is it okay and what's the saving throw 17 okay jarett and vax have to make saving throws as well go ahead and make that jarett rolled an 18 and has high dex so yeah jarett makes his save that's half-damage for jarett all right so you take no damage because you're a rogue go ahead and roll damage that's 18 for one this one fails this one succeeds it's actually not prone they're immune to being prone so how much is that okay got you it would if it wasn't immune however as you arc down the ice blast comes through you can see vax manages to pull down to the ground and get out of the way in time jarett ducks out of the way and it blasts over hitting both these entities ice crackles around both their forms but then the forms shift out of it that ends your turn right there comes back to scanlan you are right there just entered the room behind everybody else over here no you just see currently these three down the hallway you can just see tiberius blast a bunch of ice arc in the air currently you see percy through this doorway right there yeah dimension door is your action d10 inspiration dice to you percy d10 yeah that brings it to the top of the combat round percy you're up first okay so go ahead and make your check that one shouldn't have changed no nine as you pull over your pepperbox you're like (ping) the actual barrel comes off and hits the ground and rolls off toward the back of the room the wraith is no longer on the ground by the way the entity actually upon looking is immune to being prone so we won't retcon anything but as you go to pull the barrel up you can see now the face is standing up before you okay so go ahead and roll with disadvantage with bad news 22 hits go ahead and roll damage 19 (gunshot) bad news goes off the sound is deafening in the room the echoing of the explosion through the stone walls i'm going to go ahead and have you roll a constitution saving throw vax both maybe constitution saving throw 15 okay you don't go deaf but your ears are ringing very hard the entity screams and then disperses okay so two more attacks or you have to use one to reload 27 hits go ahead and roll damage okay this time (gunshot) the shot goes off right by your head tiberius you're flying in the air and you look down and see him pull bad news out right beneath you and before you have a chance to react (gunshot) the flash of the muzzle just bursting forward a big plume of black powder smoke fills the air around you make a constitution saving throw okay you are considered deaf until the start of his next turn so that ends your turn percy all right next this entity that's hunter's marked is going to rush forward straight out of the grapple from jarett shifts right out of his hands is going to run forward and take the double attack against the prisoner that's a 19 plus six 25 hits and 15 hits as well takes 30 points of damage is currently unconscious punches him twice and you see the poor driver is knocked up into the ceiling falls down onto the bed and is half-laying off you see blood trickling down the front of his face his eyes open and slowly close that brings us to trinket's turn actually we're now going to roll trinket into your turn okay trinket stays there until it's your turn jarett is going to rush forward and come to this corner the crossbow is not much aid at this point reaches over and pulls out a short sword and lunges forward with the short sword yeah with disadvantage nine oh god rolls a 20 and a three great sorry jarett swinging through trying to pierce through the bars at this entity and can't seem to get any sort of attack to hit jarett got the door open he came through to try and grab the creature and as he tried to pull it back the creature sifted through his hands again to go ahead and attack the prisoner that ends jarett's turn vex it is now your turn yeah you can see about there it would give you visual on the entity he is yes so both attacks at disadvantage 15 hits just hits 16 also hits-- oh 16 damage all right including the additional hunter's mark 14 does not hit the arrow disappears in the back of the cell scattering and shattering against part of the stone wall correct so trinket rushes up but doesn't attack okay trinket just cheers you on (bear growl) cool that ends your turn keyleth okay so as you cast that it's going to attempt to make its save what's the dc on that and it fails with a 14 all right so you guys watch as she reaches her hand out the entire cell all of a sudden there's a burst of purplish light and these little dust-stars of purple glowing begin to drift down from the ceiling as they do they cling to whatever this form is and you can now see very clearly this invisible entity that is surrounded in these purple sparkles it looks humanoid from the torso up but its legs are shimmering and shifting around you now have a very clear look on it you've nullified its invisibility gives advantage as well yeah you guys now all have advantage on this entity okay so go ahead and roll for the healing word how much does he heal i think it's plus five whatever it is healing word yeah so it's plus six 12 got you okay desmond's eyes clarify for a second and he begins to breathe heavily still looking very wounded but conscious and prone across the bed as the entity that's hunter's marked is still looming over it bringing its fists up for another round to try and finish its job that ends your turn keyleth grog you're up as you rush up angrily make your strike that hits hits 17 also hits so roll damage three times as you rush up the bars open bringing the axe down on top of this now sparkling purple entity cool okay nice all righty so you run up (hammer strikes) hammer down a third time you can see its body being beaten around by the attack and you see the whispering of its wind around its lower body is starting to slow and it's looking like it's getting more sluggish but it's definitely still intent on its job that ends your turn grog vax you're up okay i will say you would normally get advantage because you're attacking it through the bars melee it disables it so it's just a straight attack you're having to fight it through prison bars with daggers which is difficult 14 misses unfortunately well it's the first attack you get on it would get it so even if you miss the first attack you can still get it with the second and third that does hit all right with that the first blade comes through and you try and get it through the bars and it gets nothing you pull back take the other dagger and swing through it falls too wide and you have to bring your arm back this time you can see after grog has slammed it with the hammer it falls the sparkles come towards the edge its slamming its back into the bars it's right there in front of you and you use that instance to go ahead and reach through the bars grab it by the throat and stab it repeatedly at which point its form disperses into wind around you you guys look over you see desmond is still on the bed eyes wide (panting) gets up on the bed and takes it what happened okay so go ahead and roll for the cure wounds heal on that all right awesome you add your wisdom modifier that's good to know all right cool all right desmond isn't eating it he's just holding it and still taking in what happened what was that look what was that thing make an arcana check if you rolled by accident you have to roll intentionally to take the score because if you were to accidentally roll really bad you'd be like that doesn't count i didn't actually roll total of 12 that's the thing you've seen these these entities are used by certain high-level arcane practitioners they can be summoned as certain spells they're air elemental-based in nature but they're generally known as invisible stalkers they're used as assassins that have a very sole single-minded purpose you get that based on recent events there's probably a good probability that was the source of this jarett at which point has put his hand against the wall and goes ugh i would recommend that next time you decide to put me on watch let me know if we're up against things that are invisible i apologize i was not prepared for such a foe to show up it's all right if i might ask what exactly are we up against here i would like also to consider possibly some changes made to our income as this suddenly turned from a general guarding job to going up against the denizens of the afterlife it's already been a very dangerous proposition very well i'm going to go ahead and make sure the rest of my team is alive if the pay is good yes you understand ugh okay talk to you in the morning i think a bit of rest is necessary and he makes his way up the stairs to the rest of the keep desmond at this point is still in shock and he starts absentmindedly eating the sandwich that you handed him is it safer there i told you they'd come for me i told you they would wipes the blood from the side of his face and looks at it yeah the individual responsible for the construction of the keep was lord riskel daxio which is an elven gentleman on the council that helped oversee the whole construction and helped you guys design it so still on the bed okay at this point desmond leans into you and quietly says in your ear vax he goes is where i'm sleeping going to be away from him he looks over towards percy you don't hear that it's whispered to vax make a persuasion roll takes another bite of the sandwich and packs it away in a little piece of cloth he had in a pocket puts it in there and you know you can still see as he brings his hand up you can see the blood streak against where the fingers were on the lower half of that hand strokes the edge of his chin and goes okay i trust you please please don't let them kill me okay i'm very tired takes you roughly another 20 minutes or so to bring it out of there fitting it through the door as you call out erwen eventually comes down hi yes tiberius you called it's quite early in the morning he has his night cap on and he's rubbing at his eyes right now it's about probably 630 in the morning or so it's just after sunrise you guys haven't even slept yet it's all right all right in the morning then master tiberius and he goes off to his bed to sleep okay make a stealth check all right so as the rest of you go to sleep-- okay so you guys are doing your setup there percy you're in your workshop go ahead and roll a perception check percy 17 okay you go about your work okay the materials that it requires you to do so are expensive you actually have to pay the cost of the gun and go ahead and make another check so go ahead and make another tinkering check and the cost of the pepperbox should be at the bottom of your-- should be half the cost it should say under the repair rules for a misfire 12 okay yeah so you take the rest of the morning unsleeping the dark bags under your eyes you manage to get the pepperbox back in working order right right but even so even though you slept it hasn't been very restful it's been technically enough to rest but your evening has been fraught with nightmares perpetually but your pepperbox is repaired and does cost you half the cost of the weapon cost to repair okay you guys rest through the rest of the morning waking up past noon probably about 200 in the afternoon you all gradually begin to come to consciousness make your way downstairs as you come downstairs you can already smell breakfast has been prepared you can see laina already has the meal set out for you and as you guys approach oh it's so nice of all of you to come down it was very interesting these very nice folks came by this morning and dropped off a whole bunch of food and fresh veggies and stuff makes for a great meal it was very nice of them food is served and she gives out the plates and gives you a smile i believe that's what it's called in some circles i'm trying a few new things no effect unfortunately there is a slight tingle but it's mostly a placebo (laughter) right understood good to know percy's down in his workshop as you guys are in the middle of your meal you hear clearing the stillness and quiet of the low munching-up (clears throat) and sitting at the table adjacent to you guys completely unnoticed in his entry is seeker asum arms crossed well obviously not that's why i'm here to have a conversation with the rest of you please continue to eat i don't mean to disturb you i've already eaten but i appreciate the offer what a wonderful meal well things have certainly gotten sticky haven't they well first and foremost i would like to thank you keyleth for clearing my head lord briarwood had locked me into some form of mental charm during my attempt to aid vax-- that's all right things are a bit mixed up it's hard to explain let's just say i have been clouded in my judgment for the past few days until you cleansed me i'm sorry to uphold the charade back in the palace i cannot say that is untrue but i accept your apology you may he's a hard person to gauge anyway you gathered over time that most of his work deals in a network of spies and the gathering of information across all of tal'dorei so he is very well-trained to hide the essence of his true nature and the intent hard to read but he seems pleasant as he's been and given the circumstances nevertheless i accept your apology and i apologize for having upheld the charade during the council meeting but i had to keep up appearances so as not to cause any sort of stir at the time i fear based on my observations since that our very own sovereign also fell to the same charm i did and has been clouded since the dinner the night before he's been through quite a bit and while he's a resolute and a very good man i would say that he is predisposed to outer influence from those that are quite strong-willed under those conditions the room filled with guards that were all intent against keeping you at bay should you have made any attempt to try and cleanse him as well during that time i think you all would have wound up in prison or worse because when you're under this influence to speak against the proposed ally of the charm is to draw a line i wish to stay in his good graces because that would enable us a much better chance of getting you close enough to him to absolve him of this charm if i was to reveal this instantaneously in the presence of the entire council i fear that might have put me in the same court of disfavor as you and lost any future chance of expelling this influence best i can gather most of the council is not as well-- how do i put it not used to business with vox machina allura seems to be of clear mind as she is very powerfully protected against such influences and did not have any immediate interaction with the briarwoods during that dinner i fear the intent was on the sovereign himself same way they corrupted me apparently it takes naught but a glance i think we have something in common there are a few options at our disposal you could continue to work to clear your name during his distraction southward if you have some idea as to how we could get close enough to him to absolve him of this now that would leave the risk of should anything go poorly being poked with many spear holes if you're confident that may be more of a mission for the quieter of your bunch should they be a little more intelligent with their actions going forward i will say based on recent circumstances he is very careful and defensive honestly i have no idea i think this plan if successful is quite inspired however failure would probably end in the immediate incarceration and/or death of both individuals involved public execution does not befit the country-wide name of vox machina if you were to fail if you were to succeed that would be the most direct route between two points as far as i know yes if that's the case then perhaps her current power is not as strong in the council when regarding you but she is still a member of the council should she not be immediately affiliated with you for her purposes this is up to you whatever you choose to do if it requires my aid i will give it a day before i have to leave my next intent is to head-- well i wish to go past the eastern curtain set up by whitestone into wildemount i have spent the better part of the past day since the cleansing seeking all records of the briarwoods and their doings there was a period of about eight years in which there is no public record of their goings-on it appears that most records that deal with their involvement in wildemount and whatever homestead gave them their title lord and lady briarwood has all been but erased so i intend to go to the source wildemount itself and research this will take me some time of course sooner the better i was thinking tomorrow percy is not even here percy is down in the workshop okay as you come around the corner percy is currently leaning up against the side of the wall listening in to the conversation well that depends if you have strong defenses and the enemy has no means of entering then he will be safer here the palace itself is a very well-protected area however there currently is an open invitation into the palace and if the essence of our enemy is as i think it is then they can enter whenever they like he's going to wildemount the kingdom that they're originally from the continent to the far east i'm trying to find as much information to incriminate them in case whatever you're attempting does not work i have already made arrangements for travel i could try but depends on what you need me here for so that would be a way to clear your name and clear his head sure you can go ahead and roll a d20 is there anything you're holding back he seems clear as day telling the honest truth anyway asum says my getting to wildemount is not easy nor is it safe i cannot linger for long maybe a few days that depends on if i even return every spy i've sent to seek information on the briarwoods or to whitestone has not come back okay how many of those do you have left by the way my journey requires the utmost of silence speed stealth and i mean no offense to your entourage but i think i can do this alone and should however this journey may take me two weeks a month many months-- i do not know i'm doing this just in case whatever you're choosing to do fails at least if vox machina falls in this i can come back with proof enough to try and once the army has been gathered perhaps we can rally all of emon against whitestone i can try my best make a persuasion roll regardless you have to make a choice soon i cannot dilly-dally i'll take your band yes he takes the wooden band and puts it around his arm and says if this will put you at ease i'll take it i could get you in the door but i could not escort you to that room that would put myself in extreme danger and the entirety of our mission (laughs) i can do that quite well yes vengeance a voice whispers in your ear percy no one hears this vengeance i mean he looks shaken and fucked up yeah he's obviously had a horrible few days then it is settled i'll be on my way certainly three days and i'll be off on my side of the mission very well yes and he walks out walks with you and as you all scatter percy as you walk out the same voice creeps into your ear yes now as you step out with seeker asum who now has a bit of haste to his step arms crossed looking around so you wish to speak with me i am i can be (sighs) we'll go over what you know and perhaps there are a few tricks that i can teach you in the three days i have i can't guarantee that it'll be extremely changing as that's a very short time to train over what i've learned over a lifetime but i can certainly attempt i require your concentration for those days though before i leave all right meet me at the morrow crack of dawn i'll be at the front of your keep very well and he heads off outside of the keep the rest of you what are you doing about 300 400 in the afternoon now it's part of the keep yeah oh you mean the actual temple you went to that is inside the city yes you can go into the city you just can't get to the cloudtop district tiberius loves shopping all right we'll go ahead and take a quick break we'll be back in five minutes keep it a stringent break guys yes we'll try to keep the errands pretty concise so we can keep on schedule yeah so it's like use this break to conjecture exactly what you want to do all right guys we'll see you back here in five minutes [break] okay go ahead and make a tinkering check for your ammunition i would say the tinkering the mechanisms involved would be so far beyond your understanding as a druid even just metalwork in general you can cheer him on but would not be able to assist him with it 24 okay you manage to produce 25 rounds for your pepperbox and ten rounds for the bad news used that to repair his pepperbox roll for the secondary construction smoke bombs 11 you take a better part of two days attempting to get these to work and most of your materials are ruined unfortunately you manage to come out with it with and i want you to write this down smoke bomb question mark it may function we will see upon use but you have one at your disposal that is questionable however for the cost of the ammunition and the cost of the smoke bomb's construction already that comes to about i'd say 75 gold pieces so mark that off and you're attempting to make you're attempting to make based on what you told me an archimedes death ray you could to be functional with the materials that are at your disposal it's going to be very large and hard to move you spend the remainder of this week of preparation go ahead and roll your tinkering check this is going to cost you in materials what do you want to do okay go for it all right so the actual materials for this-- i know it's copper but the actual dodecahedron that's involved the mirrors the lenses the whole thing in order to be of the scale and quality to even make it even remotely functional all of it for the extremely high quality and some of it custom-made within the first couple days within this with a rush order i'd say the total cost is going to come to about 1200 gold pieces the actual focal lens is about this big the whole construct can be carried by two people of the lens itself this is the radius of the lens i mean even when it's collapsed it can be carried by one person but it's still a heavy mechanism i'd say it's about two and a half feet in diameter he's already agreed go ahead and roll 22 through the materials and the construct of it you get partway through the final stages of it and as you're tightening one of the sections all of a sudden there's a (cracking) sound your whole body freezes as you glance over the lens itself has a giant crack through it for the construct for this one there was a focusing lens that is part of what the initial blast otherwise there wouldn't be a point of actually projecting a ray from there's all different sorts of construction based on this one's the one we're going on here or if you can say the center of it is a gem but regardless the tinkering roll was not high enough to construct the device sorry it's not something you can repair the entire piece is constructed from a solid piece you could attempt to pickaxe comes to four gold pieces for the two of those you got them make a secondary tinkering check 22 this time you go back and as you're tightening it the actual metal housing of the device ends up bending in a way that both cracks the gem and causes the frame itself to be dented to the point where the beam will be imperfect this is a very hard thing that you've come up with in your mind that has not been constructed before and the level of difficulty to create this is very difficult it does not cost you additional money thanks to the mending wheel but right now the entire device looks like to continue it's going to take more time and money to construct it i'd say about half the cost an additional 600 two more days you agreed upon eight so we'd be pushing about seven then unfortunately-- what's your intellect working on the device a third time you get it right to the point where you think it could work and you go to set it up and as you do you find that the light focuses in a way that actually slowly melts the copper on the outside of the housing of the device and it begins to melt onto itself and you have to pull it out of the light this design is beyond your grasp right now you're inventing something that takes quite a lot of time to eventually perfect that's been your guys' week okay you bought your pickaxe and your shovel cool vex what are you doing you're training okay 20 technically because tiberius requested ten those will cost you a total of two gold make an investigation check 13 asking around the town holy arrows that is an enchantment they're pricey and they don't appear to be anywhere in the major shops even shops like gilmore's that they specialize in it's usually a special order-type thing holy water flasks can be purchased at 20 gold apiece holy oil as opposed to the holy water well holy oil is a more expensive version holy water is a one-use holy oil can be applied to a weapon a cluster of ten if that's what you wanted would weigh about five pounds but they're relatively light those are 100 gold apiece yeah tristan is here because i have to yes i inspected you is that healing well by the way he inspects the wounds on the side of your neck and he steps away goes back disappears for a minute comes back and he's holding in a chain around his neck-- it's seen some years of use but still clean and very well kept an identical holy symbol of sarenrae as the one that pike keeps around her neck he hands it over and puts it over your head may she keep you safe and bring your soul to redemption as it should pats you on the cheek as it should you are stopped at the edge of the cloudtop district the guards see you as you approach and block the doorway and say we're sorry but vox machina has been given no passage into the cloudtop district at this time that's certainly unfortunate isn't it both the guards look at each other and laugh for a second piss off okay make a perception check 17 okay keeping an eye out you do eventually come across a boy that looks about his age late teens maybe early twenties comes by and gathers a little bit of meat and rushes off and you stop him jameson yeah can i help you i've really got to get home with this make a deception check 15 gives you a look over and goes i'm certain you've given him silver but kynan's been gone for the better part of a week i don't know he just told us all he was off to find his destiny or some sort of bullshit like that he's always had his head in the clouds that one no kept to himself mostly sorry i wish i could be more of a service if i see him where should i send him (clattering) well i'll pass that along good day and he hurries off to continue with his errand is that your last errand scanlan yeah gilmore's in the city he's not in the cloudtop so you have access to him still here we go okay asking around there are no potions for it but there is a scroll of hallow available and i will say that comes to roughly 6000 gold pieces for the scroll of hallow 6000 for the hallow scroll and for the spirit guardian you said it was 4th-level that one is 2000 gold spirit guardians is level three actually not level four that makes it a lot cheaper that is 600 gold if you have a scroll you can yeah it has a chance of failing 600 gold pieces there's only one available so you mark that down okay remembering that you have spoken to karin before which is the renowned custom blacksmith in emon you speak with her a chainmail half coif around the neck there is relatively inexpensive it's a partial piece of armor she looks at some scrap chainmail on the side and is like i'd be more than happy to use that for it it shouldn't me take more than an hour two maybe at most okay (laughs) all right seven of those i'd say for the whole seven it'd put you at 100 gold because it's custom orders seven of those all righty she awkwardly judges and turns that request down she's uncomfortable with that okay so you got that yes just a second there tiberius gilmore unfortunately is in westruun currently still overseeing the construction of his expansion there that would be i can't find my updated npc sheet do you remember what her name was sherri thank you i was like shelby no sherri sherri is there greeting you that would probably be me she takes it if you're requesting identification of a magical item that is a service we charge 125 gold pieces per enchantment identified all right she takes it she steps inside sets it on the counter she starts going through her books and starts looking at it and holding it for a second and doing a full inspection of it based on the enchantment on this device it's very crude in construction and the enchantment is in an arcane offshoot of language i'm not very familiar with but it appears it is a guard from some sort of a mental influence if worn it would give you a stronger resistance against things that would attempt to peer into your mind yes so essentially what it would do is it would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws against magic spells it would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws against magical effects she noticeably blushes and goes well send mine back if you wouldn't mind i've got work to do and she rushes off all right now tiberius okay did you pay for it already you paid up front okay so you get the canteen the explanation is the enchantment of the actual water creation itself is separate than the holy enchantment that has been attached to it the holy enchantment is not very powerful because it is an enchanted item how it functions is the first burst per day that you use of the water does an additional 1d6 radiant damage that's it but any additional after that is just water basically whatever water is immediately contained within it at the start of the day is considered blessed once that's expelled all the rest that it creates-- because it's pulling it out of the elemental plane of water that's how it's continuously projecting it the rest of it runs straight through so it doesn't have a chance to even absorb the blessing with (laughs) so what enchantment do you want do you want to just do an additional-- what do you want it to be just a magical weapon okay just a general plus-one magical weapon okay that would take about-- let me double-check the rarity here that would run you approximately 700 gold to create it as a plus-one magical item would take one mage a week to do it okay so for the week it takes you pay 700 gold pieces your quarterstaff with a couple of daggers tied to the end is now considered a plus-one magical weapon (laughter) unfortunately the thing is an enchantment cannot be progressively enhanced you would have to disenchant and then re-enchant the entire thing no they can enchant the item with it but it would be the cost of basically re-enchanting the item that would cost approximately 25000 gold pieces and it would take the better part of a year a plus-two ring of protection is a very powerful item that you even acquired one earlier was great luck the ring of spell storing the ring of spell storing that's its enchantment there is no more powerful version of the ring of spell storing if you wanted to attempt to do that yourself on your own time you could that will cost you upward 60000 gold pieces and about a year it's good to ask these things i'll say throughout the week 'cause you've taught lockheed a lot of things back to back you can't cram everything in there in the three to four days and like you learn everything because you've already taught lockheed one thing this week roll for a second thing you want to teach lockheed sure i'll give you advantage on that roll advantage go for it yeah you can roll several beard checks 43 it starts filling in nope 16 okay so by the time the week comes to an end the other side of your beard has finally filled in and you are back to a full beard grog so yeah that succeeds it takes you a few days to get it though but what do you want to teach lockheed a very important thing to teach a creature so lockheed has learned to be quiet good anything else there are plenty of mirrors out there there are general stores that sell them all over okay i misunderstood yeah you could've had them custom made if they weren't out there but they have mirrors of that size available there aren't that many mirrors in the city they're five gold apiece and of what is currently available for purchase you may be able to acquire about 35 mirrors and you'll clean out most of the places that will stop selling them to you yeah four by four so there you go four by four okay 35 times five so we're looking at 175 gold keyleth's been working with percy this whole time it's taken the entire week for him you said you were assisting him i thought you said you were still going to help cheer him on okay then no worries then yeah you're available the enchantment of an arrow to do that is the use of a fog spell there is no way to infuse a fog spell with holy water no sure make a roll plus arcana 24 okay after spending approximately 500 gold in materials the enchantment fails both spells fizzled you lost 500 gold but now you know probably can't combine two spells into a single enchantment you go towards the cloudtop district and the guards stop you again all right how many sleep bolts okay i will say for each arrow it will cost you 600 gold and will take you six days to do per arrow yes it's one day per 100 gold of an enchantment which is even me making it higher than the book says it should take you four times that you want to hire a mage so three and a half days and it cost you 1200 gold for a single sleep bolt okay so you've done all of your shopping in one day and spent the rest of the week doing those all right so there we go you're broke and you have two sleep bolts on your person keyleth okay that comes to-- alchemist supplies 50 gold not enchanted yo it's magic give me all the magic a level two healing potion a greater healing potion the materials involved in creating that will come to i'd say about 400 apiece and you'd have time to create two it's about four days per potion to purchase they cost about 500 to 600 she's getting a discount because she's making it herself yes it's your first time doing it they'll probably get cheaper over time as you get better at it it's a greater healing so for each one you make roll a d20 and add five okay then yeah you successfully create the potion no issue a daylight scroll what level spell is that third that'll cost you about i'd say 600 gold pieces it'll take you six days you don't have time you could pay more to have somebody else help you make one if you wanted to you know that upon throwing the holy water it would shatter it would create a fog but the holy water itself would just affect the creature you threw it at you'd be able to blend the two enchantments they don't necessarily mix the fog itself is not created from the water it's created from the glass that you're enchanting you have a couple of flasks of holy water it's a whole different thing daylight that's more of a scroll thing okay that will cost you-- i'll put it at 500 gold pieces and that'll take you five days okay roll another d20 plus five all right you feel the fog enchantment take shape in the glass vial it seems relatively unstable you gather that this glass was not meant to contain an enchantment from the get-go you somehow manage to make it function but you have to be very careful with that vial who knows what'll happen if it actually is thrown it's a fog-enchanted vial of holy water you can write it down that way if you'd like what was once holy-- (laughter) okay you give all the chainmail okay (laughs) it takes much convincing but nevertheless they acquiesce to your request being the boss all right anything else the what lord daxio you mean what about him i will do this with my life do not worry very generous and i think they'll be very happy to find this thank you very much very well i will do this thank you okay erwen goes all right sir and he wanders off about an hour later erwen returns and says i'm sorry they would not allow me into the central district i do not have the proper papers to pass within i mentioned that i worked for you and they told me i was not to enter go ahead and roll a d20 adding your wisdom modifier make it with advantage because asum is a very good teacher 17 okay (laughs) is that how this works all right so talking with asum he works with you for a bit and teaches you the ranger ability skirmisher's stealth so if you start one of your turns hidden from a creature you can then as a bonus action at the end of your turn make another stealth check to remain hidden from them you essentially can dive between areas and still be hidden so yeah we'll go over the details of it after the game essentially you learn a new ranger ability from seeker asum all right tiberius what do you want to do all right all right as the week comes to a close eventually a note appears before you tiberius within your magical room (fluttering) it reads tiberius child i understand your request however you are fresh to these political matters and as the young one prone to jump at the sight of a shadow i would need some very heavy proof to invoke wartime which if i might add is not your jurisdiction but my own should you wish to bring this to my attention you are welcome to but you have but one chance before i set aside this intrusion to my work time as mere poppycock (laughter) erwen all right the note is left with erwen yes of course of course i don't have a drink yeah the elemental gives you an acknowledgment and speaks back in its own tongue the equivalent of for my time here i serve for my time here i serve is essentially the essence of what you get from him for my time here i serve all right well percy said the turst fields the turst fields you do know some of you may have passed by them they are to the east northeast area of westruun on the eastern side of the continent it's about four and a half days' travel horseback you have four horses and you technically have the teleportation sigil for westruun westruun's most of the way across the continent it's about a day's ride out from westruun it would shave about three days off your journey the turst fields are a farming community that takes care of a lot of the eastern side they're not really an extension of westruun but it's one of the closest cities and they do a lot of food trade up into whitestone or did previously okay tiberius you go ahead and cast teleportation circle now you cast circle of teleportation yep and the circle appears you guys rush through it you do not have your horses with you because they would not be able to travel through the teleportation circle with you however you could probably procure some while you're in westruun in doing that you guys for the case of brevity on this-- we've been missing that for a lot of this session we'll say the total gold to purchase horses for the whole party-- you would've go ahead and make a persuasion roll 21 okay yeah would put you at about we'll say because you are renowned in this area and you've helped westruun helped them during the winter's crest festival the year before using that discount you manage to procure everyone's horses including your warhorse for 210 gold which is a pretty decent discount you can yeah you have two paths you have the path into the center of the parchwood woods that leads up into the valley of the alabaster sierras that surround it that is the direct route to whitestone that leads through the main pathway the forest to the front of the city there's also the alabaster sierras themselves which surround that peninsula that extends into the northern part of the continent they are very tall fjord-like craggy mountain ranges up against the sea along the edge they're a little more treacherous but a little more out of the way a backdoor route so you guys choose which route you want to take percy you are aware that here have been problems in the past with various mountain-faring giants that lived north of whitestone that occasionally would wander too far south they mostly kept to themselves but occasionally they had some crossover there were some scuffles here and there so you guys are deciding to take the alabaster sierras you guys head out from westruun it takes about a day's worth of travel you stop in the turst fields it's a small farming community you ask around for a bit most of the folks there say that they haven't had much trade or communication with whitestone like they used to they do still provide crops and such but they don't allow anyone past into the actual forest they trade at the boundary created by the forest still pay gold but it seems to be more enclosed scenario but very few folks there seem to question it business as usual is still left within turst fields make your way northward to the bottom of the alabaster sierras and as you begin heading up the outskirts of this mountain range you do notice that the mountains are extremely high in altitude there's a perpetual climb at nearly a 40-degree angle as you continue upward further and further and further the drop-off at the edge of the cliff is 1000 to 2000 feet at times straight down into the ocean or rocks below there are paths worn up here it has been used as travel before although you're uncertain as to how recently it may have been traversed occasionally the wind picks up and you have to steel yourself push yourself against the side the path thankfully is maybe 15 20 sometimes 30 feet in width it's not too much where you're being forced against the edge but it's enough to be aware of the danger of the circumstance you guys are heading up i'd say about half a day's travel it's about 200 in the afternoon also you can tell there are slight outcroppings a few hundred feet down to the bottom a few bits of stone that jut out from the side you can see small nests or bushes that have taken root on those side areas the rock itself of this mountain range is unusually unnaturally white the actual rock that forms this entire region is almost a glowing quartz-like texture there are parts that are almost translucent there are parts that are very milky white number one you can now understand as to partially why the area is called whitestone the town nearby and you've heard mention from percy in the past of the large quarries here that mine the stone for various uses and export it throughout all of tal'dorei that's where a large portion of the town was built around that trade at the beginning of its construction eventually you come to a point where there is a falloff on the path where the erosion or some sort of large impact of the side caused the path to fall into a scooped crevasse that is a smooth fall down the side there is no way across other than a large sea salt air-rotted rope bridge that goes across about a hundred feet you see it rocking (creaking) with the wind no the bridge can be crossed it looks a little rickety it's not terrible or frightening but it's been there for a while and you can tell from the color of the rope-- a hundred feet go ahead and make an investigation check okay looking at it i mean the anchors are pretty solid in the stonework there's no looseness to their element the rope itself is taut and seems to have serviced long enough there are no signs of extreme wear other than just time and weather all right are you taking your horse with you making your way across you get halfway across the bridge there's a creaking sound and slight movement as the wind picks up at times and you (creaking) make an intelligence check roll and add your intelligence modifier best you can tell grog looks like a big guy okay you make the rest of your way across no issue the rope bridge carries your weight all the way there's a couple of small cliffside trees that grow off in strange twisting bonsai tree-like branches that stick off they're pretty sturdy secret ranger knot well played (laughter) spooks you for a second you hold on and you make your way across you guys are now on the other side you're holding onto everyone's horses left behind you cast fly on trinket-- so you get on trinket's back so who's going across now okay you make it across no problem you're light enough and able to guide the movement of the bridge the physical condition of the bridge there is no actual visible point that is-- the vines reach around and wrap around the edges of the wood slats and the rope handholds and it seems to be pretty well-held on that side cool you make it across without a problem yeah that would be 12 seconds which will be enough time so as you're coasting over with trinket floating (bear sounds) you turn around and cast telekinesis grog all of a sudden you're lifted up and held aloft you look down over yourself waving your hands instinctually looking down you can see a 600 700 foot drop before the rock comes to a point which would probably splinter or crush anyone who fell into it and then is pushed out to the ocean so it's a little scary but you start flailing about as you're being pulled across by tiberius eventually trinket comes lands on the other side safely you guide grog over down onto his feet safe and sound okay cool all righty the path pinches a little bit tighter as you go across about a ten foot width and you guys begin pulling across there's a sudden large gust of sea air blows in as you guys go ahead and buckle down to hold on i'd like you all to roll an athletics check you have advantage on it that's true yeah all right as you guys are holding tight both scanlan and vax are trying to grab something holding onto rocks but before they can get enough they're both so small it pushes them out it's three seconds oh passed since the bridge about five six minutes you can catch one of them because the spell has to be directed they're both being dragged by the wind off the side of the cliff you can see them grabbing the ground vax is being pulled off the side as scanlan is actually lifted off his feet you grab vax and hold him in place as you reach out and grab vax by the arms and pull him back onto-- you were fine okay then you're being held aloft by tiberius' telekinesis concentrating scanlan has fallen out of view okay it's all right go ahead and make an attack roll with your grasping vine this is to aim the vine as he falls 19 not a problem the vine grabs scanlan and pulls him back and holds him as the wind slowly dies down the wind dies down you guys now begin pushing yourselves close to the edge of this pathway up the side of this seaside cliff it doesn't seem to deviate much beyond that 15-foot width now which puts you all at general unease as the sun's getting closer and closer to setting you're making your way around the crest you've been traveling this mountain range for a good number of hours now you're at a decent height you're on foot a good distance inside the alabaster sierra mountain range perception check everyone three two one okay those of you with a higher perception than 20 on this roll as you pull along you hear this echoing sound this (bird-like sounds) in the distance the wind's carrying it as it's blowing past you go ahead and make an intelligence check you go ahead and make a nature check it is birdish in nature but it sounds too guttural and too articulate to be a bird there is enough of-- you notice there's a language of the chittering that is bird-like but there is actual voice you recall that there are various creatures that make the cliffsides home one of the ones that are more obnoxious that some of the earlier traders of whitestone had problems with making this path for mining were clusters of harpies you glance over as you guys are having this conversation behind you you can see in the distance from where you were a couple of these dark shapes swooping down you see a cluster of about four or five of these harpies diving okay it has faded since then yeah you're still on the path and you look back from where you came from yeah a sheer cliff okay as you're concentrating on this eventually keyleth begins to focus and over the next minute or so she begins to push a cavern okay as this is happening you can see the harpies have definitely found some sort of prey they're distracted as they're slowly tearing apart what you gather are the horses you left behind yeah good news is they're distracted bad news is they're probably not going to be there when you come back over the next few minutes or so keyleth you've pushed a good ten by 15-foot cavern into the side of this wall that didn't previously exist you guys are able to step out of the light as the sun's starting to disappear over the mountain range the cliffkeep which you can see in the distance across this channel now there's a channel of water between the two sure go ahead and make a stealth check okay you take the next 15 minutes or so finding what nearby pieces of brush you can and rocks that have been loosely around the area and you start setting up this pattern of them that closes off some of the entrance from the smooth opening that keyleth had created it takes a little ingenuity because it's just a rock opening and there isn't a whole lot of brush and things around but you feel you've managed to mask it to the point that to a distant eye it would be hard to see that there is an actual cavern there at this point the sun has set night has come in and you guys are sitting within this cavern hearing the distant sound of the ocean waves crashing against the bottom of these cliffside coastal fjords all right a fire is made okay tiberius forms a relatively useful and effective campfire within this cave you can yes do be aware the holy oil will only last about a day it's one of those things where if you dip it now and leave it over time it'll just either evaporate or drip off of the arrow (bear groaning) trinket at first just haplessly pushes you away but recognizes your scent and lets you okay i mean what book would you be researching this in the researcher ability is that you can go to places of research and find books you don't really keep a tome of all knowledge with you the next time you find a town or you're in town then you can use that ability to research in advance do you guys all rest for the evening laura and okay okay you guys continue your business for the evening okay go ahead and make a perception check okay you are keeping relatively low and are able to overhear their conversation go ahead and make an insight check 17 roll a d20 and add your charisma modifier best you can tell he's seeming honest and sharing open-hearted to you you feel like you've really gotten to the core truth of what percy's about you feel like you've gotten to the core and truth of what percy's about and perhaps your questioning this has upset him and you feel like maybe you've pushed this a little too far okay you guys through your turns the evening goes by uneventful morning comes to you you can hear the distant caws of seagulls waking you up as the heat from the morning sun begins to eventually hit this side of the cave since you're on this side of the mountain by the time you wake up you realize the hour's probably a little bit past noon you gather you probably have about a day's worth of travel and you'll be able to make your way down into the ravine from here you've come up quite a bit of the mountain range okay you guys gather outside of the cavern and head up continuing along this path eventually you do notice that the path becomes broken and too steep to continue it actually falls and tumbles down into this long sliding ravine there is a slight rockslide trail that you could climb up and over and it looks like there is a separate ravine or a separation where the two mountains join that could possibly be traversed but continuing on the seaside path is not going to work it does bring you inward towards-- maybe a little further south than you would have wanted to for optimal backdoor entrance into whitestone but it's about your only path you would have had no reason to walk this path you've heard about it you know of this side of the mountain range but based on your history there's no reason you would have come here everyone make a stealth check by the way just so we're aware of what your stealth rolls are with the pass without a trace okay 27 with the ten that's a pretty good spread so you guys you've hit the edge of the path are you heading up the rockslide trail okay you all one by one begin to climb over the trail and some rocks tumble loose beneath your feet grasp and you help each other get to the very top (laughs) that's adorable (laughter) so you all eventually manage to make it over the top of the rockslide trail and eventually it leads you to where these two large mountains come together and there is a small path that leads between it winds and travels downward you can see bits of the rock have fallen and crumbled and there are small boulders and such that just over time and through erosion have tumbled down this ravine to start filling it with occasional chunks of stone you begin walking through this ravine for another good 45 minutes to an hour keeping a keen eye out basically you guys have been traveling up the side of the coast you've now turned inward over the mountain range to head down into the valley of whitestone you are currently just now heading up through the mountain range inwards towards the mountain there's no river here it's just stone that comes together for a pathway in between this is where two large peaks of the mountains basically come to join at the bottom no the river is actually inside the valley and to the south of whitestone so pressing down i would like you all to roll a perception check one one 20 20 okay as all of you guys are charging forward both vex and vax you hear this slight noise of a couple rocks (clattering) in the ravine behind you you both turn and look and for a split second you swear you see between some of the rocks and paths of jagged stone that mark the walls of this ravine you see a quick blur of blue that vanishes behind a higher platform above you a large blur of blue just disappears behind one of the outcroppings that's blocking your view of higher up the ravine okay you guys prepare for a second and as you're all paying attention you guys also see another shift of blue (whoosh) go across the way and this time you see it's something large and blue that moves across the stone and goes into a small cavern that looks about 25 feet up the way that's just past your visual range from this low in the ravine it moved very quickly and for a split second you could see it appeared to be-- the way it moved was almost serpentine like (whoosh) and vanished inside you swear you saw limbs though it wasn't a giant snake there was something attached to it what did you roll 24 you've heard of various lizard-like creatures that grow to large sizes usually those fall into the realm of dragons and such the color blue though is uncommon unless it were a blue dragon however the motion of this creature does not seem to necessarily be the territory of a blue dragon it's hard to point exactly what this is but you do know it's probably something in the serpentine-type magical realm go ahead and make a history check nine unfortunately nothing of this type has come across you if it has it's been too long and you've forgotten it there are a number of dangerous things that exist in these mountains yeah they're easy to find there's like some that are this big some that are larger they're really heavy make an athletics check (whoosh) you release the rock (impact) it skids to a halt as it does you can see suddenly over the course (whoosh) something very quickly move and it's a head it's a snout you see it's probably a good six seven-foot wide a giant lizard-like toothy jaw blue scales against it with large kind of horned ridges across the back of its head and its claws (clacking) on the edge looks down looks down at the rest of you rears back it just withdrew over the edge okay as you begin casting and finish the spell as the sphere appears-- at which point you now see a large blue blur (whoosh) dart off of the cliffside into the air (impact noise) and skidding right in front of you guys blocking off the side of the ravine you guys were running towards you can now see it a huge elongated serpentine body covered in blue scales and horns you can see what looks to be six to eight arms and a series of legs all across its long snakelike torso as it looks it snarls at you all (snarls) and you see sparks of energy electricity (sparking noises) in its jaw (growls roars) and that's where we're going it end tonight (yelling) i can because it's 1030 we can keep going if you guys want to stay long it's thursday night but to give you a little perspective that is what essentially you'd be facing (loud reactions)
