000904018 --> 000906537 let's jump in to tonight's episode of critical role 000912241 --> 000915877 [tv static click] 000915877 --> 001033127 [groovy critical role theme] 001033909 --> 001035978 oh i had two noses there we go that's much better thank you sam for that nightmare fuel 001044856 --> 001045969 all right last we left off the mighty nein had allied themselves with captain avantika of the 001057230 --> 001103378 squalleater a pirate making her way through the swavain islands in search of ways to unlock this 001103378 --> 001109871 entity that she was fanatically obsessed with this uk'otoa which was revealed to be the patron 001109871 --> 001119187 to fjord's abilities after retrieving one of these sought-after orbs from this long-reused 001119187 --> 001125672 temple by the snake folk on the island and apparently unlocking one of these seals you made 001125672 --> 001131978 your way back to darktow on her ship did a bit of piracy arrived were introduced to the plank 001131978 --> 001139901 king who looks over the revelry the band of pirates that helm this side pardon me of the 001139901 --> 001147553 lucidian ocean you then decided to have a plan to break into the squalleater at night while everyone 001147553 --> 001153070 was at rest or some of you at rest some were distracting the captain in doing so you managed 001153070 --> 001159387 to uncover a well-hidden journal of avantika that was written in some sort of a cipher 001159387 --> 001200456 kind of like the journal didn't quite look like that but artistic interpretation your 001207440 --> 001217931 entrance was solid your exit left a couple of signs of disturbance but nothing implicating you 001217931 --> 001223971 returned and through the evening and the luck of a ridiculous roll you managed to via caleb 001223971 --> 001230575 break the cipher on it after knowing what information was there through your spell and 001230575 --> 001236973 write a cipher to allow anybody to read the contents of this journal and see what's within 001236973 --> 001243682 however the morning in which you awoke you discovered that the crew at least had seemed to 001243682 --> 001249754 have noticed all these strange events through the night the ransacked chamber pointed to some 001249754 --> 001257601 tomfoolery you were all asked to make your way to the shipyard to meet with avantika and the crew on 001257601 --> 001304878 the squalleater with not far behind you on the docks the rest of the crew of the mistake being 001304878 --> 001312922 brought as well upon you stepping up and encountering this moment of tension it seems 001312922 --> 001322929 that through vera's glance through some form of divination magic while some people have guarding 001322929 --> 001331032 objects or items against themselves being sought through divination certain objects in pockets are 001331032 --> 001339147 not free of it they glanced over in caleb's direction and in that moment you cast wall of 001339147 --> 001349280 fire before we get too far into this i need you to place your wall of fire for me please on this battlefield 001349280 --> 001351049 okay while you're doing this i'm going to put this up there now the announcements are complete 001423250 --> 001428125 yeah best you can 001432324 --> 001433980 oh you're creating a u 001437956 --> 001439045 okay 001444548 --> 001446365 this is it this is the entire thing 001455471 --> 001456372 okay we'll place it here 001504889 --> 001509462 we'll say that he is currently-- 001510685 --> 001510953 that was amazing 001527311 --> 001530033 all righty meticulous placement be damned 001535057 --> 001537572 yeah 001538659 --> 001540845 it's fine liam leave it leave it alone you've lost miniature privileges 001547785 --> 001552276 in the final moment-- we lost one of them up top too 001557677 --> 001604735 sure that'll do 001609384 --> 001612533 perfect now meticulously carefully placed to not waste anyone's time at that moment you 001630638 --> 001636894 all noticing this moment of tension there's a flash from caleb's hands figures their eyes dart 001636894 --> 001644126 in his direction as he finishes releasing his arms and firing out of the actual deck of the ship you 001644126 --> 001651739 see a 20-foot tall high wall of roaring flame and fire burn around in a u-shape encompassing the 001651739 --> 001655628 exterior you can feel the heat on you but it's not so intense as to hurt however i need you to 001655628 --> 001657787 roll damage 001657787 --> 001659799 correct that's 5d8 fire damage if you don't mind 001702979 --> 001704639 that's a success for the dwarf over there he takes-- 001731631 --> 001734059 that's a shame eight damage for him for bouldergut that is a failure 001740745 --> 001745196 mm-hmm 17 for bouldergut to the guy it got put on directly that's a failure on his point he 001754036 --> 001759650 takes a full 17 points of damage the guy who's guarding the other plank there that's a failure 001759650 --> 001809339 on him he takes 17 avantika fails with a natural one avantika takes a full 17 then we have the 001809339 --> 001817768 guy over there he fails with a three he takes another 17 then vera rolls a natural 20 vera's 001817768 --> 001825283 right there vera takes eight now that the wall of fire is in place crackling around you 001825283 --> 001831287 blackening the surface of the deck the roaring of its sound as it (whooshing) roll initiative please 001831287 --> 001835997 i pre-rolled initiative for the guys here to keep it going 25 to 20 001845591 --> 001850623 all right 20 to 15 anybody 001859479 --> 001901803 we have jester and yasha 001906883 --> 001908724 15 to ten 001913440 --> 001914672 fjord at 11 001920424 --> 001923216 all right ten to five 001929424 --> 001930985 that's all right top of the combat round as the flames are crackling around you hear 001955873 --> 002000554 screams from crewmen that are too close and having to pull back and someone starts shouting fire 002000554 --> 002005321 off to the side from this side of the docks beau you're up first what are you doing 002005321 --> 002006847 isn't it though that's fine that'll work 002045575 --> 002048902 no only an action 002051233 --> 002053527 i'll say running up to him and then going give me the book him rummaging through it or 002058534 --> 002101920 you helping him rummage through and grab it i'll consider that an action because that takes a few 002101920 --> 002109983 seconds to do it's not something he had ready you've moved 15 feet to get over there and then 002109983 --> 002111044 your action 002111044 --> 002112781 jester was right next to you when you started 002115505 --> 002117696 that's another 15 feet that's 30 foot of your movement 002121737 --> 002124460 okay that finishes beau's go avantika's up next 002132019 --> 002138380 she cannot see but what she can do is control water 002144937 --> 002147213 seeing this flames happen she (groans) pulls back closes her eyes for a second and 002153109 --> 002200033 raises her scarred hand where the sphere that she unlocked uk'otoa with raised up at that point 002200033 --> 002203526 the water from the ocean begins to rise-- 002203526 --> 002205477 all right it's a 4th-level spell so i need you to roll 002211094 --> 002214588 she does 002220121 --> 002224931 (cheering and laughter) 002224931 --> 002228565 holy shit you watch as the ocean begins to swell upwards avantika raises her arm-- but you 002246988 --> 002251337 said the walls are opaque can you see through the walls 002251337 --> 002254190 make a perception check 002255615 --> 002257220 (groaning) 002257220 --> 002258982 yeah it doesn't require you to have seen the person you know the spell's happening you 002319825 --> 002326083 know the direction of the person you rolled a high enough perception i'll allow it as you hear 002326083 --> 002330745 her chanting beneath her breath and you hear the wave rising you glance over in the direction and 002330745 --> 002337935 you having an instinctual affinity with flames and fire can barely see the darkened shape of her 002337935 --> 002343006 on the opposite side of the flames being warped by the light using that moment you put your hand 002343006 --> 002348374 forward and release the destructive pattern of your counterspell with that the swelling ocean 002348374 --> 002350766 splatters back down to the surface 002350766 --> 002356241 as that happens you hear her go <i>merde</i> and she begins to back up over to here onto the 002405209 --> 002411938 side and starts shouting vera that's going to end her turn because that was her action 002411938 --> 002413505 jester 002414326 --> 002425776 from where you are right now it's probably somewhere between 1200 and 1500 feet maybe 002435825 --> 002441107 beau and jester vanish from sight in a puff of purplish-pink smoke they both are gone that's 002518283 --> 002519359 your action 002519359 --> 002520104 you suddenly find yourself appearing in the center of the cobblestone street with the bloated 002526301 --> 002530612 cup maybe about two or three blocks up that way on the familiar path you know that you took hooking 002530612 --> 002534298 around the side that led you to the throne roost 002534298 --> 002535378 you also do notice now that there are some folks and some of the revelry watch that are now 002545765 --> 002551361 glancing over at the very bright inferno that is this beacon of flame over there in the shipyard 002551361 --> 002555345 you appear out of nowhere and there's two of them that look over in your direction noticing you 002555345 --> 002600622 appear that's all that's all that happens you still have your movement and your bonus 002600622 --> 002609251 okay good to know that finishes jester's go yasha's up 002614882 --> 002622856 you're down two party members in the middle of a u of flames 002629105 --> 002636150 that's two hours of online research about control water and wall of fire and interactions 002639476 --> 002642461 completely mute that is awesome 002642461 --> 002647732 liam and what are you doing yasha 002651461 --> 002703053 if she doesn't make an attack and isn't attacked she loses her rage 002707145 --> 002712223 okay she scoots by the one guy who's currently-- so that'd be (counting) 35 right there 002722854 --> 002724336 so she can get there as she swings by the one guy that's currently in the wall of fire is 002729226 --> 002732336 like shit he glances out of the corner of his eye and sees her go by and he gets one attack of 002732336 --> 002742738 opportunity swinging at her as she streaks through the space that's going to be a 15 to hit 002742738 --> 002744498 okay in an errant backhand swing-- she's got meaty hit points though that's going to be 002752736 --> 002756799 eight points of slashing damage to yasha as she rushes past 002756799 --> 002802783 okay 002803605 --> 002805831 she's not going to do anything with her action she can dash with her action and move 002808534 --> 002809633 again if you're trying to get her to move 002809633 --> 002816870 40 what's her movement 002818085 --> 002820375 all right as she charges past that guard sees her running and goes wait there's a huge 002828876 --> 002832508 distraction now this person here who saw all of a sudden the flames erupt who was part of avantika's 002832508 --> 002836554 crew one of the crew members is going to take an attack of opportunity at her as well as she runs 002836554 --> 002840974 past she is raging though so she takes half damage ooh that's going to be a 21 to hit 002840974 --> 002842374 she takes another eight damage but it's reduced to four that finishes yasha's go 002847283 --> 002848893 caduceus you're up 002848893 --> 002853882 you see yasha run past you you look over and you watch as beau and jester (blink) they're gone 002901153 --> 002910934 we'll find out movement 30 if you're rushing past her 002917224 --> 002920601 there are three ways off the boat there's either this gangplank which is closer to you 002925074 --> 002929014 this gangplank which is further from you but generally will meet the same distance or jumping 002929014 --> 002930263 in the water 002930263 --> 002933823 (counting) 30 gets you halfway on the plank there 002942902 --> 002949961 (counting) 30 you're right behind yasha that character does not get an attack of 002955381 --> 003002468 opportunity on you because they already used their reaction to hit yasha 003002468 --> 003009788 okay that finishes your turn now it's fjord aside from avantika the rest of them 003014570 --> 003017573 rolled piss-poor initiative which is to your advantage 003017573 --> 003025640 you are currently yes as far as wall of fire goes i'm checking the damage on that is 003029201 --> 003031650 that at the top of their turn 003031650 --> 003033139 oh at the end of each turn 003034732 --> 003037571 first time they enter it got you okay good to know so if they don't leave that area-- 003042208 --> 003045501 got you all right cool thank you 003047967 --> 003053740 you are going to begin casting thunder step 003102212 --> 003104152 you're readying it as a spell 003105191 --> 003107311 to trigger the instant nott moves you've got it okay 003111833 --> 003114052 got you he said moves all right that finishes your go now it's bouldergut's turn 003123972 --> 003131800 bouldergut angry about the flames goes (angry groan) looking aback batting at them a little 003131800 --> 003139330 bit with her arm goes and steps through the wall she takes the damage again roll another 5d8 that 003139330 --> 003144972 is going to step into the space where the flames are no longer touching her and on the outside it's 003144972 --> 003147574 not burning 003147574 --> 003154273 yeah they don't get a saving throw by walking through it she takes your damage what's 003157821 --> 003158632 the damage 003158632 --> 003159833 bouldergut comes through singed you see it as bits of her hair are curled up and red at the 003205820 --> 003211799 tips from where elements of it have turned to ember and takes a giant swing with her two-handed 003211799 --> 003214121 great club at you 003214121 --> 003216998 yeah that is that's a 23 to hit 003221154 --> 003222472 all right so with that that's 15 points of bludgeoning damage make a constitution save 003232873 --> 003234609 it's half or ten whichever is higher so constitution saving throw 003239630 --> 003240890 only ability checks are at disadvantage not saving throws 003242511 --> 003244248 just roll one more time 003246081 --> 003248569 fantastic she swings with her second attack that is 19 to hit 003301739 --> 003303088 that-- ooh 17 points of damage another dc10 make another constitution saving throw 003313068 --> 003320736 the flames flicker out as your concentration is abruptly broken by the ogre that stepped 003330240 --> 003342046 through the fire wall and twice bashed-- ford and caleb right there 003342046 --> 003344525 that ends bouldergut's turn now that comes to nott and vera going at the same time in the 003358827 --> 003403391 same initiative count you have a higher dexterity than vera so i'm letting you go first 003403391 --> 003411410 five ten 15 you're triggering your 003416160 --> 003417037 thunder step 15 are you going down the gangplank 003419810 --> 003427491 so what do you do now you do 003429297 --> 003431718 in what radius 003433539 --> 003434726 within ten feet that will get bouldergut it won't get anybody else after slamming her club 003442686 --> 003446676 twice into caleb you're holding his shoulder as the impact is causing him to nearly crumple 003446676 --> 003451898 against you you lift him up under the arm right as the spell finishes and (thunder crack) 003451898 --> 003459260 you are over here all right 003511098 --> 003512519 with a loud heavy burst of thunder impacts-- 003515880 --> 003517137 crackling through the air surrounding the shipyard with that both caleb and fjord vanish 003522537 --> 003528577 and reappear across the distance landing on the creaking wood of the old rickety dock hearing the 003528577 --> 003533737 footsteps behind you of caduceus and yasha trying to catch up the guard all looking confused at 003533737 --> 003539537 what's transpiring and a little ways down the way you can see there's about five or six other guards 003539537 --> 003543481 that are walking alongside the rest of the crew of the mistake that are all stopping and seeing 003543481 --> 003548489 what's going on here that's the end of your go you still have 15 feet of movement 003548489 --> 003556308 okay 003602447 --> 003603351 roll for an attack 003605261 --> 003606647 it's not 003607846 --> 003611448 14 you needed a 15 yeah that mage armor manages to deflect it 003616416 --> 003620780 all right you're right before yasha with that vera is going to take her turn vera steps 003636697 --> 003646218 up the side (counting) 30 and is now up on the top of the ship glancing over as everyone charges 003646218 --> 003655187 past she raises her arm come great serpent of the sea and she raises her hand above and brings 003655187 --> 003659570 her fingers together into a fist as she brings it down slowly like there's force against her fist 003659570 --> 003706298 you watch as this white cloud begins to appear and hailstone-like shards of ice begin to pelt down 003706298 --> 003713658 onto the dock below into this radius right here it does manage to get the guard as well 003713658 --> 003716558 what that does is it also turns this area into rough terrain until the end of her next turn 003729062 --> 003732786 he is there you guys are all here 003732786 --> 003735165 the cloud has vanished now 003736370 --> 003737696 however i need you all to make here we go it's an ice storm spell dexterity saving 003750267 --> 003755369 throw from the three of you please if you don't mind 003755369 --> 003757025 success for you 003757855 --> 003759105 success for you and roll for yasha as well if you don't mind 003801854 --> 003803716 yasha fails yasha takes 22 points of cold damage that's 11 points to caduceus and nott 003823483 --> 003827506 although none to you because you succeeded and you have evasion so you take none 003827506 --> 003829856 that's what rogues can do yeah whenever you have to make a dex save against an effect 003834470 --> 003839357 take half damage if you succeed you take no damage if you fail you take half you should 003839357 --> 003840766 read your character sheet 003840766 --> 003844109 yes you may 003844937 --> 003847058 so you get to re-roll that once 003848925 --> 003850550 okay so she only takes 11 however everything in this for the next round is 003854517 --> 003858404 difficult terrain as there's now giant hailstones and sleet slicked all over the rickety docks 003858404 --> 003859266 yes 003859849 --> 003901525 that's going to end vera's go now it comes to caleb 003907365 --> 003910225 hanging over here on the side 003911227 --> 003915828 there are two chests off to the side there 003917725 --> 003927783 okay go for the roll on that 003932624 --> 003935287 he's throwing one of the chests over here 003936838 --> 003938310 you dart forward across-- the guards that are there watching this happen with the rest of 004005103 --> 004010944 the crew of the mistake you zip past them in this blur flash-like entity they all get pushed back 004010944 --> 004017432 from the impact as you push through all right that finishes your turn now it's the 004017432 --> 004021586 guards the guards-- 004021627 --> 004023301 that guard did take damage 004024228 --> 004025066 he's looking real rough he's going to back up out of the middle of the sleet and make his way 004035606 --> 004039995 this way he looks dazed and is trying to figure out what's going on and where to ally himself 004039995 --> 004047165 with you guys go running off the side as the flames are down they're going to give chase this 004047165 --> 004050712 guard's going to rush up here and this guy's going to rush up here they're not attacking but 004050712 --> 004055761 they're coming out towards you and saying stop stop halt they're shouting towards you guys to 004055761 --> 004105482 stop the rest of the guards are going to push forward and start making their way up this 004105482 --> 004111444 direction and they're starting to-- they're now catching up four of them are going up towards 004111444 --> 004116425 fjord and one of them is going back towards caleb they're starting to gather and they're putting up 004116425 --> 004122297 their hands like do not flee they're not talking yet but you see their physicality is like we 004122297 --> 004124646 don't know what's happening but don't you go anywhere 004124646 --> 004127804 that ends their go it's now ipess' turn as a bonus action he's going to hide and move 004143495 --> 004148507 underneath and around the rocks to this side and he's going to pull around from the corner with his 004148507 --> 004155079 hand crossbow and take a shot at caduceus from behind caduceus what's your passive perception 004155109 --> 004157867 18 okay you do notice him out of the corner of your eye just barely so he is not 004203009 --> 004207540 hidden from you this means he does not get sneak attack damage or advantage on the attack that is 004207540 --> 004209277 still a natural 20 on this hit 004209277 --> 004213540 which one 004214533 --> 004221388 what does it say what's the wording 004224997 --> 004227108 when you or a creature 004228066 --> 004228478 then yeah 004229456 --> 004231158 you channel divinity to prevent the critical it is now a regular hit fantastic you 004236508 --> 004245446 take three points of piercing damage it sticks into your shield and grinds inside and actually 004245446 --> 004249469 hits a little bit of the forearm but you manage to deflect most of the impact and bolt gets caught 004249469 --> 004251926 in the center of there mostly no damage to you 004251926 --> 004256660 one of the guards turns and looks towards ipess-- actually both of these guards turn and 004301381 --> 004306307 glance over and having this moment of not entirely certain which side to go with 004306307 --> 004310560 that ends there it's now the rest of the crew's turn he's going to come to the side there 004318421 --> 004329001 this one's going to move over to this side there this guy's going to run across this one's going 004329001 --> 004339641 to move over here and this half orc's going to go and hide in there 004339641 --> 004340883 with that we've got some heavy crossbow action from this guy and this guy caleb is out of 004355922 --> 004407301 range of both of them unfortunately both of these guys right here i'm going to roll four attacks 004407301 --> 004412779 one of them is going to be heavy crossbow to fjord because fjord is still within-- oh no it's 004412779 --> 004415320 a 400-foot range for the next one 004415320 --> 004416779 yeah heavy crossbow with 100 feet you're going to be within the disadvantage range 004421541 --> 004424451 increment but those things are going to fire at you caleb since you're the one that's the 004424451 --> 004425310 furthest away 004425310 --> 004427240 no 004427772 --> 004428841 he does have disadvantage on the attack though that is a 16 and a 13 naturally 004434591 --> 004435385 plus four it's going to be 17 004437107 --> 004438746 that is nine points of piercing damage to you 004448107 --> 004449636 are you serious 004450565 --> 004452635 caleb (thud) as he darts past this bolt streaks past (impact noise) in the back and with 004458856 --> 004502990 the momentum of his running he crumples into the ground and tumbles and skids to a halt in the 004502990 --> 004507345 middle-- you're watching this fjord as this happens the other one up here at the top of the 004507345 --> 004515707 crow's nest is going to take a shot at nott actually you are within the 100-foot range 004515707 --> 004519645 that's still a natural two so it misses you it splinters the wood right next to your foot as you 004519645 --> 004523708 step out of the way shards of wood go flying from the impact and the heavy bolt about that long is 004523708 --> 004532504 jammed at an angle into the planks before you this one here and this one are both going to take 004532504 --> 004539834 heavy crossbow shots one's at caduceus and one's at yasha so the most visible against caduceus-- 004539834 --> 004544786 oh man they're rolling terrible now that's a six 004544786 --> 004546854 yeah yasha however does get hit with a 17 i believe right 004552246 --> 004553356 yasha takes eight points of piercing damage 17 to hit eight points reduced to four 004557246 --> 004601376 this guy here has a hand crossbow you are then in disadvantage range he's going to take 004607894 --> 004612259 another shot at caduceus with disadvantage no that's another six 004612259 --> 004618625 okay that's the end of the crewmen there that's the end of the combat round these people 004625146 --> 004629566 seeing all the fighting are going to duck into their ship and hide this team on this end they 004629566 --> 004634007 all move out of the way but they're keeping an eye over the side of what's happening top of 004634007 --> 004645597 the combat round beau and jester you appear beau in the middle of this chaos flames behind 004645597 --> 004651028 you you hear a thunderous blast that echoes from behind you glance over you look forward 004651028 --> 004655586 jester's already running in the direction you're on the rough and tumble rock and elements of 004655586 --> 004700464 cobblestone that have long worn off and not been replaced in front of you a little ways up ahead 004700464 --> 004705335 you can see the tavern 004705335 --> 004706528 the bloated cup 004707904 --> 004712974 okay so you full run 004715449 --> 004721670 in doing so you make it all the way up the street's there and there's buildings on each 004739199 --> 004745568 side to the front right of you--this perspective for you on this side is where you see the tavern 004745568 --> 004750760 there are folks out there morning drinking like whoa watch you whiz past you make your way up 004750760 --> 004754834 the street a little further and there are a few town guards that are looking over towards the inn 004754834 --> 004757830 the sound and all the craziness happening and they notice you approaching and they all 004757830 --> 004803209 instinctively begin to go into a phalanx they all go shoulder-to-shoulder and they're now blocking 004803209 --> 004809017 off the road from your continual passage no weapons drawn but in the midst of all this they 004809017 --> 004815259 see crazy stuff happening and the one person darting at an inhuman speed away from it and 004815259 --> 004821759 their instinct is to go whoa whoa whoa let's figure this out they're not aggressive yet 004821759 --> 004822262 that's your turn 004822262 --> 004824588 i'd say this happens at the very end of your turn you're running running running all of a 004826699 --> 004830604 sudden you stop right as they (clanking) right there in front of you we'll pick that up next turn 004830604 --> 004832061 that brings us to avantika's go all right oh man okay avantika is going to leap down off 004848797 --> 004851110 the side of the ship acrobatics check 004851110 --> 004853659 no it's just difficult terrain 004857358 --> 004859096 i will say it would increase the dc for her landing i'll give you that but she did roll an 004902349 --> 004903555 18 on her acrobatics check 004903555 --> 004905135 leaping down lands right in front of nott skids down lands a few inches back before coming 004912647 --> 004917125 to a stop the ice grinds at the back of her foot and creates this little pile where the momentum 004917125 --> 004922218 eventually stops holding her rapier in one hand and the dagger in the other looking down at you 004922218 --> 004929119 nott goes ah you should not have crossed me she's going to take three strikes at you two with 004929206 --> 004935730 her rapier and one with her dagger the dagger you can see now is-- you've seen it a little bit 004935730 --> 004941409 in the battles you were in dark spaces so it was hard to make a real distinguishing visual of it 004941409 --> 004946278 but out here in the open air as she's clutching the dagger aggressively there's a faint black 004946278 --> 004952808 energy faintly drifting off the edge of the blade the attack with the rapier first one-- natural 004952808 --> 005000060 four no it's going to miss you natural three both rapier shots nothing the dagger however 005000060 --> 005001801 that's going to be a 17 to hit 005001801 --> 005003052 okay she's rolling real bad as the two rapier shots you dodge out of the way but she 005011559 --> 005017749 uses that to feint forward and jam the blade up into the front of your stomach and rib cage area 005017749 --> 005025221 that is going to be nine points of piercing damage and an additional eight points of necrotic damage 005025221 --> 005027641 okay 005029250 --> 005031701 yeah it would halve both from the attack so take eight points of damage you manage to push 005037330 --> 005042208 away with your momentum the blade doesn't sink quite as deep and you grabbing the wrist 005042208 --> 005046819 preventing it from really coming to the hilt in your chest you pull away that's going to end her 005046819 --> 005054979 turn she shouts over her shoulder and goes vera we need friends jester your turn 005054979 --> 005056632 you saw beauregard dart up past you 005059472 --> 005103518 if you look a little bit ahead of you around each of the buildings that are right in 005108360 --> 005112912 front of you there are alleys that curve around that would eventually meet in the road that you 005112912 --> 005114019 guys are currently running down 005114019 --> 005116943 yes but you'd have to move up you probably wouldn't be able to get to an alley to do it this 005125102 --> 005130441 turn there are people around there are folks that are watching all this chaos happen off in the distance 005130441 --> 005136860 okay make a deception check 005144050 --> 005149121 you're a little ways up i'll roll a perception check for them how about that 005156794 --> 005158349 that's a cocked roll the guards unfortunately do not hear it they're not as 005204821 --> 005208809 perceptive and their focus is distracted between this and they hear shouting but they're not 005208809 --> 005213698 picking up the words however some of the folks nearby glance over at you and go oh shit 005213698 --> 005216969 really finishes his drink real fast 005216969 --> 005218108 i've got to go see this they seem less worried about their lives and more like oh i 005223607 --> 005225816 want to go see how this goes down 005225816 --> 005227847 they're not around in front of you there's one coming out of a building and you see a couple 005239410 --> 005245841 folks that are on the front porch entrance area of the tavern 005245841 --> 005249738 it's up to you what are you doing 005252239 --> 005259558 okay jester you turn around and start heading back towards the group it's a long run 005305646 --> 005307198 because you went 500 feet from the ship 005307198 --> 005310658 you go for it that finishes your go yasha's up 005317958 --> 005325359 she's going to use her reaction to parry which adds a plus two to her armor class 005340216 --> 005341744 that misses 005342963 --> 005348871 25 hits 005350822 --> 005354841 14 points of damage to avantika as the blade carves through she tries to parry it with 005405017 --> 005410238 the rapier but it slips down and carves a slight bit off of her forearm before it gleans off and 005410238 --> 005413220 you can see a little bit of red immediately exposed where the cloth was carved through and a 005413220 --> 005417129 little bit of the skin and flesh removed with it 005417129 --> 005422017 okay that's going to be (counting) 40 that's as far as she can get 005429820 --> 005431768 difficult terrain yep 005433170 --> 005434614 as an action you can angel of death 005440313 --> 005443048 they're more for the surprise party factor than the actual flight thing 005448079 --> 005449210 okay that finishes yasha's go caduceus you're up 005452662 --> 005506359 there's the guards there there's avantika avantika does not have a reaction she already 005511200 --> 005512850 used it to parry 005512850 --> 005521979 correct 005523839 --> 005525350 i'll say for the purposes of keeping tabs on you this will be your marker 005551756 --> 005553923 no it's your ability as soon as you cast something you lose your invisibility 005611188 --> 005614230 actually let me check the wording on that if it's different from the actual spell because 005617392 --> 005618483 usually it's-- 005618483 --> 005620269 can magically turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack make 005629462 --> 005632620 a damage roll or force someone to make a saving throw you can cast a spell as long as it doesn't 005632620 --> 005636020 damage or attack somebody 005636020 --> 005638342 or force someone to make a saving throw 005639864 --> 005647108 it would be 30 feet with this 005651821 --> 005652619 (counting) 005700101 --> 005704022 you can go at an angle in front of yasha 005706281 --> 005709750 that ends your go caduceus fjord you're up your friends are catching up behind you 005714391 --> 005717537 there's a sleet storm slamming there's guards swarming around your direction telling you to 005717537 --> 005723148 halt and up ahead of you you watched a speedy caleb grind into the ground what are you doing 005723148 --> 005725914 i wasn't sure if you had taken this spell i prepared for it just in case 005757971 --> 005800809 this is it 005802871 --> 005806055 you'd be just on the edge of the ship there 005813010 --> 005816883 with the dark speech that emanates from inside of fjord's body it echoes out like a 005833496 --> 005839567 weird discordant harmony of several voices you've never heard for those that are present you guys 005839567 --> 005840935 are way the fuck away 005840935 --> 005843427 there's the sound of reality cracking and you look up and watch where in the center of the 005847747 --> 005854698 sky there at the very edge of the squalleater's deck two large meaty hands pull open this 005854698 --> 005901655 barrier between the realms and stepping out you see this large gorilla-like demon covered in fur 005901655 --> 005906568 and horns at the edge these giant fists with tusks that emerge from beneath this chin and these 005906568 --> 005912697 red burning coal-like eyes as it steps out it turns right towards vera whose eyes are wide and 005912697 --> 005919895 (roars) in her face you watch her hair get blown back a bit spittle across her chin that's your action 005919895 --> 005925763 all right you manage to misty step 005932012 --> 005936854 okay this puts you-- 005938498 --> 005940149 correct you went 30 feet forward and you still have your movement 005946554 --> 005951750 okay so you go heading towards caleb after shouting avantika's not to be trusted after 010000214 --> 010011793 summoning a fucking demon i'm going to ask you to make a persuasion check with disadvantage because 010011793 --> 010014412 you just summoned a <i>fucking</i> demon 010014412 --> 010015960 all right well they seem to be more focused on what just appeared through the scar in 010027167 --> 010032073 reality you left all right so you charge past you're coming upon the group of guards now that 010032073 --> 010035322 are around the rest of the crew of the mistake but they've forgotten about that crew at that 010035322 --> 010040688 point they saw caleb rush past two of them went over to figure out what the hell happened as he 010040688 --> 010045700 basically darted-- football fumbled off to the side the others are turning and coming towards 010045700 --> 010047868 your direction but it's not their turn yet 010047868 --> 010048519 all right that finishes your go fjord it is now bouldergut's go 010050832 --> 010053136 you do yes 010054361 --> 010103111 19 right after avantika 010107452 --> 010111999 oh man 010114720 --> 010118647 correct when you summon it on each of its turns thereafter you issue a verbal command to 010133269 --> 010137312 it so you can keep issuing commands every turn however it doesn't go until its next initiative 010137312 --> 010142156 all right that's <i>real</i> interesting 010142156 --> 010143029 so bouldergut's going to move (counting) i'm going to make a saving throw for the now 010156194 --> 010158201 partially-damaged-- okay yeah that's fine 010158201 --> 010159256 the plank is going to snap gets her about there and is going do the dash up here the next 010209934 --> 010216389 two guards who were now focused on bouldergut coming forward and they're not entirely certain 010216389 --> 010222035 what's happening they're focused on the demon there's weirdness from all sides it seems the 010222035 --> 010227891 watch are not used to this chaos breaking this far in towards darktow usually the reef and the 010227891 --> 010233558 defenses they built around the reef are enough to keep things like this far from the island that 010233558 --> 010237412 finishes bouldergut's turn that brings us to nott and vera but nott you get to go first 010237412 --> 010244437 (counting) you're next to yasha with your movement 010248963 --> 010251651 (counting) 25 30 010253804 --> 010256737 you are and you still have your bonus action 010259816 --> 010307726 okay 010326118 --> 010330261 what's the save 010331795 --> 010336013 natural five 010339315 --> 010341027 she's very good at a few things but she doesn't have the highest intelligence to get to 010344835 --> 010346087 that point 010346087 --> 010346741 she's smart but not that smart 010348341 --> 010349662 i went to public school 010351752 --> 010352776 it's a giant-- it looks like it once was a mast of a ship that's been whittled down into a greatclub 010408988 --> 010417952 okay all right avantika glances over and (sigh) for a moment you see a look of relief 010431141 --> 010433151 come over avantika's face 010433151 --> 010434074 all right is that your turn 010435127 --> 010436410 you got it now it's vera's turn vera seeing this happen-- oh man 010446063 --> 010449798 all right vera's going to glance off to the side-- actually she's going to try to move out of 010501779 --> 010504757 melee of this barlgura 010504757 --> 010506407 yeah 010507118 --> 010507731 so make a strike 010508891 --> 010517114 nine misses 010517871 --> 010519338 as the giant demon swings outward it impacts and deflects off the energy field of mage 010524844 --> 010529672 armor that pushes it off to the side vera steps back the reach on that is five foot right for 010529672 --> 010532185 the attack just making sure 010532185 --> 010533318 okay she pulls out of it and goes (harsh sigh) looks down at avantika looks down at all 010538090 --> 010540390 the guards that are gathering as they're moving in 010540390 --> 010547566 (music plays) 010547566 --> 010550264 yeah that does it all right she goes after hearing what avantika said goes everyone 010603807 --> 010611121 they have crossed darktow take them to the plank king you watch as she's saying these words her 010611121 --> 010615373 hand sends this strange series of symbols through and casts mass suggestion on the guards in the 010615373 --> 010616783 vicinity of 60 feet of her 010616783 --> 010618656 yes 010620118 --> 010621597 fail fail fail it's working out great it's like two seven four three ten fail 010634815 --> 010636749 natural one 010636749 --> 010638800 all of them failed you watch as all of these guards have the confusion suddenly 010643369 --> 010651415 crystalizes and all of them look towards your group and start shouting stop them they're thieves 010651415 --> 010656118 vera after casting that is going to use the rest of her movement (counting) oh god 010712382 --> 010714957 i'll put her there it's fine all right that ends vera's turn caleb for your turn make 010721235 --> 010725507 a death save it's the beginning of your round i keep forgetting it's the beginning of your turn 010725507 --> 010727496 in case you roll a natural 20 010727496 --> 010730841 cool that's one success 010732232 --> 010732848 all right 010733889 --> 010735393 at the end of vera's turn this goes away 010738496 --> 010741397 marisha and the sleet and stuff has now melted and dripped off the sides these guards here-- 010751964 --> 010755402 (counting) 30 on each side and they're both going to attempt to grapple yasha go ahead and 010806306 --> 010810234 make an athletics check for her she has advantage because she is raging 010810234 --> 010815138 yeah one guy fails to grapple then the other guy's going to attempt to-- make another 010818843 --> 010822239 check she has to beat a 16 010822239 --> 010824377 yeah they just can't-- they try and grab her and she shrugs them off no problem these 010830291 --> 010843773 other guards here begin to swarm up to try and grab nott this one's going to move up and try and 010843773 --> 010850176 grab yasha this one here is going to-- he tries to move forward towards yasha and ends up 010850176 --> 010856522 chest-bumping space in the middle of the air and confusedly is going to try and grapple whatever's 010856522 --> 010902888 there he has disadvantage on that so first i'm going to do that with you rolled really well with 010902888 --> 010906924 disadvantage natural 19 and a natural 17 make an acrobatics or athletics check to see if he doesn't 010906924 --> 010908381 grapple you 010908381 --> 010911355 okay 010922440 --> 010923897 (laughter) 010923897 --> 010925672 no no no he tries to grab you and he gets ahold of you and you push him off and he 010932757 --> 010938284 looks really confused he grabbed <i>something</i> before he really knew what was happening and is 010938284 --> 010941081 really confused for a moment he thinks it was a ghost 010941081 --> 010943364 for the one that rushed up to try to grab yasha again because the other guys failed ooh 010946882 --> 010950698 natural 18 so roll for her it's going to be a 20 010950698 --> 010953296 she is currently grappled by this guy he's now grabbed and is holding her in place she's 010958686 --> 011003119 (grunting) the two other guys are going to try to dogpile in to try to stop her from moving we have 011003119 --> 011004639 three attempting to grapple you nott 011004639 --> 011005485 yes 011006084 --> 011008474 all right so first guy-- 011013185 --> 011015052 you roll an acrobatics check against them 011017387 --> 011018997 that's a success next guy natural 20 011022024 --> 011023430 that's 22 011024358 --> 011025148 oh my god all right all right so he manages to actually grab-- the first one you're 011034300 --> 011038870 just too slippery oh god you turn on the side the other guy grabs you right as he 011038870 --> 011044367 squeezes you just jump out of it land on his arms and then step off the third one's going to 011044367 --> 011048790 try and grab you that's a six go and roll 011048790 --> 011050543 okay you still manage to slip away none of them can grab you you're too fast tiny goblin 011053676 --> 011101265 form quick nab her you're jumping around darting around squeezing out of the way no 011101265 --> 011113224 impact all right that finishes the guards' turn ipess is going to (counting) try to hide at the 011113224 --> 011121755 top of it ooh natural 20 so he's going to scoot up around the side dart off the edge he's 011121755 --> 011130230 going to make a shot at the barlgura who has shown up with advantage that is going to be a 19 011130230 --> 011131424 to hit what's its armor class 011131424 --> 011132071 okay he does get sneak attack damage against it 011134254 --> 011136102 that's an additional 2d6 so 011138640 --> 011140865 14 points of piercing damage does it have any resistances 011146869 --> 011154964 damage immunity to poison that's all 011156422 --> 011157505 got it no immunities to non-magical weapons 011200881 --> 011204729 okay just making sure all right yeah so it takes full damage on that mark that 011207870 --> 011209079 yeah that's going to end ipess's turn now it's the crew's turn this one's going to make a 011218766 --> 011223705 step back trying to get out of range of the barlgura it already used its reaction to do an 011223705 --> 011229324 attack it's going to reload and fire with its crossbow against it ooh that's going to be a 17 011229324 --> 011230959 to hit 011230959 --> 011231739 all right it suffers eight points of piercing damage 011234609 --> 011235436 these guys here are going to fire down after reloading they're now focusing on the giant 011242066 --> 011244405 demon they're not focusing on you guys so 011244405 --> 011245204 they're turning like oh jesus 011246680 --> 011249442 he's going to move over here and attempt to fire at it from there this one's going to stand 011253120 --> 011257511 where he is and reload these guys are going to spin around and focus on this terrible creature 011257511 --> 011310461 all right this guy here is going to stay behind that's (counting) six shots against the barlgura 011310461 --> 011312345 so all right 18 to hit 011316995 --> 011317833 one point of damage 011319971 --> 011320826 nine to hit 011323348 --> 011325408 all right seven to hit 011328375 --> 011330633 18 to hit 011331835 --> 011332538 nine points of damage 011333559 --> 011334432 16 to hit 011336383 --> 011337282 seven points of damage 011339103 --> 011339985 the last one is 14 to hit 011342713 --> 011346536 that finishes the crew's go as they're all laying into this demon that appeared on there you 011350712 --> 011355117 watch as (growl) as it turns back to yell all of a sudden it gets another bolt in the chest and in 011355117 --> 011358835 the side it's getting all of these bolts that are now sticking out of its body as it's raging 011358835 --> 011405301 angrily on the deck of the ship you can see now there's a giant burned u on the side it wasn't 011405301 --> 011410670 around long enough to catch the ship on fire but there is a dark scarring on the base of the deck 011410670 --> 011415603 there all right one more round and it would've caught fire 011415603 --> 011421805 (laughter) that would've been great 011424536 --> 011425783 oh man all right that ends top of the round all right so beau the guards are there 011433150 --> 011437198 in front of you right now there's three of them shoulder to shoulder and there's one of them that 011437198 --> 011444198 looks-- the one in the center is a little better-armored they go hey miss miss where 011444198 --> 011447552 are you going they're looking at you and both looking at what's over there 011447552 --> 011453052 make a persuasion check 011502086 --> 011504563 no because it's honest 011508715 --> 011512484 there was nothing about that statement that was incorrect 011515120 --> 011518867 you're not sure if he believes you but he's not aggressive if that makes sense he goes 011525375 --> 011531955 well be that as it may we need to figure out what's happening before we can have you running so 011531955 --> 011533777 quickly with intent 011533777 --> 011538358 we'll send for him stay here and the two other guards stay there and hold the position and 011546198 --> 011549853 fill in the space he turns around and starts making his way towards the throne roost 011549853 --> 011551285 he goes ah i've got it and he continues walking 011553483 --> 011555704 we'll say that you've used an action at this point you still have your bonus and your 011600290 --> 011602542 movement if you want to use it 011602542 --> 011605290 it's up to you you can go along with it and stay there and wait for your friends or anything 011612645 --> 011617156 else you want to try they are not aggressive at this point they're just holding the line 011617156 --> 011618731 the tension in your body is rising up and for a second the muscles bulge and the veins 011639198 --> 011643329 begin to pop from the sheer amount of adrenaline that's in your system and your urge to charge 011643329 --> 011649934 through you just breathe heavily as your entire form sinks into it the two guards you can see 011649934 --> 011655711 their tension as their hands were going for a weapon drop they both go into a watching but 011655711 --> 011659880 waiting pose that ends your go 011700106 --> 011701882 it's now avantika's turn avantika sees the guards shifting their allegiance under the effect 011709200 --> 011715517 of this mass suggestion spell she's going to turn and attempt to go after yasha 011715517 --> 011718157 what 011719574 --> 011721767 yeah 011722570 --> 011725026 good she's making three strikes against her because she's the one closest to it yeah 011739476 --> 011746704 she's not too hurt she's not doing anything defensively or you know what 011746704 --> 011751071 no yasha's being held as far as she knows yasha is doing okay or the guards have her nott 011756335 --> 011800811 is the one that keeps darting around so she's going to raise a hand and cast eldritch blast at nott 011800811 --> 011804079 ooh that's 24 to hit 011810645 --> 011812738 you take three points of force damage as you're jumping off suddenly you get hit across 011821688 --> 011826407 the chin but it's a glancing blow and your world goes a little dizzy for a second the second one 011826407 --> 011828439 misses entirely 011828439 --> 011830957 yes 011831690 --> 011835363 she didn't roll very good on the damage 011837757 --> 011842066 technically a grapple is an attack yeah she's going to use her movement to back up five 011848426 --> 011852034 six going towards this backing up towards the ship 011852034 --> 011853868 correct instead of doing that she stayed back to do that and is now looking up towards the 011857257 --> 011902905 demon that is raging onto the base of the ship seeing the guards have got this under the 011902905 --> 011906702 suggestion spell she seems to be backing off slightly that's going to finish avantika's go 011906702 --> 011908175 now it's the barlgura's turn 011908175 --> 011916190 oh-ho-ho 011918435 --> 011919683 because it can do that 011929813 --> 011930478 go for it 011931716 --> 011939829 yeah that hits roll damage on that one 011942127 --> 011945384 okay good to know she does succeed on her constitution save with a natural 16 she does 011958457 --> 012001192 every time she takes damage to see if she can maintain her mass suggestion 012001192 --> 012002065 that hits roll damage 012010336 --> 012016936 all right natural 12 succeeds on the save 012023288 --> 012024199 her con bonus isn't that high so it's just a straight roll on the d20 012029579 --> 012031229 16 does hit all three hit 012032905 --> 012036655 that's a natural ten just barely makes it does not drop concentration but took some hits 012048678 --> 012054739 vera's looking a little roughed up and scared as shit she runs down the stairs and turns around 012054739 --> 012100639 and sees this thing (roars) it starts roughing her up she's thrown against the back is pummeled 012100639 --> 012105258 into the side of the ship and is trying desperately to look for a way to escape 012105258 --> 012106289 that ends the barlgura's turn i need you to take a charisma saving throw for it 012108794 --> 012111463 correct 012124908 --> 012129325 correct and then it returns to its home plane 012132566 --> 012133906 well no you haven't lost concentration on it yet it stays for the hour but then once you 012151713 --> 012154817 lose concentration roll a d6 to see how many more rounds it stays 012154817 --> 012158561 nope 012159579 --> 012200983 no worries that ends the barlgura's turn jester you're up 012203157 --> 012204083 you've ducked to the side you've cast disguise self on yourself 012206622 --> 012209438 okay 012210278 --> 012213171 make a deception check 012232958 --> 012234423 okay people in the nearby streets that are seeing this go like are you serious that crazy bitch 012249712 --> 012252280 a few people nearby take this and go oh oh and start going inside to avoid this other 012300960 --> 012305870 folks are getting angry and throwing their glasses on the ground and oh i knew one day-- ugh 012305870 --> 012310588 they're pissed and going to grab their things and maybe start a militia against her we don't know 012310588 --> 012314093 you've rallied the corner 012314093 --> 012318628 there are guards rushing towards the action that's happening behind you and there are a few 012325900 --> 012329658 that are-- there's a bunch now making their way towards this intersection 012329658 --> 012333714 okay you're up ahead and you hear this in the back but you don't know it's jester you just 012337666 --> 012341321 hear a lot of shouting so you're like oh man my deception worked other people are yelling this 012341321 --> 012343958 perfect 012345281 --> 012347697 that finishes jester's turn it's yasha's go yasha is currently grappled but you can still 012351332 --> 012355502 make her actions she has to use an action to break free if she wants to to move but otherwise 012355502 --> 012358877 her movement is zero but she has advantage because she's still raging 012358877 --> 012401313 all right make an athletics check with advantage 012403921 --> 012408696 he got a six 012409707 --> 012410486 so the guy managed to luckily grapple her last turn she just flicks him off he's like 012414929 --> 012417088 ow so she's free of the grapple 012417088 --> 012425450 okay 012426421 --> 012431670 all right that ends yasha's turn caduceus 012438907 --> 012441329 yes you do 012442822 --> 012447829 they all (gasp) 012452286 --> 012457240 you can bless yourself 012508757 --> 012511214 all right that gives you d4 012512665 --> 012516896 there you go 012517980 --> 012521738 okay so that ends your turn or what else you doing 012531250 --> 012536569 there's no attack he looks startled and his hands are forward to try and-- they're not 012541758 --> 012545677 weapon drawn to bludgeon you but they're trying to keep you from going anywhere 012545677 --> 012548413 from where you are there 90 from there about 110 feet from you 012554625 --> 012602186 he's going to attempt to stop you 012604021 --> 012609157 no unfortunately you may not know this they are currently magically compelled 012615189 --> 012618507 you would not know that 012619529 --> 012622978 as you're trying to tell him this and trying to scoot by he like-- 012628359 --> 012634011 he heads you off of the pass and is saying stay put 012636376 --> 012638411 stay put 012639372 --> 012640518 he'll deal with it stay put 012641501 --> 012644576 the other way 012648323 --> 012652116 okay there's other guards here that are-- 012653926 --> 012656138 okay he's still trying to maneuver around 012658581 --> 012704608 fjord you're up next 012725886 --> 012729060 there you go all right fjord it's your go 012733256 --> 012735284 yeah with the misty step and the movement you had so you are 30 feet from him 012740313 --> 012743581 as you do you rush past some of the guards that are on the opposite side that were rushing 012747279 --> 012752720 towards you there's i believe at this point four of them that were heading your direction 012752720 --> 012755768 because there was the one that was going towards caleb so we'll say two of them you'll have to 012755768 --> 012759474 push past they both are going to make attacks of opportunity on you just an attempt to grapple to stop 012759474 --> 012801426 make your acrobatics or athletics check to try and break free 012805478 --> 012811368 that succeeds they literally rolled a natural 14 plus two 16 was the highest roll the 012815942 --> 012821734 other rolled a two you manage to shrug past you push out of his grasp he's like hey wait 012821734 --> 012823497 well no you-- 012824868 --> 012830138 all right so you come to consciousness on the ground 012839024 --> 012853301 well now it's bouldergut's turn bouldergut's going to move up shove past and 012859292 --> 012903398 begin to take a giant club towards the barlgura down towards it 012903398 --> 012905707 first hit is a 20 to hit 012910715 --> 012912094 other's an 18 012913244 --> 012914822 both hit okay first hit is 12 points of bludgeoning damage 012919741 --> 012921033 the other one is 16 points of bludgeoning damage 012924196 --> 012925533 avantika see what 012928947 --> 012933783 yeah it's really confusing 012935587 --> 012936733 she's like no what are you doing but she's used to bouldergut not being the brightest 012942435 --> 012946636 what's that 012947613 --> 012948424 oh reckless that's right yeah no a four and a two so both of those worked out fine 012953946 --> 012959942 that's the end of bouldergut's turn bouldergut's slamming onto this demon going go to sleep 012959942 --> 013007968 don't hurt my friends finishing her go it is now nott's turn 013007968 --> 013010099 yes and they're all-- hands on their weapons trying to subdue you and grab you 013014449 --> 013023129 they're now shouting stop halt i say guards they're all volunteer pirates of the revelry that 013023129 --> 013026043 help keep watch on the shipyard here 013026043 --> 013027324 no the ones from the ship are further this way and they were being brought by guards but 013036028 --> 013040545 they've been left alone to focus on you guys yasha currently is stopped and they're all very 013040545 --> 013045050 much in a stay there type position they're in the process of subduing their quarry 013045050 --> 013047378 gotcha 013048714 --> 013056943 you slip past and make your way up towards fjord and caleb with your disengage and your 013102306 --> 013105156 movement and your action you can make your way-- 013105156 --> 013106864 yeah 60 feet from there that would put you not quite to where they are but it gets you 013110442 --> 013113606 up to where the other guards were that he rushed past and just beyond them because disengaged 013113606 --> 013122488 they don't get any attacks of opportunity all right that ends your turn vera is looking not 013122488 --> 013126642 too great vera is going to-- 013133822 --> 013136016 is going to cast scorching ray against the barlgura she's going to attempt to take a step 013140665 --> 013143309 back up the stairs barlgura does get an attack of opportunity on her 013143309 --> 013145342 15 just hits <i>just</i> hits 013157387 --> 013159570 ten points of damage ugh all right makes it natural ten again doesn't break the spell 013211619 --> 013212938 she's having good luck with those rolls takes it climbs to the top spins around is 013216941 --> 013224392 going to scorching ray towards the barlgura that's 3d20s against it okay that's going to be 013224392 --> 013228976 20 20 and 17 013228976 --> 013230615 to hit 013231106 --> 013232420 no all right not a great damage roll the balgura takes 18 points of fire damage 013246069 --> 013248450 caleb you're up 013256192 --> 013257018 you wake up come to consciousness on the ground fjord is getting you up you look over 013302830 --> 013306678 your shoulder and you can see there's a whole shit ton of guards in the area that are subduing 013306678 --> 013311150 yasha caduceus seems to have put his hands up 013311150 --> 013314678 from the boat from now you'd be about 160 feet 013320371 --> 013324230 correct 013325387 --> 013330392 yeah 013331618 --> 013338761 in your state-- where do you want to put it 013350725 --> 013352878 you don't know where are you putting it 013354369 --> 013356627 at the mast all righty as you wake up you spin fire this ray streaks past all the guards 013406638 --> 013414061 who are calm at this point see this happen and watch the streak go by and detonate on the ship 013414061 --> 013418091 the bright flash of light echoes against everybody's faces as the impact hits go ahead and 013418091 --> 013419430 roll damage 013419430 --> 013422710 yeah totally man 013424362 --> 013425952 that'll go well 013435671 --> 013438397 31 good rolls 013447778 --> 013448891 okay so bouldergut that's a fail bouldergut's looking rough 013454702 --> 013458637 just a strawberry scrape all right this guy what's the dc on it 013506903 --> 013526677 it should be 16 i think it's eight plus your proficiency plus that 013531823 --> 013533033 all right so he succeeds he rolled a 17 so he takes-- 31 you said so 15 points of damage 013542429 --> 013548634 to him oh he's dead he's fucking done he took damage from the fire wall earlier 013548634 --> 013553071 yeah that guy he makes his save but he dies too 013600185 --> 013602271 this guy doesn't make his save he's dead 013607689 --> 013611269 roll for the barlgura 013615128 --> 013617517 yeah the barlgura is destroyed vera-- that's cocked 013627404 --> 013628647 that is 13 does not succeed vera takes 31 damage vera's almost dead is burned incinerated 013638914 --> 013640020 on the ground not moving 013640020 --> 013640677 concentration spell's lost 013643614 --> 013647456 it doesn't work like that unfortunately but their compulsion's no longer there 013651419 --> 013654482 yeah with that the spell fades vera crumbles to the ground barlgura's gone giant 013710247 --> 013717803 explosion the mast leans slightly to one side from the impact this guy was out of the radius actually 013717803 --> 013719537 i'd say if he hit the mast-- i'd say it hit him actually yeah 013722072 --> 013724302 ipess has to make it as well he fails so he gets incinerated 013728619 --> 013733670 ipess does make it i need you to make a wisdom saving throw caleb 013742726 --> 013744260 no the dc's real high on this one 013745974 --> 013756613 as you go conscious you watch as bodies go flying off the side and fall limp to the side of 013805533 --> 013813673 the dock their bodies still smoldering but unmoving you start flashing back to a very 013813673 --> 013819894 painful memory and caleb's eyes glaze over you are currently stunned 013819894 --> 013822454 okay that ends caleb's turn the guards that were calm are no longer calm as they see you 013830696 --> 013835577 do this the guards that were behind you charge in and all grapple both of you are you resisting 013835577 --> 013836753 no all right you are dogpiled and grappled 013839211 --> 013844116 all right damn 013859712 --> 013904014 ipess looks around at the destroyed crew saw vera go down and runs up to try and see how 013913945 --> 013923251 she's doing the remaining crew which is just the one here and this one here 013923251 --> 013929589 bouldergut's still alive barely <i>barely</i> 013933308 --> 013936341 currently the book's still in her hands there was no variation in that 013944637 --> 013945637 the book is still held there in her hand okay that's going to end the crew's turn coming 013952715 --> 013957127 back to you beauregard as you're just waiting you keep waiting 013957537 --> 014002694 don't do anything funny they turn around and start walking with you 014018753 --> 014021466 they're (grunting) trying to keep up a bit 014027797 --> 014029547 avantika takes a quick glance at the scenario and opens the hatch and charges inside 014048981 --> 014051397 of her ship 014051397 --> 014053256 at this point unless anyone's going to resist combat comes to an end and we are now at a 014109109 --> 014117035 role playing point at that moment we'll take a break unless you were doing anything 014117035 --> 014118036 we'll take a break in a second then 014123878 --> 014125163 because when it gets to nott's turn-- 014127022 --> 014129117 okay if that's the case there are four guards now no because now two of them have 014136149 --> 014139514 changed direction to go towards you and help subdue you guys there's two after you now 014139514 --> 014143271 they're both going to attempt to grapple you and stop you make two acrobatics checks 014143271 --> 014147998 ten on the first one 014150096 --> 014151595 both fail actually 014153008 --> 014154688 yeah that was a 12 and an 18 014156188 --> 014159181 this was as you were charging through there and on their turn they moved up to you 014202250 --> 014204696 your movement's zero you can't escape we'll say that happened on their turn so on the 014213515 --> 014216095 beginning of your turn you're grappled you can attempt to break free if you want to 014216095 --> 014217789 actually that's an interesting point let me pull up my new fancy player's handbook 014222053 --> 014223007 unintentional commercial but these are so awesome 014234149 --> 014237810 i think they're brick-and-mortar only so you've got to go to actual game stores 014240330 --> 014248125 it doesn't say i'll say make a check and we'll see if it's high enough for each of them 014309855 --> 014313087 no they hold tight you can't move your movement's zero they're both clutching you there 014320433 --> 014322136 on the side 014322136 --> 014325072 okay with the chaos now coming to a stop and nott prevented from escaping though that 014330214 --> 014333114 would have been a fun chase sequence now we'll go to a break 014333114 --> 014339435 man that was really intense 014344275 --> 014345733 oh there was a few things there that went differently than i expected 014349774 --> 014354484 before we go to the break we have our fantastic giveaway from our friends at wyrmwood 014402549 --> 014406705 who are giving away this leather-inset zebrawood dice tray 014406705 --> 014411848 to join the contest you have to go and jump

congratulations 020051764 --> 020055515 wonderfulmouse we'll get that sent to you asap 020055515 --> 020057866 diving back in as the rest of you stand there amongst the shipyard docks subdued by the 020107455 --> 020113953 harbor watch the revelry watch there more gather and more gather i'd say about half the 020113953 --> 020118161 watch of this city the volunteer mercenaries that take their shifts to keep their eye on their 020118161 --> 020123810 island little haven there all flood the docks to see what the hell just went down you look up and 020123810 --> 020129432 see the blackened charred sails of the ship treated against weathering but still darkened 020129432 --> 020135486 from the blast of the fireball the wood itself darkened and splintered in places you can see 020135486 --> 020143370 that giant burned u that marks the deck everything is held in place you're making your 020143370 --> 020149010 way to the guards what are you doing jester you see beau being led up by the guards towards the 020149010 --> 020150426 throne roost 020150426 --> 020158523 oh yeah you saw and heard the distant (explosion) 020203080 --> 020204093 okay the guards have now pulled you all to your feet and have begun to apply manacles to 020225974 --> 020234101 your hands not anything too aggressive but for the purpose of safety and to maintain the order 020234101 --> 020241832 within this community they're particular and careful they also go onto the deck and you see 020241832 --> 020250484 them beginning to collect the bodies of those that were killed bouldergut is inconsolable and 020250484 --> 020258556 furious and it takes a few guards to get her to calm down avantika is having a conversation with 020258556 --> 020307313 a couple of the guards you guys are being pulled away from the docks towards the city as you are 020307313 --> 020313896 brought towards the edge of it one of the guards adorned a little better than the rest have a 020313896 --> 020322479 brief discussion you overhear one of them say hold tight apparently someone's going to get the 020322503 --> 020330729 plank king while you guys are all waiting and you're going to convene with the rest of your troupe-- 020330729 --> 020332966 but go and find the vicinity 020334519 --> 020335608 there are many looky-loos on the edges of the shipyards here the docks make up probably a 020340922 --> 020347193 good third of darktow before you actually get the edge of the cliff where the city itself is built 020347193 --> 020352661 on different areas and platforms and the streets all rise at a perpetual grade as it is embedded 020352661 --> 020358056 in the side of the cliff there are folks who are looking over to see what happened usually this 020358056 --> 020403143 kind of stuff does not go down within the city you can see that people are excited and worried 020403143 --> 020407069 and making up their own stories and what they saw one of them is like it was crazy a demon 020407069 --> 020413662 fell from the sky and slammed into the boat and it was intense the rumors are going crazy 020413662 --> 020415398 that's a 7th-level spell summon gwar concert 020419917 --> 020424742 you can probably all-- they do round you up however as soon as you begin to make any physical 020444340 --> 020445877 action towards spellcasting-- 020445877 --> 020446848 it's only verbal 020447800 --> 020450988 you tell them you're going to cast a spell 020453394 --> 020456470 no spellcasting 020457968 --> 020500360 don't want any funny stuff 020502281 --> 020504272 they have after manacling taken your weapons the individuals are carrying them at 020510728 --> 020512946 their side not yours they couldn't find yours 020512946 --> 020514752 they have your crossbow and they've taken your shield and your staff 020523215 --> 020529088 there is a small perimeter being held but you could get probably within 20 25 feet or so of them 020539680 --> 020544260 okay 020545488 --> 020547970 make a performance check to see how subtly you can-- no this would be deception make a deception 020556217 --> 020557884 as you begin to subtly try and sneak your verbal components of your spell into the 020614703 --> 020620698 discussion one of the guards goes hey sorry we're making sure there's no casting this close to 020620698 --> 020623549 it if you don't mind 020623549 --> 020627903 it's best not to get involved terribly sorry about that 020632601 --> 020635095 nah that's it 020636730 --> 020639700 he's telling everyone please hold tight don't worry we're taking care of it 020648475 --> 020654325 anyway about 30 or so minutes pass for the rest of you as make your way up the steps now 020701265 --> 020708605 trying to jaunt you manage to catch up to the armored fellow who now acts as the tip of the 020708605 --> 020713430 spear essentially now you're flanked and to the front although the flanking has to shift as the 020713430 --> 020718732 space for the steps ascending to the throne roost get only wide for one person at a time you are 020718732 --> 020726579 being held at that point you make your way up to the throne roost to the shelf of stone there you 020726651 --> 020732858 see standing at the edge is the plank king himself blackened curls still dangling around his 020732946 --> 020738803 massive goliath head his long coat billowing slightly with the bit of wind that's whipping 020738803 --> 020748462 around the side of the cliff face the morning fog is burning off of the nearby reefs and you can 020748462 --> 020756146 see a little bit further out the sky itself is still dull gray looks over and goes that was 020756146 --> 020804170 quite the display wouldn't you say the guard goes right sir one of them we found at least 020804170 --> 020809907 someone running from the bit who says they have information for you he goes oh yeah no i 020809907 --> 020812411 recognize this one step forward 020812411 --> 020814279 so what's all this 020818163 --> 020823299 if you don't mind tell me what's going on 020826606 --> 020832047 he flips through the pages this is gibberish 020839186 --> 020844297 he glances through the paperwork looks at you giving him this sly grin and goes you 020910101 --> 020920372 newcomer into these waters spent less than a day amongst our people and have already attacked and 020920372 --> 020922222 stolen from one of our own as well 020922222 --> 020925074 well we'll see what she has to say to defend herself as well hang tight with me here 020932782 --> 020938318 with these men the rest of you get the rest of your guard bring her friends and bring avantika 020938318 --> 020942269 and who else had survived that massacre up here to the roost 020942269 --> 020947328 i don't trust anyone and i trust more those that i've mistrusted for years than those 020952300 --> 021000935 i've only come to mistrust and know right now so we'll see where it all lies be patient if what 021000935 --> 021004601 you say is true then we've got all time in the day 021004601 --> 021006116 i don't read a fucking piece of this but i've got a few friends who are more of a 021010405 --> 021012730 page-turning type 021012730 --> 021016701 because i wanted to see if you'd actually do something remember we don't turn on pirates here 021023191 --> 021028386 if you're right then i'll judge you based on the fact that you broke our law as soon as you 021032419 --> 021038935 got here and i'll weigh it versus how positive this tells me there's not enough well maybe you 021038935 --> 021042931 and avantika will find yourselves out there on a pike of warning 021042931 --> 021046797 make a deception check 021059315 --> 021101848 sam and okay he nods a bit 021114331 --> 021118105 so's this one he snaps his fingers and you see a cloaked figure step out of the shadows 021132747 --> 021135736 the same cloak that passed you on the stairs the night before 021135736 --> 021136965 it's jamedi hood pulled back 021140206 --> 021142736 at which point the plank king steps up towards you now looming over you a good two and 021150815 --> 021157594 a half feet of height on you this imposing presence wide like a mountain glancing down at 021157594 --> 021202400 you with a grin you can smell his early morning breath of rotting teeth and whatever he had the 021202400 --> 021212542 night before pulsing from his grin he goes i have to say for someone so small you've got some 021212542 --> 021214075 serious balls 021215810 --> 021218760 and if you survive i'm sure it won't be the last all right let's go see your friends 021225441 --> 021235407 if this is right let's hope you didn't blow up too much of <i>her</i> boat it'll be yours 021243220 --> 021245867 <i>if</i> it's enough 021249743 --> 021255470 the guards now turn and spin you around and push you back down the stairs as the plank king 021258953 --> 021305534 follows behind jamedi keeping a close watch he goes and shouts something off to the side he 021305534 --> 021313034 goes solon i'm going to need your brain for this one come on you hear a voice go all 021313034 --> 021314268 right i'm coming 021314268 --> 021316669 liam and solon s-o-l-o-n coming around the corner you see a human man probably in his late 50s 021325561 --> 021335159 early 60s bit of an unkept puff of a chin goatee his hair thinning in this big widow's peak gray 021335159 --> 021346260 to white these big spectacles around his eyes and this tattered thin mustache that's attempted 021346260 --> 021352187 to be curled into a handlebar but it seems to have split in places and is not very well kept he 021352187 --> 021357976 has this big green cloak that's wrapped around his shoulders that is so much material and 021357976 --> 021403332 billowing so widely it makes his head comparatively look much smaller he's clutching a 021403332 --> 021408330 bag and he's getting his stuff wait here i'm getting my stuff ugh they keep walking and 021408330 --> 021413227 eventually you see him trying to catch up from behind (panting) you take it this was probably 021413227 --> 021416568 what the plank king was referring to as his bookish friend 021416568 --> 021417939 as you guys are all patiently waiting here looking amongst yourselves is there anything you 021428372 --> 021437080 wish to do or are you succumbing to the hope that jester beauregard and/or possibly the plank king 021437080 --> 021441645 comes to situate this eventually you see avantika brought up from the ship in manacles as well 021441645 --> 021446017 no they shut that down 021448117 --> 021450743 it's not quite long enough to be a short rest 021455196 --> 021456202 actually you know what no it's about an hour of short rest i give that to you 021501572 --> 021502620 for the travel of beau to the front and the rest of the guard to get there for the plank king 021504996 --> 021507751 conversation for him to descend the throne roost to make his way through the city to the docks 021507751 --> 021508986 yeah that's over an hour 021508986 --> 021514240 okay as frumpkin appears on the shoulder one of the watch goes oh where'd you come from 021523965 --> 021528645 little one didn't even see you come in begins scritching frumpkin 021528645 --> 021532008 doesn't even talk to you just looks at frumpkin who's a cute little kitty we don't get 021535698 --> 021539688 cats much on this island it's good to see one wonder what ship you came aboard 021539688 --> 021543471 (laughter) 021543471 --> 021545702 eventually as the crowd begins to part you see a number of the guard a few of the bodyguards 021555647 --> 021600244 that you had seen previously sitting amongst the shadows of the throne roost when you first arrived 021600244 --> 021608387 the night before you guys came roaring into this town you definitely did there you see beauregard 021608387 --> 021615844 being flanked by three guards one better-armored than the others and then there stepping behind 021615844 --> 021627772 that the looming figure of the plank king he approaches so not here but 24 hours and you've 021627772 --> 021636018 already made a mess of our little home have you i could see the flames from my roost my crow's 021636018 --> 021642639 men tell me they spotted you walking aboard the squalleater and assault avantika one of our own 021642639 --> 021651481 apparently a few of you fleeing into the city you know i have my misgivings about trusting anyone 021651481 --> 021657484 but i'm far more likely to toss in with those that i've mistrusted long enough to at least know where 021657484 --> 021708496 they stand i don't know a fucking bit about all of you so my other friend-- and he points 021708496 --> 021716281 towards jamedi who's now in the back and the rest of you see -- says that you've all come in 021716440 --> 021722944 with her lot naught but maybe two weeks back and that not most of you have much of an experience on 021722944 --> 021732790 the sea naught but one the rest of you still haven't quite found your legs on the waters i'm 021732790 --> 021742660 going to ask you right now what brought you out there to mucking with the pirates' deals speak up 021743557 --> 021751428 he reaches back in his pocket and goes oh right here and gives it to solon who goes 021813057 --> 021819760 oh all right this is not a language i really know-- 021819760 --> 021821300 oh yeah 021822111 --> 021823664 he takes it and pulls it out looks at it oh fuck me this is-- 021827491 --> 021829942 sir with all due respect it's going to take me a long while to do this this is elaborate 021836448 --> 021839457 the plank king goes shh 021846866 --> 021849369 you said there's some special parts here of looking to overturn me or something what pages 021855366 --> 021857235 are that at 021857235 --> 021902639 solon goes oh i'd very much like to have a conversation with you 021910009 --> 021915646 you point out the space where that was 021932473 --> 021934231 thumbs through and he goes-- 021935672 --> 021936426 okay o great king give me a bit of time with this if you don't mind he looks around 021945068 --> 021950701 everyone's looking at him at this moment he glances around and sees the dozens and dozens of 021950701 --> 021953931 eyes locked on him and he starts getting a little nervous you see a little sweat drop on his 021953931 --> 021958302 forehead and he adjusts his glasses again they're starting to fog a bit he goes (clears 021958302 --> 022002439 throat) plops down and starts going through and pulls out paper and a quill he sets up in the 022002439 --> 022007086 middle of the dock area and starts going through and point-by-point deciphering and translating 022007086 --> 022010754 each part of the cipher over to one of his empty pages 022010754 --> 022013847 that we do 022015796 --> 022023088 oh we're standing right here 022029267 --> 022031088 you still haven't answered my question what brought you to these waters why'd you throw 022037177 --> 022041335 in with her lot you see now they're bringing avantika forward with the rest of you 022041335 --> 022050924 where does your allegiance lie 022129678 --> 022138921 his eyes narrow make a deception check i'll say with advantage because you did drop the 022150433 --> 022156973 cobalt soul in particular with the plank king that has meaning 022156973 --> 022159039 insight check 022201193 --> 022202676 yes for you 022204202 --> 022207575 the plank king nods and goes-- 022211846 --> 022214070 yeah you barely see through there's a hint of truth and there's a hint of not so true it's 022224288 --> 022225848 a half-truth 022225848 --> 022229246 the plank king nods and goes ah the archives i've had some dealings 022237926 --> 022241635 not much of a reader but your folk have done good work for our interests in the past so 022254316 --> 022300992 it's the woman of the hour what have you to say about yourself when these strangers have come 022300992 --> 022305829 waltzing into our little haven and causing all sorts of ruckus murdering your crew and making 022305829 --> 022317310 these claims against you known you for years avantika hand behind in shackles goes well 022317310 --> 022325714 her face you can see bits where dirt sweat lines have made their way across and down the sides of 022325714 --> 022332300 her chin and jaw looking intently at the rest of you with a forced smile through her teeth there 022332307 --> 022340081 is a look of murderous rage and loss in her eyes as you have murdered a majority of her crew she 022340136 --> 022351280 goes well i can guarantee that i kept no journal they came to me at sea with discussion of 022351280 --> 022400382 perhaps coming and joining my crew looking for means of aid and gold they began to talk of this 022400382 --> 022413421 strange entity this uk'otoa well i followed suit i wanted to make for some kind of alliance 022413421 --> 022420152 i found particular interest with one of their individuals she looks over towards fjord but 022420152 --> 022426917 it seems such a romance was merely just another way to try and toss me to the proverbial wolves 022426917 --> 022435606 or merrow if it will they've now killed my crew they've taken a number of my things damaged my 022435606 --> 022444136 ship and they're trying to smear my name one who has walked alongside you and all of you fine fine 022444136 --> 022451558 folks for the past ten years even using the memory of vandren against me you hear a few 022451558 --> 022501794 voices go like (murmuring) vandren vandren raised this one and he sabotaged his ship blew it 022501794 --> 022508294 asunder in the middle of the ocean that was the last he was seen he's already killed one of our 022508294 --> 022512508 own is this untrue 022512508 --> 022514849 yeah 022515545 --> 022520697 someone goes shh all eyes are on you 022524961 --> 022530006 make a persuasion check 022551235 --> 022552665 the plank king gives you this very severe look his eyes narrowed and glancing you up and 022609056 --> 022617400 down almost piercing you with but a glance he raises his hand with a grin and goes oh what's 022617400 --> 022619683 necessary for such a thing 022619683 --> 022621675 be my guest avantika is like what is-- 022655155 --> 022656632 she's manacled and being held by two guards from behind it's auto-hit 022703926 --> 022704995 do you have a ki point left 022708066 --> 022713536 all right what's the dc on that 022717088 --> 022723942 yeah whatever your dc is for all of your monk stuff 022726475 --> 022729292 liam sam and okay it's a wisdom save no that's a natural eight plus four 12 so all these 022745576 --> 022750177 different hits and pressure points are hit like under the chin that area another to the sternum 022750177 --> 022755639 and another that clocks the temple and avantika just ugh (heavy breathing) 022755639 --> 022802326 intimidation checks oh charisma checks yeah persuasion everything else that's right yeah 022805855 --> 022808773 she's like ugh 022814384 --> 022819197 the plank king steps forward avantika is what they're saying true she goes (frustrated 022829117 --> 022841508 grunt) glances aside doesn't respond he leans forward closer tell me 022841508 --> 022844691 is what they're saying true is that book containing passages where you're looking to take 022851295 --> 022902210 this island for yourself her eyes look away she just looks down at the rest of the dock he leans 022902210 --> 022908075 in real close pushing his forehead almost to hers look me in the eye woman 022908075 --> 022911210 she just doesn't meet his gaze hmm by the power of the revelry that surrounds me let this 022935239 --> 022947405 be a lesson to those who would work against the words we swore to each other on this land may 022947405 --> 022956651 your memory be besmirched for the few days it's recalled he reaches forward and grabs avantika 022956651 --> 023000819 by the throat and lifts her up and she's fighting against it he lifts her and looks at her i hope 023000819 --> 023007738 your sea god whatever it is is very merciful on the other side (cracking) he breaks her neck 023007738 --> 023017387 with one hand her body goes limp in his grasp and he throws it to the docks don't worry about the 023017387 --> 023026731 cipher solon goes it's actually quite interesting i'd like to continue fine 023026731 --> 023029937 and it's really well done i'm honestly very taken aback by it your penmanship is quite 023034343 --> 023035422 good as well 023035422 --> 023036066 oh certainly he goes and starts taking it at this point the plank king goes take her 023045667 --> 023058383 up top she'll be the next on the pike as for the rest of you you've pulled out a conspiracy i'll 023058383 --> 023104869 give you that you've also snuck your way into the revelry under false pretenses you've broken our 023104869 --> 023117534 laws within but a day of being presented with them in multiple ways that's a serious offense 023117534 --> 023134516 so hear my judgment upon these folk you are hereby banished from darktow take the remnants of 023134516 --> 023142522 the squalleater as your own take whatever-- he looks over towards the rest of the crew you hired 023142522 --> 023144586 who are like (panicked panting) 023144586 --> 023146751 they have had a terrible few weeks here except for orly who's sitting there smoking a 023152595 --> 023156677 pipe and his one eye goes 023156677 --> 023158034 take the ship you've thereby damaged limp your way beyond the reefs we're going to burn the 023209771 --> 023217416 colors of that ship should you ever return to the outskirts of the dragshallow we won't hesitate 023217416 --> 023221742 but sink you to the depths below 023221742 --> 023226405 unshackle them this stands immediately i hope you have enough supplies in that boat to last 023233652 --> 023235535 you the rest of the journey 023235535 --> 023237011 good tell the archives that the plank king sends his regards 023250238 --> 023254211 now fucking go 023256426 --> 023300218 okay you have to dive into the water to do so 023306677 --> 023307871 so you jump into the water make an investigation-- no this'll be a perception check 023313657 --> 023315883 with disa-fucking-vantage 023315883 --> 023317762 yeah 023318474 --> 023320302 you spend the next five or so minutes scrounging through silt and muck and barnacles and 023352561 --> 023359776 gathered bits of kelp and various other underwater plant life that has rooted itself among the rocks 023359776 --> 023405672 here you've scraped your fingers they're bleeding from digging through you find a cluster 023405672 --> 023410688 of these gems that you dropped and you climb up out of the freezing water and find one of the 023410688 --> 023415731 nearby ladders and come up looking at your quarry it is a bunch of rocks 023415731 --> 023419234 oh you don't see jester you just see an old prospector come up 023421277 --> 023422062 you guys are ushered to the squalleater your crew is ushered to the squalleater 023432725 --> 023435397 the mistake is still in repairs and at this point has been left behind 023439248 --> 023442007 the remained of them yes bouldergut is heavily manacled and is currently guarded by seven 023453651 --> 023454871 different guards 023454871 --> 023456017 all right as you guys get on the ship with your crew the ship is damaged the sails are 023521650 --> 023527563 damaged one of the masts is damaged it's going to need some repairs for it to be fully 023527563 --> 023530035 functional but you have to leave now 023530035 --> 023532132 you take your positions at the ship pull up the anchor and make your way limping through the 023539508 --> 023547134 channel of dragshallow reef back out towards the swavain islands the lucidian ocean as you slowly 023547134 --> 023552001 make your way with what little bit of wind you can pick up to bring you out there-- some of the sails 023552001 --> 023559400 are still working so you're not fully damaged but you're not optimal there are a series of 023559400 --> 023610106 these-- what are referred to as the war posts that are the clusters of driftwood and these towers 023610106 --> 023613742 that are set up along the reef and on top of the various reefs that are shallow or breach the 023613742 --> 023621860 actual surface that have cannons attached that have flares set up and beacons that can be lit to 023621860 --> 023627299 alert darktow you get a better look this time of the system they have to defend this island from 023627299 --> 023635730 the clovis concord and anybody else that would look to make their way via ship to this island 023635730 --> 023641568 you can see them at the ready keeping a very close eye on your exit as you slowly walk of shame 023641568 --> 023650640 yourselves out of the purview of the plank king and to a very carefully earned freedom 023650640 --> 023656133 okay 023720819 --> 023727299 make a general persuasion check for me just a persuasion check 023734587 --> 023735883 okay you do a number of the crew that you hired some of them look like they're a little 023742360 --> 023748146 scarred from the experience but you managed to calm them down they seem very thankful that 023748306 --> 023751935 you've pulled them-- you brought them into this mess but you pulled them out of it and there's 023751935 --> 023759557 something to that some of them begin to get back to work begin to repair some of the aspects of 023759557 --> 023805099 the ship man 023805099 --> 023807985 there are a few places but for the most part-- and it's only the one mast you still have 023820357 --> 023825356 enough sails because it's a three-mast ship you can still coast the winds but it's not going to 023825356 --> 023830733 be optimal speed you'll have to get back to some sort of a port to get the rest of the sails 023830733 --> 023836791 repaired because you don't have replacement sails the downside of the fireball the fireball and 023836791 --> 023841206 the-- actually it was a 20-foot tall wall of fire 023841206 --> 023843122 it was 023844363 --> 023846520 yeah there's a lot of sail-- you have-- 023848039 --> 023852821 i know but that's a very intense-- 023854699 --> 023855771 i would say comparatively you're limping on one full mast of functionality and the rest of 023902464 --> 023904199 the sails are partially damaged 023904199 --> 023906414 just so you know-- 023921994 --> 023924309 just so you know this ship travels on an average pace of around 48 miles a day right now 023931048 --> 023935672 with the damage the sails have sustained you're close to 20 you're less than half speed on the 023935672 --> 023943206 ship with the damage it's sustained at the sails it's going to take you a while to get anywhere 023943206 --> 023944699 but you have it 023944699 --> 023947617 they're beyond mending 023948716 --> 023949409 mending can do little tears and things 023951178 --> 023954379 for the ones that are damaged the sails are mostly destroyed they caught fire and burned 023959749 --> 024008246 doesn't quite work that way and it's temporary it's more-- 024029956 --> 024033850 to be fair i think that worked in your favor if tonight has proved anything if the end 024037175 --> 024040317 of the last campaign has proved anything counterspell's always a good choice 024040317 --> 024043736 you guys have now pushed into the rest of the seafaring mist it takes you a while to move 024059236 --> 024103306 beyond the dragshallow reef the better part of the day before you escape the channel at the pace 024103306 --> 024109395 you're moving the clouds are pretty heavy now the open sky that you enjoyed on your way to 024109395 --> 024116112 darktow has now become-- not a storm front by any means but definitely cloudier skies as you're 024116112 --> 024123654 heading outside you can see yasha smelling the

understanding and a familiar 024735325 --> 024744638 matronly guidance that brings you calm on the ocean seas that have long brought you anxiety for 024744638 --> 024748534 the first time in probably a good number of weeks you get to walk out on that deck take a deep 024748534 --> 024753309 breath of ocean air and feel really confident 024753309 --> 024803420 mm-hmm 024822530 --> 024824150 oh i'm quite familiar 024826893 --> 024830928 about as close as any direction gets really other eye even 024837936 --> 024841987 making it jump around a bit guys mm very well m-m-make sure to point this ship in that direction 024853699 --> 024854835 and you 024857802 --> 024903511 oh it's still there 024921767 --> 024927763 okay make an investigation check on that 024933239 --> 024935472 no it is not trapped 024936679 --> 024938612 the lower was 19 024952041 --> 024954569 glancing around you find-- there's her dresser with a number of outfits coats shirts 025012341 --> 025019192 things that belong to the captain that you guys get to distribute as you see fit 025019192 --> 025021428 there's a few hats yeah 025026800 --> 025028176 avantika-sized hats 025029287 --> 025033553 marisha and i will say you do find some scented oils but that's the extent 025052352 --> 025053428 she's not a perfume keeper 025055213 --> 025057452 the altar is still there the altar to uk'otoa 025102822 --> 025107891 yeah you find a few other maps and things that refer to a-- you see it breaking down the 025117922 --> 025122124 different trade routes and you see other paths breaking out those that try and avoid the trade 025122124 --> 025126051 routes to avoid the pirates those different paths they might take at different times of the year to 025126051 --> 025130566 try and head off people that are trying to avoid the waters that they're looking in you find maps 025130566 --> 025138500 that deal with the path to urukayxl and you see the handwritten map by jamedi that was the path 025138500 --> 025145309 you guys were lead through on urukayxl to find the temple you find another map that has circled 025145309 --> 025153827 heavily the archipelago that you've already sussed out and you find recent notes on that same map 025153827 --> 025200239 that refer to the loose area circled where your ship went down that time ago 025200308 --> 025206155 well you'll get near that area if you want to head that way you can let orly know to-- 025213584 --> 025215020 you find a lot of those materials you get the sense that aside from the maps most of the 025225225 --> 025227928 information that she had she kept in that book 025227928 --> 025235692 you find a number of fine cheeses actually 025238387 --> 025242614 not quite all the good food was kept for the captain and some of it's turning a little but 025247467 --> 025257845 it's cheese some better treats and some sugared candies that were kept specifically like a 025257845 --> 025300769 private stash for the captain you manage to find 025300769 --> 025306316 yeah 025807689 --> 025813572 it's going to take you about a week to get to the location that you're seeking 030150194 --> 030152414 no the island's going to take longer than that-- to get to where the last time you recall 030200104 --> 030201538 your ship going down 030201538 --> 030203748 yeah it would take a shorter time it's about eight days or so to get there eyeballing it 030207677 --> 030213143 from here i'd say more than that ten days 030213143 --> 030217452 do you have access to control water 030219073 --> 030220268 then yeah 030222498 --> 030223713 okay i'll say with the control water-- 030227641 --> 030229352 it's in the cleric list yeah 030250031 --> 030254912 between the two of you it allows you a brief moment where you can actually surge the 030300579 --> 030309821 water and grant you a speed boost i'd say that'll cut three days off of your travel-- the two of 030309821 --> 030314953 you each day spending that slot to push it it's like a speedboat burst all of a sudden your 030314953 --> 030322723 giant three-mast ship is going (crashing water) speedboating across the ocean briefly 030322723 --> 030328950 eventually you make your way to the open waters in the vicinity of-- orly goes with you 030344500 --> 030349500 each day and looks about and gives you the once-over and goes i'm pretty sure that we're 030349500 --> 030353144 pretty dang close to that place you were asking about 030353144 --> 030359161 okay it's a thousand-foot range and it has to be something familiar to you 030458749 --> 030503039 okay that's 2nd-level it lasts for ten minutes 030513805 --> 030516171 okay and how many spell slots do you have 2nd-level each 030518688 --> 030519863 so if you're both trading off it's about three chances per type of use per day how many 030530512 --> 030534170 days you want to spend looking total 030534170 --> 030535586 yeah 030536600 --> 030537969 it's up to you 030539305 --> 030541300 well these guys can summon stuff with magic if i recall 030543579 --> 030549353 altogether with the eight of them it cuts the travel time down to five days so you've got time 030916190 --> 030918436 okay so taking your time i would like you to each to roll a base wisdom check for each pass 030948669 --> 030951698 as you go through 030951698 --> 030954155 yes d20 plus your wisdom modifier 030958081 --> 030959713 okay again 031005341 --> 031008148 this is just check add your wisdom modifier 031015272 --> 031017005 okay roll again your third spell slot of the first day hitting this space and scanning the load 031032399 --> 031033364 okay and you're utilizing your memory of passage through here as well as orly's direction 031042738 --> 031050155 on this ocean go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me 031054848 --> 031056434 okay first day goes through nothing catches your attention you pass around and then 031105577 --> 031111291 once you make it quite past the area based on the measurements where you think that you recall it 031111291 --> 031118127 happening the next day you make a curved turn and begin to head out to see some more land as 031118127 --> 031125828 you can to widen the perspective of your search for the second day roll again 031127387 --> 031129087 three in a row yeah unless you want to use more spell slots to do more so you can do your 031133159 --> 031135009 3rd-level to burn as well 031135009 --> 031137820 (sneezes) pardon me thank you (sneezes) pardon thank you 031149212 --> 031150849 i am at least 031152952 --> 031154682 sure 031159258 --> 031202373 go ahead and roll an intelligence check for you as well 031207958 --> 031209570 okay you go through the second day and towards the end you caduceus sense a brief 031228556 --> 031235874 moment where something ship-related catches your attention and then is gone 031235874 --> 031238159 vague direction 031244904 --> 031246075 yeah you're moving so it's like all right let's go ahead and turn it around 031248808 --> 031251369 you turn the ship back in the direction of where it goes at the very end of the second day 031256379 --> 031304665 just as dusk is starting to creep in you make your way back in the area and you sense another hit 031304665 --> 031309037 okay as you're attempting to find the orb roll a wisdom check 031316961 --> 031320917 okay you lose your concentration on the locate object 031323599 --> 031328697 you circle around again you've closed off a distance but you haven't quite located the 031335039 --> 031340035 specific area yet you're trying to guide into a vicinity i mean it's hard to really remember 031340035 --> 031345455 specifically where when it's just open water and a storm looming especially so you get to a 031345455 --> 031348911 certain point where you're like i'm not sure i'm being able to help but you're starting to get 031348911 --> 031354181 something you're not entirely sure the divination seems to be helping or this aspect of 031354181 --> 031402762 your locate spell evening comes to a close you ride the night out the clouds are still thick 031402762 --> 031409148 the next morning you can attempt again if you like both of you 031409148 --> 031411732 make another intelligence check for me as well 031420441 --> 031421979 okay roll again 031440332 --> 031442879 this is your second spell slot used today 031444500 --> 031445529 okay 031452391 --> 031454503 okay between the 21 and your 20 intellect in guiding the ship around you find yourself now 031459238 --> 031503829 collecting a secondary blip once again on the ship not on the eye 031503829 --> 031505124 you're concentrating on the orb or the ship 031506793 --> 031508171 the ball you find nothing 031510924 --> 031519319 so you create a frumpkin octopus 031639979 --> 031647090 (splashing) frumpkin makes his way in the darkness 031653118 --> 031656839 okay how long does it last 031658782 --> 031703711 okay make a perception check for frumpkin 031728024 --> 031729244 okay about an hour goes by nothing roll again 031741165 --> 031742687 frumpkin goes beyond your visual range for a bit you start getting worried and then frumpkin 031751523 --> 031757171 returns and is making his way quickly towards the ship 031757171 --> 031759606 100-foot is the connection 031800883 --> 031801984 technically the distance doesn't matter for what you can see through his eyes it's a 100 feet 031811459 --> 031812596 for it to communicate 031812596 --> 031816486 correct during that time so yeah you watch through frumpkin's eyes as he makes his way 031825249 --> 031836147 toward the-- finally finding the floor of this ocean over this second hour of his search he 031836147 --> 031842991 catches one shape that is emerging like an obelisk on the bottom of the ocean upon getting close 031842991 --> 031853356 enough you can see it looks to be the front of a wrecked ship itself damaged and caked in 031853356 --> 031902944 minerals ocean floor plant life barnacles it appears to be a damaged ship 031906214 --> 031908370 okay frumpkin does a circle on it before feeling confident that he's discovered at least 031944043 --> 031950775 something of interest and then beelines it back to the squalleater 031950775 --> 031957792 then frumpkin is now there at the surface of the water without really a way getting back into 032000893 --> 032002041 the ship 032002041 --> 032003788 yeah there you go back in your shoulder 032005561 --> 032012337 over an hour 032103340 --> 032106523 like just barely from the distance where you are now it'd be just under a thousand if you 032112119 --> 032117603 were right over but you're not entirely certain how far the boat isn't set for that currently 032117603 --> 032119534 you've got weight 032142253 --> 032144705 the stuff that you found at urukayxl 032258260 --> 032259681 that would be amazing 032300757 --> 032302582 you look up and on the side there's the plank king and avantika looking at him he's like 032320372 --> 032322029 where you'd find these people 032322029 --> 032326251 (laughter) 032326251 --> 032333385 well once you make it in the ocean you'll find out noticeably yasha is energized with the 032353528 --> 032401375 coming of the storm seems to be in more energetic spirits than you're used to seeing her you guys 032401375 --> 032405755 complete your meal for breakfast you gather your supplies what are you going to do 032405755 --> 032411426 okay 032457089 --> 032458215 all right all of you now have the capability for the next 24 hours to breathe 032524724 --> 032531292 underwater your lungs feel heavier than they do while you breathe air it's unique no gills 032531292 --> 032537399 sprout from the side of your neck per se but the air itself seems to have a weight to it and 032537399 --> 032543051 you're like (exhales) it's still breathable air but the process seems to have changed a bit 032543051 --> 032544400 there's no sand to fill them with out in the ocean unfortunately 032555970 --> 032557273 as a note too when the squalleater came to port that night darktow was resupplied with 032612415 --> 032616650 cannonballs on board for those who are keeping track which would be-- 032616650 --> 032617686 you the ship currently has a cache of 30 cannonballs 032624233 --> 032627829 okay you maneuver the boat slowly also closer to where frumpkin saw because when frumpkin 032642472 --> 032646410 found it it was at an angle away from you which is how it was just beyond the range of a thousand 032646410 --> 032652012 feet moving over it's probably close to 700 feet below 032652012 --> 032656005 okay 032657210 --> 032659759 it's not going to go that far 032712126 --> 032716163 dancing lights you cast light on 032731817 --> 032732895 yasha casts light on her sword the magician's judge 032735136 --> 032736434 to the point where you're intoxicated 032741506 --> 032743090 okay 032743983 --> 032752217 this poor little-- it's better over the days that it's been able to spend with you since 032811317 --> 032815605 darktow but this ferret's been through quite a few experiences 032815605 --> 032823127 (ferret chattering) then he curls up he hears a loud noise (startled chittering) 032826144 --> 032827365 hmm i can't remember which eye it is anymore i'll have to go check mmm 032836370 --> 032841912 why 032848741 --> 032852481 you watch as orly's head retracts into the shell slightly with this look of-- 032859344 --> 032901047 marius steps up and goes like i'm happy to look after him actually been quite a while since 032907100 --> 032909004 i've seen a pet 032909004 --> 032910350 marius lepual 032912001 --> 032915289 he does look a little more ocean-wearied as prim and proper and put together as marius was at 032926269 --> 032930272 nicodranas he's definitely rocking more of a pirates of penzance thing now 032930272 --> 032934393 of course 032937772 --> 032944267 are those the only options 032951362 --> 032953375 okay hello-- oh (nervous laughter) 032956632 --> 033003020 right 033004311 --> 033007429 okay well come let's get you some cheese and-- oh that's my hand you're peeing in okay 033017149 --> 033018771 he carries him off all right you gather your supplies you gather your cannonballs 033022181 --> 033024313 as it stands the cannonballs are smooth solid metal how are you bringing them down with you 033041505 --> 033042761 that can be done you do have a few sacks 033055231 --> 033102151 i'll allow it yeah 033110372 --> 033112023 as you place the dagger against it there's a brief moment where the dagger seems to shift 033116202 --> 033120405 energy and you slip it inside of it and at that point the handle is now solid with the 033120405 --> 033124973 cannonball so one cannonball has a handle another one a sack around it actually a few of 033124973 --> 033126818 them you can put sacks around it so-- 033126818 --> 033128772 yeah she's coming with you 033139355 --> 033144408 you splash and break the surface of the ocean as you all begin to sink slowly beneath the 033206532 --> 033212297 waves the light begins to get darker and darker the further down you pass the shades of 033212297 --> 033220677 green-blue begin to turn to a deep green-brown and even that light begins to fade just having 033220677 --> 033226331 the few points of light that you are bringing along with yourselves towards the bottom of the ocean 033226331 --> 033229523 nott has not taken a breath yet actually 033235253 --> 033237202 you get to a point nott where your lungs hurt so much you cannot help but breathe in and 033243371 --> 033247090 there is a moment of panic as suddenly water rushes into your lungs and the nightmare you've 033247090 --> 033249287 had many times kicks in 033249287 --> 033254057 it takes a little bit to adjust and anxiety is still spiked in you but you begin to find 033307369 --> 033312715 yourself breathing water in and out-- like thicker air but still air-- and it's more comfortable 033312715 --> 033314887 than you expected 033314887 --> 033316565 you can 033317611 --> 033318521 it doesn't have the same volume you do above water which means you can cast spells underwater 033323756 --> 033324609 without issue 033324609 --> 033325185 yes same as you had before it carries vibration and sound travels far but it loses 033333141 --> 033339293 enunciation at longer distances but you can hear voices longer 033339293 --> 033343685 oh this is going to be awful 033354569 --> 033359388 your feet find the bottom of the ocean after minutes ten minutes who knows how much time has 033414277 --> 033418294 past it seemed longer than you expected until you eventually you hit the bottom of the ocean 033418294 --> 033420041 you see the faint bit of light above where it marks where the sunlight is hitting the waves 033425829 --> 033434720 but it's an impossible distance from you from this perspective there are heavy slowly shifting 033434720 --> 033446062 arms waving tassels of kelp and sea vegetation slightly drifting and moving with every faint bit 033446062 --> 033452512 of water that gets maneuvered through with each wave and push as it goes and you can feel it move 033452512 --> 033458006 you a few inches and you have to readjust as each one pushes through 033459876 --> 033502607 you realize there shouldn't be waves this deep necessarily 033507719 --> 033509335 you glance over and watch as a large creature is not that far away from you 033517021 --> 033519288 you hear a faint (whale singing) and glance over the left you can see a whale making its way 033533992 --> 033537812 through the water about 50 60 feet from you 033537812 --> 033539108 not with a-- 033540672 --> 033542719 he still has the light you can still see caduceus and yasha still have the light on their weapons 033552231 --> 033558793 the whale continues on slowly moving not really acknowledging your presence you can see 033604378 --> 033606828 two other smaller whales alongside it 033606828 --> 033608731 everyone make an investigation check this will be perception underwater perception 033623480 --> 033624999 yep 033626475 --> 033627988 roll for yasha as well 033639437 --> 033642269 oof all right overall party not so great it takes you a little while about two to three 033649987 --> 033655389 hours of searching the bottom of the ocean you're starting to get a little hungry again from all the 033655389 --> 033701943 strenuous activity of moving and dragging these cannonballs with you to keep you weighted down so 033701943 --> 033707312 you can step across the surface you come past some deep sea corals and beautiful colorful 033707312 --> 033713016 visions and schools of fish scooting and coasting around at one point they swarm past you and you 033713016 --> 033720303 feel them tickling past your torso before they skitter past eventually this lift begins to 033720303 --> 033728791 descend into a small bowl or at least a point where the shelf begins to head in a downward 033728791 --> 033736773 direction at a decline within the next 15 or so minutes of traveling in that direction you see 033736773 --> 033743141 the outline of a familiar ship 033743141 --> 033747813 all right as you all gather in behind fjord making your way in the direction of this long 033754139 --> 033756687 forgotten shipwreck we'll pick it up there next week 033756687 --> 033759420 (groaning) 033801093 -->

like oh they planned so terribly every d&ampd game everyone plans 033952482 --> 033957390 terribly sometimes plans go great and those are the ones you remember when you compare it to other 033957390

judging other people's plans 034006980 --> 034010839 yeah everyone has some good plans every now and then more often than not plans go pretty shitty 034010839 --> 034017889 and that's fun anyway thank
