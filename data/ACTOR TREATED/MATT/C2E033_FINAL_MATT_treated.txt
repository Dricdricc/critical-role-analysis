critical role theme] mighty nein as you close the final miles to the outskirts of the northern side of nicodranas the first and one of the major port towns in the menagerie coast what would you like to do make an insight check you haven't made it to the gates of the city yet you're probably about 20 or so minutes from reaching the exterior of nicodranas if you were to head straight south as opposed to continuing on the somewhat southwestern path towards the city you would eventually hit the shoreline on the eastern side of the city for about 40 45 minutes or so to get there so heading southward deviating from the path that leads directly into nicodranas the mighty nein makes their way southward towards the shoreline the better part of an hour passes you can see to the right the exterior walls of the city and beyond the somewhat light gray to white patterned walls they may have been gray at one point but the white pattern you can see across them seems to be layers and layers and years and years of seagull excrement having gathered stronger towards the southern side of the wall as you pass near that section of the city okay what do you look like okay human jester okay great continuing on this way you begin to see the seagulls now new birds for a lot of you here you can see these white (cawing) going overhead as they begin to cluster and hit the shoreline you see a few of them diving towards the water as you begin to look past the edge of the rock into the sand bank you can see eventually as your cart begins to make its way towards the rougher bit of terrain before it breaks at the ocean the actual waves now crashing up against the shore and now pulling away pushing again okay yeah looking past the afternoon sun at this vantage point especially you can see it dancing across the distant horizon shore like hundreds of little glistening flecks of glass the shore's sound itself is very soothing as you approach and pull up your pants and take off your boots to begin to step into the soft sand you can see large rocks that occasionally break up the beach itself that jut outward and on these you can see small carvings you can see things that have been drawn on them with chalk it looks like that have been mostly washed away or eroded with time as close as maybe 150 feet out you see a small fishing ship that is on the outskirts of the southern portion of the city glancing off to the right to where the city docks begin you can see dozens of ships that are in the middle of the harbor that are coming into the harbor many that are in the process of being anchored and then set up within the docks themselves this eastern side you recognize as the restless wharf of the city and you know the harbor is broken into two different sides make an investigation check you find a lot of really soft sand you start putting it into piles and then you start building a cool little mound and a wave comes and destroys it and you're a little sad but that's how life works okay yeah there's the-- the rocks are pretty disparate amongst the shore here there is one section where you can see a string of four rocks at different heights that eventually get to about 30 or so feet out into the shore before they disappear beneath the ocean surface so before you even touch the water you dive on up to one of the rocks and as you get to the top your hands hit there and you can already see the top of the rock is bleached white with seagull shit but it's dry glancing over the side you make a leap to the next one make an athletics check yeah you can just walk right into it it's an open beach right here 25 you deftly leap from rock to rock until eventually you get to the final one it's maybe breaking about three or four feet out of the water and you're perched on it and looking out in the distance you can see the rolling waves coming in you can see-- just like that yeah it's a beautiful sight the sun maybe has a few more hours before it begins to become full dusk and the colors begin to shift in the sky but for you having never seen the ocean for many of you it's serene it's different it's beautiful it's warm and caduceus as you put your feet into the water it is quite cool it isn't freezing it's a comfortable temperate temperature you feel the sand grip and slowly dissipate between your toes as you pull it in it's a really unique sensation and you can't help but be excited by it okay you watch as caleb-- caleb slowly submerges entirely into the ocean up to the neck or fully submerged eventually you see caleb vanish beneath the ocean there's a brief moment of worry as a few seconds pass with no sight before you see (bloop) buoyantly finding his way to the surface as you crouch down you notice the clothing you place as caleb begins to shift moving slowly to one side you pull it up and you see beneath it a large sand crab that emerges from underneath it looks up at you with two small black beads for eyes and the claws (snapping) make a dexterity check 11 it rolled exactly an 11 on its dexterity so you manage to just capture it it's going to attempt to snipe at you that's a 17 to hit with the armor class your thumb clamps down and there's an immediate flash of pain through your body as you're trying to shake it off it's still whipping back and forth holding on tightly okay make an acrobatics check ten thankfully it rolled lower than you it takes you a little bit of effort it takes you two or three leaps because it keeps skittering out of the way and you're not about to be bested by a small crustacean for the third try you manage to get just enough leverage as you push into the air and with one resounding crack down through its external shell it releases its grip somewhat on your thumb you have to actually pry it off it seems to be locked into its death grip okay and over the next ten minutes or so you watch as one seagull comes down eats and grabs it (whooshing) about 25 of them suddenly descend as word gets out and you're surrounded by white birds we'll say for the sake of narrative you manage to pick off about eight of them before they end up scattering away from it you have this beach riddled with dead seagulls with crossbow bolts out of their bodies in the cart i believe if you guys are doing some training what are you training him in it's going to take you a couple hours of working with him here on the beach but you can do that make an animal handling check okay utilizing bits of the feed and the snacks that you had purchased off of the original vendor with sprinkle tucked up in your neck and they're focused on their various endeavors jester's tunnel vision focused on this adorable little blink dog the fur is a light tan color with bits of faintly darker brown stripes and a hint of calico elements to its coat but very faint along the back oversized puppy paws that look soft and goofy but the limbs themselves are a little unnaturally angular for a natural dog you can see some of its fey nature peeking through in its features its ears are very tall and pointed though wide at the base as you start teaching it to blink you watch as it prepares each time and as it begins to figure out the commands and what you're trying to guide the eyes begin to go from a dark black to a bright blue right before it blinks over here and the eyes fade from blue to black as soon as it manages to find its next location over the next two hours or so of you working with this you begin to eventually develop the early stages of finding ways to command it to teleport when you want it to although you can't really guide where it's going to teleport yet but you've learned a command or a whistle of your choice that will tell it to blink so you get to decide on that did you name your owl what did you name your owl do you meditate for the full two hours that she's training the blink dog or do you return to professor thaddeus in the cart okay so you stand about 50 yards from the cart and hold aloft your forearm and attempt to find a way to coax professor thaddeus roll an animal handling check okay 21 over the next hour and a half or so you realize that your owl won't just come to you you begin to find coaxing it with pieces of meat that you scavenge from the remnants of the meal you're waving the seagull it seems a bit large but eventually in smaller pieces you begin to realize you can coax it and you can get it to come to you when you have a piece of food in your grasp yeah you've begun the process of forming a bond with your animal thaddeus seems to already have a stronger bond with caduceus than you while this chaos is happening with caduceus slowly wading through the shoreline caleb floating in the distance practically nude nott diminishing the population of the various waterfowl and those two training their pets what are you doing fjord as the falchion emerges from whatever pocket space it resides when not in use there's a splash of ocean water across the ground flung from the very faint bit of force that is released upon its summoning as you hold it in your grasp and hold it before you looking at it for a moment the sunlight gleaming off the blade showing the intricacies of its curvature of the falchion summer's dance mutation that has come from the consuming of the blade not long ago it feels cold same temperature of the ocean that you're currently sitting in and as the temperature of the ocean warms to your touch so does the temperature of the blade you're holding i'd say he's about 15 feet out not too far yes you may caleb as you've been lying there looking up into the beautiful blue sky with faint tufts of white drifting by but mostly this unending sphere of blue color before you fjord just appears a shadow above you looming in the water as a unique visual perspective here too as caleb is no longer just floating buoyant but who has probably not had too much experience swimming in the past is having to haphazardly thrash-- it's closer to 20 we'll say enough to the point where you can submerge and touch your feet underneath but to stay above the water you're talking as you thrash fjord is gently buoyant occasionally putting the hands in the water the armor itself keeping you mostly aloft by its enchantment and just being comfortable in the water it's fjord looming over as you're keeping up with him best you can as you guys are having this discussion you watch as this beacon of pink hair emerges from the water next to you as you continue talking the voice creeps through and goes jester i only received a portion of what you were saying but i am singing tonight are you nearby this side of the coast it would be-- because where you are on the ocean it would be setting in the west you have multiple moons from the menagerie coast the sun does set in the ocean as you guys gather your things dusk has set in and now the sky shifts from light blue to a deep blue and purple on the eastern side as the oranges reds yellows and pinks begin to overtake the western side of the skyline are you heading back to the main road to one of the entrances to the eastern gate of the city or are you heading towards the coastline to the actual wharf itself probably the wharf okay you head along the coastline eventually finding your way to where the wall itself slowly diminishes in steps it does extend out into the ocean there is no direct path where you can walk along the shore and go into the city it is specifically marked off there is an archway there that is gated by two of the guards that run the city okay you do see about six zolezzo that are currently guarding that entrance the rest of you see armored guards varying from the scalemail and the maroons and muted colors of the townsguard you're used to seeing in the empire here the zolezzo have a blue and green base but you can see on the armor each individual zolezzo has their own unique decoration and flair to it some way of customizing it making it their own as such even within their own ranks there is a sense of color and individuality and their own armored senses that doesn't mean they're not still armed and wondering who the fuck you are as you approach the exterior of the city as your cart begins to approach four of the six zolezzo immediately raise their weapons and they begin to approach halt what is your business in nicodranas the one at the front you can see beneath his helmet which has these two bits of chainmail that curl open like curtains on each side of his face he pulls them out of the way and looks forward towards the rest of the crew there you can see his darker skin and his thick brow it's almost like a unibrow that sits over sun-dried lips that are a bit cracked and parched he glances forward looks over the rest of you and goes the ruby of the sea make a persuasion check 15 okay he goes all right and where do you hail from port damali is from the other side but it's fine he goes all right it's roundabout and you are now make a deception check he looks back to the rest of the zolezzo and they discuss for a moment for themselves and he says well i apologize but there is no entry after dark on this side of the wharf regardless if you want to enter you have to enter from the main gates well then you'll have to find some way to make it through the gate he holds his hand out you put five gold in his hand he shakes it in his palm very well let them in to the side they have a portcullis that is held up by some sort of chain mechanism that is beyond the wall they step aside and let you in they usher you through quickly because nobody's supposed to come through this entrance as they all walk by you can see them all looking each of you up and down taking a mental note of what you have on you who you are what you look like as well as what they perceive to be inside the cart a few strange faces at the cluster of creatures around jester and the rather disinterested looking owl that's clutching the forearm bracer of beauregard you pass through this archway on the exterior wall and immediately look before you and you can see the eastern side of the harbor here what is known as the restless wharf immediately before you you can see a plethora of people that are walking along this heavy dockside harbor there are a number of warehouses and small huts and buildings that are built both on the dock and built along the side of where it adjusts from stone and sand into wood and elements that turn into the docks themselves you can see tall cranes made of wood and cord and rope some of them ten feet some of them 25-30 feet or so that are in the process of either loading or off-loading various materials from the trade ships that are making their way into harbor or loading up to leave in the morning you see two or three larger guild buildings that tend to be the hubs of information for those that are coming from the docks there are a few dockmasters that are walking around who are in the process of taking down information of who it is entering or exiting with their ships making sure that everything is being handled and you see a number of zolezzo that are also keeping a close eye torches are now lit as the sky grows darker and there's one that's going through the city and lighting the actual oil lanterns that hang on these tall thin poles that dot the city that have to be lit at dusk one thing that does catch your eye is right towards the center of this harbor where the restless wharf would be transitioning into what you know as the open quay which is the other half of this harbor there is a massive lighthouse that sits on this one bit of rock that protrudes where the docks come to an end and an element of the stone floor continues out before breaking off into a shelf into the ocean below you can see this beautiful lighthouse you know it as the mother's lighthouse it catches your attention specifically caduceus because the beautiful design of this lighthouse while it seems natural and a gradual tower-like point on the back side on the northern side the southern side that faces the ocean has a 20-foot relief of the upper torso of a woman that is emerging from the lighthouse looking out over the ocean a beautiful sculpture with wild hair that tangles and curls around the shoulders and then merges in with the stonework of this lighthouse but what's unique is the way the lighthouse itself is placed as it rotates as the light beacon comes across you watch as the eyes of the woman flare up as the light passes that side of the tower you recognize the closer you get to this area this large sculpture is that of the wildmother of melora that is where the mother's lighthouse title comes from you guys are making your way through the restless wharf and getting odd looks from the side of various sailors and dockhands that are curious as to who you are and how you made your way here are you heading directly to-- okay that being the case-- yeah you've spent a bit of time here it's a little over 400 450 miles from here it's quite a distance yeah along the menagerie coast port damali is the westernmost port city which is why it's the largest here it's the major hub of trade between all the western bits of civilization-- tal'dorei marquet issylra-- with the port town nicodranas being the furthest east the two of those mark the two endpoints the bookends of the menagerie coast there are a few other port towns in between but they're smaller by comparison and nicodranas is about half the size of port damali make a perception check nine everyone seems to be going about their business you are drawing some attention from folks as it is their job there are a few zolezzo that keep an eye as you pass by you see one male dwarf figure that appears to probably be the wharfmaster who has a number of people talking to him who watches you pass by and as he does so he scribbles something in a book and then goes about his business but that's the most you notice you pass beyond the restless wharf heading north-northwest into the city eventually the hustle and bustle of the docks begin to fade the warehouses begin to slowly diminish their overtaking of the central business area of the city and you come upon a large 15-foot tall stone archway it's a gradual arch as opposed to being straight and then turning over it's a slow gradual arch there with a large gem embedded at its peak at its zenith there are eleven of these throughout the district these if you were to recount what information of history you know about the city here the opal archways once marked the-- goddamn it there you go they once marked the exterior of the original city-- i will fucking kill you never mind you don't get lore i can give and i can take away no the opal archways mark what were the original boundaries of the city when it was first founded and the city has expanded far beyond that but that now marks the richer most lively district where a lot of the political elite where a lot of diplomats and the wealthy merchants come to either live and/or spend their money you pass beyond this archway the original occasional set poles that hold the oil lanterns that give the faint bit of flickering firelight through these dark cobblestone streets give way to much more vibrant magical baubles that hover about ten feet above the air they've already been set and you see them give off a brighter glow and the colors seem to shift one of them has a whiter color but then slowly turns to an orange then shifts to a green about ten feet away on the other side of the street you see another one that's colors are shifting but in a different pattern so they're kind of complementing and also contrasting each other at this point too you begin to see the streets-- while not as crowded as the wharf people that are here are much better dressed you see a carriage make its way by to your right and you see a few folks that appear to be well-dressed nobles of some kind wearing a crushed silk-type clothing that is bright blues and purples and jewelry of all sorts of gems and colors compared to a lot of the drab decor that a lot of the noble families wear in your experiences up in the empire the cultural mishmash that tends to build here on the coast over time with so many people coming from so many places it all has built this mixing pot of styles and ideas and self-expression and it immediately is visible in the people that live here you do notice strangely that there are a few townsguard among the zolezzo here crownsguard crownsguard of the empire correct they look like they're keeping an eye out and you two have had the experience here crownsguard do have a small presence here because nicodranas is the closest to the empire it's also the crossover point where the two entities-- the clovis concord that oversees the menagerie coast and the dwendalian empire-- make their laws and agreements and all of their essential intent to not attack undermine or destroy each other takes place so while the laws of the clovis concord are enforced here technically the crownsguard can enforce imperial law if they were to see anything that does break imperial law however their presence is much thinner than anywhere else in the empire and it's more of a courtesy given to them by the concord to make them feel more comfortable in the city that is closest here that's largely why this city here in nicodranas is considered a popular escape for those who want to get away it's the vegas of the dwendalian empire where it's close enough they can go travel to and still enjoy a bit of comfort and some semblance of home in places but it's still different and alien and unique enough to the point where it feels like a vacation they're more on duty though you're not sure if it's their own duty or if they've been given some sort of post specifically by whoever's paying them but it catches the rest of you who aren't familiar with this sight a little off-guard and you immediately adjust your posture and get into a little more of a naturally defensive position knowing that there is now two forces of law enforcement now looking to the streets of the archways in passing further through the opal archways district you begin to hear the music of various street buskers and performers beginning to take to the roads they have their own lighting arrangements and you see a small-- what's the word for it a topped cart a vardo thank you well it would be on yours a vardo tucked into one corner where there is a small group of about four performers out there doing juggling acts it reminds you of the early days when you had first come across the carnival in trostenwald most everyone in the street doesn't pay them mind occasional silver is tossed their way passing that still you go by a building that catches your attention immediately this gaudy nearly a palace of an estate you see this large building white silk-draped dull brass and orange-yellow stone a sandstone base construct of a building you know this you've passed it before but you're uncertain this is the marquis demesne this is where the marquis of the city lives even at a glance you can see that there's probably well over 40 rooms within this establishment it looks like a small compound with three low towers four or five story towers two at the front and one towards the back that's the taller of the three all one singular building it looks like a palace small for a palace but too large for a mansion it's that weird in-between state a lot of money has gone into its construction and the closer you get to it you can see that maybe it's not in the best of upkeep but what you do notice is that the presence of zolezzo is very strong there's probably about 20 or more zolezzo that are in the process of keeping an eye on the vicinity walking around the boundaries of the exterior of the demesne you can see eight or so that are stationed at the front and a few that are walking along the upper parapets or high walls keeping an eye down on the street yeah it can vary but you get the sense-- make a history check actually you get the sense that there's probably a handful of diplomats that are staying there as guests and that's why the guard is a little more heightened than normal as you curve around the bend of the exterior of demesne you see before you what is considered the high-end inn of the opal archways you see this beautiful three-story thin but very tall building of soft sky blue pigment that's been painted across the stone and each windowsill you can see this gold-leafed wooden frame that dangling from it is a deep cerulean crushed velvet curtain that open up across glass windows that appear to be stained glass and glowing from the inside emanate this slightly shifting kaleidoscope of color from the inside out the steps that lead up to the front double doors which are currently open emanate a very soft sound of music a four five piece band apparently playing gentle atmospheric music to the interior this is a very familiar sight to you jester as this is the lavish chateau this is where you grew up this is your home you know disguise self lasts an hour right it's been over an hour but i'll say that you've kept it up but mark off two more 1st-level spell slots for the time it's taken to travel since you arrived at the ocean from traveling from the ocean to the city and making your way through it's been the better part of an hour so it would be two spell slots yeah a little over an hour since you left the beach from what you recall they request weapons be noted you can keep a weapon on your person as a means of self-defense but you cannot come in fully decked out ready for armor you can have one small personal item on yourself as a means of self-defense everything else can be kept at a coat room at the entrance you also do see two zolezzo that are stationed on either side of the open doorway that is part of the protective presence here at the inn and the higher-end customers that they see make an intelligence check he can adjust his height that's part of the disguise self ability that he has no it's a racial trait of a firbolg okay you've taken a bit of time to study the accouterments and fashion of those around you in the city specifically those that appear to be common denizens of nicodranas as you emerge with caleb you see caleb in this beautifully clean well-pressed coat with a higher collar a wider sleeve and with cuff you can see a bit of a cravat poofing from beneath a very nice presence and you see with the same pink hair-- how would you like to be dressed all right so you almost look like one of the ghosts from pac-man okay perfect as you approach and begin to step out of the cart you see a young human man in his early 20s or so his hair gelled back but it tends to curl up and poof a bit towards the base and around the sides of his neck he's wearing a vest with a plain but well-made silk white shirt and a pair of trousers you recognize him as tyral he is essentially the front hand of the inn as he approaches he looks up to you are you leaving your cart here are you going to be staying all right well i will see that this is taken care of please enter we can there is a charge um sets it on the railing of the stairway on the side and goes very well i will see and tend to the horses and your hawk ow ow ow this is actually to pay for the service he doesn't say how much do you give him boarding the animals and taking care of the cart all right you drop five gold in his hand and his eyes go wide he's like oh of course right this way he seems to be immediately swallowing the pain from the talons that are grinding into his forearm and is now smiling brightly and eager to please the new arrivals on the outskirts as she's saying this a dark spot is slowly spreading across it is a male it would be a steven your cart is taken care of one of your animals has found a temporary companion you make your way up the steps the zolezzo keep an eye out and nod as you pass walking into the interior the warm light and music embrace you as you step within the lavish chateau the first thing you see are four chandeliers hanging from the ceiling in different corners of this very tall chamber about 15 or so feet from floor to ceiling there are rafters that align with a series of wide wooden bars that hang from the right to left side and the chandeliers that hang from them appear to be made of a polished silver color and on them hang about 20 or so candles per chandelier that are giving off this gently flickering warm light that trickles down into the main area you see two bars one to the right and one to the left in the far corners with each being tended to by one bartender you see a few servants that are jogging from table to table and ten or so tables you're used to the dark wood taverns and the dives in various degrees all the tables here have fine very high-count white cotton or a white dupioni silk that is pulled across and around these circular tables and across them a silver platter that contains candles fresh fruit complimentary slivers of cheese and crackers that are set out there there aren't a lot of people in here there's maybe nine patrons that are currently in the tavern but those that are in here are very well dressed they're clustered around three separate tables three three and three at three different tables dupioni silk it's a type of silk material that has an interesting texture to it i'll show you at the break it looks a little rougher than just smooth silk it has a bit of a texture to it and it looks a little more natural there you go exactly you see ten tables in the room total yes though the clientele can shift based on time as you enter and look around on the far end there is a single staircase a wide ten-foot staircase that ascends up towards the back wall and then splits in two different sides into two separate staircases that ascend to the second level along that you can see all the wood painted in a faint gray or very light tan color there is a carpeting that is draped over the center about eight-foot wide down the staircase that is a similar light blue color as the paint on the exterior of the building on the exterior yes on the interior it's a light tan and medium wood tint with whites and gold and silver as you guys have been standing in the middle of the foyer area you're pushed ahead by another group of about four individuals they look to be merchants well-dressed for the occasion and they push passed ah excuse me they go and find another table and you get the sense that the room probably is going to be filling up your mom actually descends for her performance so you'd have to go upstairs okay just you all right so you guys all find a table okay you guys all find a table you ascend the stairs with the normal route you're used to taking which is to the right of the stairs' split towards the second floor you can see on the brief landing before it goes up to the second floor there is another zolezzo guard who's stationed there keeping an eye out he looks to you nods you run up to the secondary floor where there are a number of various rooms for the inn that are for rent you head up the next flight of stairs as they both meet in the center there's this second flight that mirrors the bottom floor parallel on the floor upward that one splits again on the top floor and there as you get to the third and final floor of the chateau on the left side there are a number of inn doors but there is one doorway that is made of a different wood grain than the rest of them it was a gift from a very interested suitor years ago and it has been installed but it marks the chamber where the ruby of the sea makes her home and for most of your life until recently you made yours okay you go up to the door you can hear muffled through the doorway a little bit of practiced singing some scales some la la la la la you hear other voices talking and there's some rustling moving through someone seems to stub a toe and goes ow we're trying-- and there's a few other people rushing around in there there's a pause and the door creaks open you can see one of the servants who works within the chateau an older woman in her forties human with very short crimped dark hair who generally helps prep your mother helps her get dressed and helps get her prepared for the performance glances past her name is-- actually let me look it up nadine she peeks through looking at you i'm terribly sorry what did you say unfortunately she is going to be performing shortly she is not-- you hear a voice from behind her go i'm sorry what from peeking over her shoulder as your vision focuses into the chamber beyond low lit beyond the series of candles that are set around the single mirror you see the beautiful red skin of your mother and the dark hair tumbled past the shoulder as she's been wearing a mostly laced up bodice as the other servant is in the process of lacing and tying it glances over her shoulder and pushes past the edge of the chair you see her smile brightly her faintly white glowing hint of yellowish-gold tint to her eyes brighten immediately and goes well come in please close the door nadine closes the door and goes i'm very confused by this mistress but whatever you require at which point the other one who's lacing is still pulling on the back of the bodice and without even looking at her marion pushes her aside shh as you give her a hug she holds you there and goes you look different there's a nod and the tension in her body melts as her arms close around your shoulders and back and pulls you in close this moment of warmth and relief that washes over both of you and being reunited here in this chamber the two servants sit in the back awkwardly not quite understanding entirely either and whispering to each other while marion continues to hold you and rock you back and forth my beautiful jester i have missed you so much i remember you telling me you telling me you were going to go there how was it i have not traveled beyond the boundaries i'd be happy to she traces her fingers down your face she feels it can i see my little girl they're fine you drop the illusion and even though she knew it wasn't until she gets an opportunity to look upon your face and your hair and your eyes and your smile that you watch life breathe in like a renewed fire into the chest of your mother immediately she grabs the sides of your cheeks and pulls you in i've missed you so much brings you in and kisses you on the forehead and starts running her fingers through your hair he is very adorable she immediately starts brushing your hair with her fingers on the side you've gone so far and traveled so much you have to tell me about what you've done yes it is please do not mind she knows what to do now in front of the mirror with you behind her she's looking at you through the mirror over her shoulder as you're helping lace up the back of her bodice she's enthralled listening to all this i would never have thought my little jester would be seeing the world and fighting creatures i want to see how strong you've gotten perhaps wait until after the performance i've just applied my-- anyway at that point she stands up and nadine helps her put the rest of her dress on it's this beautiful deep purple satin-type material it's low-cut with this beautiful long training sleeve that hangs down past her knees when her arms are at her side puts on her necklace a faint velvet choker that pulls across the back of the neck there and in the center is a small blue gem that she keeps to remind herself of you she takes a moment to look in the mirror well how do i look then perhaps you should go join your friends perhaps you can technically spend higher spell slots to cast a lower level spell if you want to it's up to you okay okay you run back downstairs join the rest all right in the 15 or 20 minutes or so that jester's been gone the rest of the room has filled to the point where there are a few people hovering around your tables in hopes that perhaps you will leave and they will try to snipe it from you occasionally clear their throat in your presence hoping that maybe you'll recognize their status as higher they eventually make their way to the opposite side of the room perpetually throwing stink-eye in your direction you guys i believe took a table near the stairs which would be on the right side probably for a table that was available looking from the entrance you came so it would be on the northeastern side of the building it's ten tables yeah throughout the interior of this whole chamber you probably have now including yourselves close to 50 to 60 people that includes the people who are standing because the tables have either been taken some of the tables here are set in reserve for people that are only two folks that sit there and no one else is allowed to take the table and it is enforced they come with their own zolezzo bodyguards yeah there is a couple that is currently situated on one of the central tables the first one you see is a human woman probably in her early twenties or so very vibrant blonde hair that is pulled back and left into these curls that spiral down off the shoulders wearing a low-shoulder dress that's made of a very fine-- you can't really make out the material but it has a sheen to it beautiful jewelry across the way you can see a much older man receding hairline a bit deep grayish turning white hair very deep set crows feet in the sides of his face where his eyes are almost not visible the eyelids themselves seem to be almost drooping and the wrinkles beneath are encroaching upon what little of the eyes you can see probably in his seventies or so very well dressed with a coat and tails both their attire seems to be more dwendalian than menagerie coast at least in the styles that they are wearing though they do have two zolezzo that are hired and keeping a watch at the table you do not drinks have been ordered to your specifications of the table and the drinks here are expensive okay it's rare that you get rounds here you either get high end liquors or bottles of wine all right that will cost you approximately-- almost six gold for two bottles of wine actually no i'm sorry i read that wrong for the liquor it would be six gold for the two bottles of wine it's ten gold apiece so 26 gold total i don't know do you tip here the doors are closed on the other side of the chamber the band brings their song to a close a bit of a murmur takes the quiet room as the lights shift the candles that were all that warm yellowish orange light suddenly all at once reduce to a low red flicker and that's where we're going to take a break (shouting) we'll come back here in just a few

minute 60 seconds from being able to get it so look for it asap the proper way to celebrate all right as you've all been sitting in your seats enjoying your small table snacks the chamber has closed the lights have shifted and there is a bit of anticipation and tension in the room as the musicians begin to slowly build up to a new type of song that begins to fill the space you hear the gentle footfall down the stairs curving down from the right hand side to the central staircase the beautiful visage of the ruby of the sea in her dark dress the train dangling up about six or seven steps behind her as her fingers trace the sides of the railing she comes down takes a breath and begins to gently sing to the audience around you and you watch as everyone in the room begins to lean forward entranced the beautiful voice filling the interior of this inn the lights seem to almost flicker and shift with her emotional intent of the song as her voice fills the space with warmth the light seems to brighten ever so gently with each crescendo even the bartenders themselves have stopped though they've seen performances like this hundreds of times it's still a performance that draws attention from all across the coast and beyond jester you've seen this many times as well but it doesn't ever lose its luster you see as all the tables themselves are quiet as she steps into the center of the room walking from table to table tracing the edges with her fingers making eye contact with each of the patrons you see that older man and the younger woman sitting at the table both sit comfortably watching but can't help but smile in the presence of this fantastic vocalist you see at another table there is a rather burly looking man who is well dressed though a bit rugged for what he's wearing who is flanked by two dwarven bodyguards and he's leaning in real intent on the table towards her and as she steps by he touches her hand and she touches it and pulls away a bit and gives him a wink and continues singing he pulls back into his chair resting you watch as one of the other tables has these three merchants that have been there since the moment you arrived who seem to be eagerly counting out coins and pushing them to the edge of the table to tip her as she passes by she glances off to one of the assistants who rushes over and scoops them off the table she does not accept the tips herself nevertheless for those of you who this is your first time here within the lavish chateau this is definitely one of the most beautiful performance you've seen and you immediately see why jester's mother why the ruby of the sea or at least one of the many reasons that she's renowned across these lands as she completes the piece she ascends back up the stairs back to her chambers vanishing from sight as everyone within stands up and begins clapping and cheering with that the doors open to the backside of the inn some folks begin to saunter out their performance that they've come to see for the evening complete others go back to their meal and their drinks and their conversation some individuals begin to approach the bartenders and eagerly ask for what you know to be the availability for companionship that the ruby has for the evening you watch as the lights flicker and shift in a similar way that they did with the performance some of the patrons stop and look towards the stairs to see if she's coming back down again and then (sigh) the heavy footfalls catch your ear as this stomping sound start making their way down the stairs you watch as a male figure comes down in a huff one of the men that you saw watching the performance earlier the more muscular fellow getting a better look at him now you can see he has a rough tangled like a bowl cut that is a bit unkempt at the shoulders a very wide neck and once again he's well dressed but his sun-weathered skin and lack of social grace and his physicality belies this weird space between how he holds himself and how he dresses nevertheless he storms down the stairs his two dwarven bodyguards leaving along with him they end up exiting the inn as nadine opens the room actually your mother-- and opens the door and your mom who has taken the dress off and has currently put on a comfortable robe turns and goes jester i have taken no suitors this evening so we can spend it together you've said you wanted me to meet your friends i want to hear their stories and i need to say thank you to those who've kept my little girl safe of course of course well you are welcome to stay in your room if you like i can definitely have rooms arranged for all of you if you would prefer whatever you prefer my dear okay you guys head all upstairs and eventually make your way to the third landing and the chamber's open and there nadine's waiting and escorts you in beautiful chambers with a large canopy bed you can see silks in the windows that have elements of gems and beads knitted into these braided cords that you can imagine during the daylight would add bits of colored speckles throughout the chamber you see a balcony that overlooks the entirety of the wharf below and also know this to be the balcony where jester got in trouble but there you can see within this-- exactly i'm very confused by that exchange but chairs are being brought up more food is being brought up behind you two more bottles of wine have been fetched to your chamber and there robe placed on most of the jewelry removed but still fully made up and smiling as you enter you see the beautiful red-skinned ruby of the sea her dark hair now tied up behind and resting down the back of her robe with a single curl that runs in front of the face on the right side faintly white yellow gold eyes the horns that curl backwards and then shift off to the sides abruptly before curving back a little bit it's this beautiful curl that extenuates the way her hair falls behind it gives this wreath and a crowned look to her this regal presentation even when she's just wearing comfortable robes as you all enter one by one she goes please know that you are guests of me here within this call this your home for as long as you'd like to stay well you would have to eventually pay but you are welcome to stay for a while under my name please i would like to the know the names if you would like to introduce i can see that well i can see where she speaks honestly in front of her mother as well she puts her hand out she pulls away but rests just a moment on your finger tips before pulling away and smiles i can see you are a very strong-willed and protective man do you watch over jester in my stead good i feel better knowing that she's safe in your care anyway right you mentioned that earlier beau it is a pleasure she reaches and shakes your hand the pleasure is mine as well thank you and thank you you i can sense a bit rough in the social graces so i am very honored that you would come to see my performance is that a zemnian accent it shows that you've traveled some distance to be here i appreciate that well you've found plenty of it here so perhaps the fish has found a home well i was not aware this was the dress of a detective yes you are takes a step back oh don't apologize the world is made of all kinds they are the rats of the city i have had plenty but i thank you well i think you are very adorable it is a pleasure to meet you nott she grabs the edges of her robe and counter-curtsies halfway while she's sitting in her chair and this one this-- interesting the pleasure is mine you've not been outside of this graveyard that my daughter speaks of a man fresh to the world of vice i presume oh my daughter will break you of any habits of ignorance very quickly good you carry very interesting companions i did not that is incredible well i am grateful that you all have kept her safe i'm excited to hear that you've been able to do such incredible things is this your friend that you mentioned before the traveler no but the healing wow oh very well well that is incredible well i-- here let's have some drinks the servants begin to uncork the wine and-- to be honest that one she points to one of the two bottles that were brought up as opposed to the smooth wine bottle this has a faceted gem-type crystal design to it the cork itself has a deep crimson ribbon that's tied around it there's a little wax seal placed upon it it's a cantrip (laughter) i can't wait to perform them for you not with me he knows better than to go after a well-connected and mostly innocent figure i have been working to try and get those charges eliminated but it is a difficult process he is a man who-- his pride is very important to him so in time but for now perhaps just do more of what you've been doing to not look like yourself once you leave this space (laughs) i mean yes but i would not insinuate such a dark thing well what has brought you here i mean i'm happy to have you but if you are just here to see me perform then i-- right not directly but i may be able to ask around i would perhaps-- she hands it back to you unfortunately no i have not come across an evantica there are many captains here in the port i apologize but i know many i don't know an ionos either you do recall that ionos is a member of the jagentoth family up in shadycreek run marisha and yeah that was the connection with who that letter was intended towards but continue to ask this is a vibrant city and there are many people that come and go perhaps you could find somebody to help you out there i will continue to ask around i'm being careful with my socialization these days well it's no trouble i just-- i've been having some problems with a client it's fine he's a very intense man who relocated here from fionen about two months ago a burly fellow named algar dyomin yes kind of strange interesting taste in presentation that is him yes he is very-- dyomin d-y-o-m-i-n (sighs) he's become very possessive he has been a client of mine a number of times and while his conversation was on the duller scale of individuals i've been with he paid well and did not seem to bring a problem but he has become more and more possessive and only in this past week i've been hearing of him threatening and telling other clients of mine to back away i do not enjoy people threatening my clientele or my business i have twice now explained to him precisely the nature of our arrangement and relationship that does not seem to be enough for him now the zolezzo of the chateau are my guardians and they're very good about keeping watch i have my friends in the archways but the more i look into it i believe algar works directly for the concord within the city so he is with his own powerful allies as well this is my first time dealing with scenarios like this but i'd prefer to avoid any sort of direct confrontation by any means necessary any bloodshed within the chateau (sighs) (laughs) i appreciate your cleverness little nott however rumors travel quickly for some of them perhaps he has not broken the law his friends in some places enforce the law that is where my conundrum lies honestly i'm not certain what kind of work he does though he often brags about his importance as men are wont to do he does seem rather wealthy and he bears enough respect perhaps the wharfmaster may know more that would be helpful though i don't mean to brag but good luck be careful how you dance around that very much the old woman of the lighthouse has been here for some time could ask her perhaps yes yes the keeper of it the lightkeeper gladys i think no they only meet here it needs to be on my terms it needs to be in my realm of safety no he's also been braggadocious but not forthcoming with personal information either which is unfortunately a sign of perhaps dubious and/or dangerous business he's told me twice he wishes to one day show me his secret his great servant beneath the city but-- i don't believe he's done anything that would warrant anything too disastrous but if he can be ensured that his presence is not welcome and agrees that is the case that would be optimal there are many there is the skew which is where most of the riffraff and common folk live but if you're looking for more social environs all across the restless wharf there is the open quay those two places a lot of curious folk wander and celebrate fisticuff it is not uncommon to find bodies in alleys dyomin algar a-l-g-a-r please i do not mean to impose my responsib-- of course i'm sorry it took a little longer than anticipated as far as i know there is but one person there i have not met them directly only heard of them gladys she is a bit older in human years so be respectful i guess i don't know i don't know what her interests are but perhaps if you could find out or at least not make her extremely angry i do not require compensation but if it makes you feel better about it certainly you're quite the gentleman yes i know of him well i know of a man of you describe of blueish skin and quite sweaty yes he has come through before he was very nice he was very dashing i told you about him before sam and i don't know of the name 'the gentleman' but-- tell me more of this gentleman please well dressed smooth voice little patch of dark hair on the chest right there that's a very different place yes the evening nip is the name of that one i don't know about anything in that regard but he wasn't named the gentleman when i met him she smirks a bit and says oh honey we had a bit of a romance years ago i told you about babenon sam marisha and babenon dosal b-a-b b-a-b-e-n-o-n bob loblaw's law blog you say he's in zadash now that's what he told me marion seems both present and not she's trying to process all of this she reaches over and goes to her counter and begins drawing she's not anywhere as good an artist as her daughter well yeah if you're going to draw a picture i'm going to draw one real fast too not at this speed i'm not no i'm not she's not a good artist either so she's like-- you can make a connection i am so confused by this but you've talked to him you've seen him you know where he is i can't leave okay what do you say okay so the spell sends no response it's late evening it's probably close to midnight by now oh my god of course it does there is a palpable pause of nothing and then he responds no that's preposterous maybe it is i know a lot of people use the word 'preposterous' it's a fairly standard word i'm sorry maybe i just got a bit excited my apologies said he had to leave and take care of some business on the sea i never saw him again you're not wrong but though he may be gone he left me with the greatest gift i've ever had so-- she runs her hands through your hair once more for that i'm thankful love is a funny thing there's still a part of my heart that will always be his but it's been decades you move on that could mean literally two decades regardless you can see she's flushed in her face i will have rooms arranged i will send the servants to get it taken care of you will have the finest suites at the inn for the better part of this week and longer if need be just let me know you can see she's a bit shaken by everything but trying to put on the facade that she's good anyway it is a pleasure thank you for the companionship for the words for the stories and for bringing me my little sapphire i should probably sleep good night thank you thank you if you need anything-- to be shown taught-- i have friends who can help you well-- i don't really go out to the bookstores i have books brought to me but you may look around there are a handful i'm certain good night and she pours her glass full holds it and sleep well and she kisses you on the forehead good night jester closes the door i don't think she seems okay well that'd be more of a question for her your rooms are arranged for you they're pillow trove-level presentation the interior is warm and the beds are ostentatious yeah from what you guys are used to sleeping in you almost don't know what to do with it once you lie in bed it's almost too comfortable roughly yeah queen to king you all managed to find yourself some rest for the evening some more tense than others some setting up invisible threads the morning comes with the light of the sunrise you open your windows and look out over the ocean and the city below you can smell the salty air the marine layer has brought in a familiar gray sky to those of you who grew up to the more northern regions of wildemount you can still hear the distant calls and caws of the flying seagulls and ocean birds you can see some of the higher buildings and towers with their little perched clusters you watch as a few dive down into the merchant districts of the city and some distant echoing yells as they shoot back up with a caught fish that was supposed to be sold the ships are already out and starting their day you can see maybe 20 or so that are out in the main harbor and scattering further to find their specific areas to begin throwing their nets into the water the morning is yours actually the palace-like center here-- the marquis is the head of the local chapter of the concord that looks over nicodranas the concord itself is a loose union between all the cities in the menagerie coast there's a margrave in each city that is the head of the city but then works with the other margraves to interface and make sure everything's good bad and business is well that would be the center of concord influence here okay heading to the wharfmaster is fjord and beau all right steven so you-- okay doesn't work the two of you make your way back to the restless wharf you're searching for the wharfmaster specifically make an investigation check and since beau's helping you you can do advantage on that one okay beau have you retrieved the professor or have you left it with the inn okay you spend the better part of two hours or so wandering up and down the wharf asking questions before you eventually have somebody point you over if you looking for the wharfmaster he's at the wharf load right there and points over one of the larger center parts of the dock that jettisons out into the harbor a good hundred or so feet there is a central dock house that is one of the buildings you saw when you first entered where you saw a lot of the business was bustling around although it is not as busy as it was at dusk when you first entered the city but as you approach the building you open the front door and someone is pushing past you there are a handful of zolezzo looking around but it looks like entering the wharf load isn't a notably guarded experience so as you enter there is one zolezzo across the way that is sitting in a chair and looking out and chewing on some sort of rough tobacco-like leaf in their jaw across the way you can see a couple of folks-- humans-- in the process of filing out big leather books ledgers and receipt books of various people traveling through and you see in the back over a table with a bunch of papers rolled out either charting maps or large assembled lists of previous excursions you see a male dwarf probably middle to older age red hair that tends to eventually expire into a deep gray at the end of this really curly matted beard you see big gold thick earrings that hoop from each earlobe-- the weight of this heavy thick lobe has dragged the ears to stretch a bit past the face the hairline comes in a deep widow's peak that recedes almost back to the top of the head before coming in and there you can see in a similar tangled tuft the rest of his hair that coasts past his shoulders before it exerts into a strange puff he is wearing a simple leather tunic over a work uniform but three or four fairly expensive necklaces or amulets that clatter around as he moves you get the sense of his placement by the other individuals going up and asking him questions he's probably the wharfmaster he looks busy and there is a counter that prevents you from traveling in without going around it as you begin to make your way around the counter one of the individuals up there puts his hand out whoa whoa whoa can i help you i'll see what i can do he takes the coins and pockets them and walks behind and begins whispering the dwarf puts his hand up for a second and finishes making a couple measurements and then huh all right he jumps off his small stool and comes over with heavy footsteps across the wooden creaking floor now extending over the wharf he approaches the edge of the counter across from you and goes right so you've summoned me to you what can i do to help you make a deception check did you have advantage on that what was your first roll i don't know just double checking he looks at you and goes hold on a second you see his gears turning and he goes through a couple books unfortunately by the records records we have here vandren and his ship was lost at sea months ago i apologize yes he comes and goes rather commonly yes i honestly don't know where he lives but i know where he works all right he works in the sluice weave the sluice weave s-l-u-i-c-e sluice weave sloose sweef there you go if you are looking to sell you are welcome to go to either meandering treasures here in the restless wharf they tend to pay maybe not top change but quickly as far as dezima does his business usually dezima he is the proprietor of the meandering treasures we have-- and he looks back to one of his sheets of paper and pulls it out for a second and looks at it we currently have eight dock spaces not spoken for that are available for rent if that is your interest depending on the size of the vessel of course no we've just had a lot of ships leave recently there is a lot of movement in and out make a persuasion check he's like i've seen him around he's a dubious sort of prick fuck if i know to be honest he takes up space he's done some work at the docks here and there but he rubs me the wrong way probably find him drinking at any of the dives if not drowned already there were some strange cats that came in last night off the docks yes he starts giving you a curious look you're asking a lot of questions for a person i've just met of course let me give you a very prestigious piece of advice i think that will help you in your business dealings here don't ask so many questions good day then he turns back and clomps back over to his table and is working but keeps looking up expectantly waiting for you to leave and kind of like-- so what are you guys doing at this point in time i'd say it's probably a little past noon since the morning okay so you guys heading there to meet with the rest of the crew right the rest of you folks you you walk over to the door it is a standard thick dark wooden door with a small slot to look through that is currently closed you wait about a minute and there's no response the louder one seems to echo a bit and after another minute or so of waiting you hear this faint creaking sound it gets louder and louder until eventually the small door opens and you see this really shriveled woman's face these beady little dark eyes peeking through and goes can i help you i am make a persuasion check with advantage she peeks in and looks at you and may the grace of melora bring us to talk and it closes and you hear (locks clicking) it creaks open and for as high as the slip was the woman's head's about two feet lower than where it was there's a stepping stool that's attached to the back of the door as it opens up slightly and she escorts you in slightly and the woman you see-- if you can imagine a more burly after working physically every day estelle getty a little wider she has no sleeves on this long working dress and leather apron or uniform that she wears her arms while the skin itself is sagging and wrinkled there are some guns on this old woman her hair is a tuft of tightly curled white hair no glasses just the beady little dark eyes where she smiles the wrinkles cause this butterfly effect across the rest of her face human yes so you invoked the mother i assume you are also a follower of hers i cannot say that i have my apologies well i'm happy that she could be a beacon to you as she's been to so many who have passed through nicodranas perhaps her guidance is going to be very useful to you in seeking out a way to cleanse this temple you speak of i cannot guarantee entry to the top at least-- and peeks around behind to the rest of you sam and hello no i don't know if i can be of much help to you i am but a simple mistress of the tower but-- i can tell you of its history come in sure yep kept trying to find the right audio file and now this kept coming up real busy it's a really busy wharf guys anyway fuck me for trying to add atmosphere right i know it's all good as she lets you all in with a bit of a grimace she goes all right this is the lighthouse it is of the mother melora looks over those ships at sea keeps them safe probably but the lighthouse mainly helps the sea more or less i have been here for the entirety of my life for now 86 years in nicodranas yes that's how i've gotten to this age and still as spry as ever starts walking up the first set of stairs come you should see the view every time you do it just adds more hit points (laughter) so here in this tower the lady looks over us those who wish to have her guidance to prevent dangerous storms at sea or the draw of the tide to bring them to the depths are wise to leave for her some gift before they traverse on their journey you will see here is the viewing window 'tis not for sleeping and it is not the mother's boob you glance up and you can see now there is a window that's set right about where the clavicle is it's a beautiful view of the entire harbor especially this time of day when the sun's at its peak you see this beautiful set of ships out there and fishing vessels and galleons and a handful of different designs to each different make from all over the world there's one that appears to be of marquesian make you can even see through the very clear ocean waters here you can see shapes far below the waves from this view as well you can see elements of a reef in the distance you can see a few broken and long silt-covered remnants of ships that had sunk in this harbor from long ago it's breathtaking in a way you weren't expecting you can keep gawking if that is your preference but the lighthouse is up top follow me to the top floor you have the view of everything around you not just that front view of the harbor but this beautiful image of the ocean and the shoreline and the fields and rolling hills that surround nicodranas of the cyrios mountains to the north and then far to the east you can see the jungles that then vanish up the sides of the ashkeeper peaks it's a tremendous view and then the entire city below it's once again increasingly breathtaking from the one you previously had this is my home damn right you should keep up do more cardio no not really kind of prickly laura and no seriously if your friend with the pink hair wasn't here i wasn't going to let you in now that you've focused on this there are no windows to the lighthouse there's a metal structure that holds up the top this faint 15-by-15 foot dome that marks the ceiling of it each of these openings between these metal rods that holds that up are where the light protrudes you can see now the marine layer starting to burn away in the midday and most of the fog is receded towards the horizon the blue sky having returned-- you see this rough-cut quartz-like crystal that's about three and a half four feet in diameter that's set in the center of this top floor it is my responsibility to invoke the mother's blessing of the stone and each day have its light guide the ships back to safe shore i can sense even looking upon you i can smell decay that is very astute of you it was at a time when their temperaments were less in conflict they two the union blessed upon this shore the gifts of stone that then built this tower well i can maybe help with one and probably laugh at the other so choose carefully cute i've seen this man around in the streets below no i don't really talk to people i look at them below she points over to the edge and there's actually a spyglass leaning against the edge she goes i see a lot that goes on in this city no but i know there are things beneath it there are a couple of places i believe i do not know where he lives make a persuasion check with disadvantage as you instinctually reach for the spyglass she slaps your hand no because it is my eye in the sky not yours insolent child depending when he disappears to do most of his work beneath in the sluice-- something there are two submerged gates in the harbor the sluice weave yes not that you'd know that technically it's fine it's all good i know you're done caleb is murdered no metagaming seagull (laughter) (sighs) the harbor has protectors and has for many generations that exist beneath the waters in this city that is part of how the sluice functions i believe this algar person you mentioned works in some sort of managerial position there probably need some sort of a small boat or something but if you're going to go there and you don't have approval you'll probably be arrested are you a goblin yes and you're working with these people she's pretty hideous look it's okay it is something we have in common what do you think i've lived alone here my whole live because i'm a spinster (scoffs) it's okay i think i could too please they're beginning to grate on me (laughs) (sniffs) what is this this is a very kind gesture very thoughtful you as well all right now get out sets it down on a little side table and quickly pushes you back towards the stairs yeah above you what are you trying to do make a stealth check you got to do that beforehand as you're heading down the stairs you jump off to the side in that small alcove where the window is and then a second one of you appears she begins to walk past you then stops and turns right and looks right at you and goes are you going to join your friend of you (laughter) good go as she pushes you all she's not answering any more questions she's like out out out out you both of you her hands pass through your duplicitous image she goes that's strange okay out thank you for the tea goodbye goodbye goodbye (door slamming) (locks clicking) beauregard what's your passive perception 13 oh they're down here actually okay good to know all right you guys eventually meet up you guys have been outside probably about three hours or so total of travel and asking and getting questions i'd say two and a half yeah you guys eventually gather in the center of the open quay this is the western side of the docks on the city whereas the restless wharf seems to be a really busy dockyard that runs a very tight ship and seems to be filled with elements of cheap entertainment and in that vein the open quay it's a little a little bit smaller it seems to be less organized but in the center of it is this one massive tower that looms over the entire district of this side of the docks it's an emerald stone-- dark green with elements of light green flecked through it-- spire that seems very out of place amongst the rest of the storage buildings and the various other small homesteads and businesses that fill this entire area it seems to be dotted with a number of small balconies and comes to a slight roofed peak that is like a sharpened point it's very out of place here you've passed by it a couple times before but you haven't really inquired much about it as most of your business here had been on the job so you've not really cared to ask or question sure you grab an older fisherman thinning hair very sun-weathered face is carrying a small sack over his shoulder various supplies and coiled rope over the other shoulder as he's heading off towards the docks stops and turns can i help you that's tide peak that's the tower of yussa errennis the mage who owns this district yes to the chagrin of the clovis concord yes you could say that i need to get to work yussa y-u-s-s-a errenis e-r-r-e-n-i-s there are zolezzo around the area they're still keeping the peace here but there are no zolezzo guarding the tower yeah a few hundred feet i would say from the tower yeah okay you approach it the district distinctly around this tower the road is very wide surrounding it no buildings are buttressed against it it seems to be solitary amongst the rest of the constructed buildings here the folks that are walking in the streets nearby tend to walk on the opposite side of the road nope it's just ground it's built in the center of this district and everything's either built or shaped around it make an investigation check you get up to the tower and begin to inspect its build all the stones here look freshly cut not a lot of wear and tear weathering to them it's hard to tell how long it's been here it seems like it could've been installed last week or 25 30 years ago about ten feet before you began to really make that assessment you go and touch it it's cold stone not yet yeah it's a tower spire but the base of it is probably somewhere between 80 to 100 feet in diameter okay you guys run around meet on the other side no entrance no windows there are the balconies but the first balcony is maybe 25 feet up yeah they're sporadically cast around it at its peak it's probably about 450 feet tall yeah it's this long spire no and to help the visual thing i said 100 feet wide diameter that's a bit wide for what i was originally thinking it's about maybe 60 feet that's your estimation from this fore point make an acrobatics check you have advantage because he's helping you you run leap fjord catches your foot and gives you the meager not very strong lift but something to help your first foot hits the wall the second one hits and you get a moment of traction before you (slipping) you only get maybe 12 13 feet off the ground before you (impact) fjord steps back and you (whack) thankfully you have slow fall as a monk ability you would take six points of bludgeoning damage from the fall yeah monks can fall from very high and three-point landing and be fine you still hit your tailbone and it still stings a little but you don't take any damage you guys round the corner and you watch beau suddenly slam into the ground near the central tower you don't really know well the quay is the district you're in the district right now yeah it's a heavily residential district for the more affordable and cheaper residents no the meandering treasurer is a shop make an investigation check if you're looking around the open quay there are a few people that point you towards the withered bird inn which is an inn and tavern and you've probably passed by it before once the direction is pointed out you're like yeah no i've been there it's a little dive-y but it's popular amongst the sailors and folks that come through if you're looking for something in the restless wharf the only place that really comes to your attention that's told is the wayfarer's cove more birds must die it's maybe 30 minutes away you make your way out of the open quay towards the restless wharf district once more fjord you keep looking over your shoulder your interest towards the tide peak tower it's interesting the further away from it you get the shorter it looks and you begin to understand how you didn't notice a 400-foot tower when you first entered the city or one you've been around before and you've been to this city before it seems the further away you walk the tower seems to visually shrink within the city skyline it's still visible as a tower and it's still taller than most of the buildings but as soon as you guys get quite a ways away you're like that can't be more than maybe 150 feet tall no it vanishes and then you hear (poof) and you look over your shoulder one of the small tables on the side of one of the various warehouses that contained a bucket that had a bunch of tools and various repair materials for ships has been knocked over and the puppy's tumbling out of it runs up to you and jumps back into your arms that's basically what he is puppies are useless at this age man finishing the rest of your jaunt here as fjord is making equations in the air in front of him you eventually make your way by asking a few more questions towards the wayfarer's cove as you approach this dark looking dive that is probably furthest of all the other bars or taverns you've seen here out towards the docks itself the super dark wood that it's constructed of makes it look almost like a blighted barnacle on the rest of this wharf area as you approach the exterior you can see a large piece of driftwood that probably belonged to a ship long before that had either fallen in the ocean or after its final voyage was pulled apart and then elements of it were used to either build or embellish on the structure it looks like the kind of bar that was salvaged or was built from salvage as you step through the entry way the door's open slightly ajar you pull it open the interior has no music there is just whispers and conversation the smell hits you immediately the smell is a combination of mossy musk from wood that has been soaked with seawater and then left to dry hundreds of times over as well as the various forms of liquor and ale that have been spilled and left to stain the wood where it lies and a lot unwashed sailor scent yeah the odor in here is not pleasant definitely that of the working man or woman who comes in from the sea glancing inside there is a bar to the immediate left where there is a rather crotchety looking fellow half-elf who is heavily scarred on one side of his face a bit heavy set for a half-elf for the elven lineage it's rare to see someone who has not displayed the more lithe side of the blood line but this elf has either worked hard to fight that side of their bloodline and has a bit of a paunch and a bit of a soft chin and jawline he looks over to you and nods he goes let me know if you need a drink or something spits off to the side looking inside glancing about the small number of patrons here there's only five of them at the bar this time of day you see one really old salty looking sailor who has this heavy cap pulled down over his ears to the point where he has these bushy white eyebrows that poof underneath where the fold of it brims upward and has this big puffed chinstrap beard around the side his lips are pressed up to where you can tell he probably has no teeth so his jaw can press all the way up towards the roof of his mouth and he's sitting there with a large dark green bottle of some sort of beer or ale and is just staring forward chewing quietly off to the right hand side you see for some of you the first time what looks to be a very very large humanoid turtle you see them sitting on a bench you've seen a few tortles in your travels but they don't normally travel northward into the empire this one is sitting there hunched over a table by themself with a heavy tankard that they're clutching with both of their hands you see bits of rope that are tied across in a lattice over elements of the shell and on the right side of the shell you see emerging three pipes or horns of some kind that are either carved or embedded on the right side of the shell it looks like three exhaust pipes if you will but they're made from some sort of ivory-type material they look chipped a little bit and worn as it turns back its extended head and a snapjaw type nose curves back and you see an eye patch over the right eye and just grins you see these series of tattoos up each arm that look like swirling water that curl into themselves and end right at the forearm it goes back to its drink and sips a bit from it you see another patron in the far back is a woman with weathered dark-brown skin the hair itself is this tattered wild mass of curled and crimped hair that's graying heavily towards the tips she has a long light brown coat made of leather-like material that probably hangs down to the floor from where she's sitting and where her calf-high boots are visible from under the side she's sitting across from somebody who's dressed as a ready-to-action shipmate they have a basic billowing shirt that is opened down to the mid chest they have a ruddier complexion probably sunburned over and over again to the point where now it just looks like they're perpetually sunburned he looks younger probably in his 20s the woman looks maybe in her mid to late 40s or so both human and they both glance over as you enter the dark interior contrasted by the very bright light that silhouettes your figures as you step within the wayfarer's cove and that's where we're going to pick up next week it's a weird place she had dark kind of caught crazy hair that-- it goes gray about halfway down and goes to a gray-white at the tips it's this mane of hair we'll pick up in the next week in the meantime we missed you guys happy to be back in the game even one week
