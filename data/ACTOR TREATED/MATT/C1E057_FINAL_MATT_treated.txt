welcome to tonight's episode of critical role where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors battle traffic from e3 to get here in time to roll dice and play dungeons and dragons thank you for being patient and waiting for us with a couple of tech issues and generally battling living in los angeles and having a car anyway before we kick the night off real fast i just want to take a moment to acknowledge-- and i feel it's important to acknowledge there's been a lot of difficulty and a lot of terrible things happening in the world and in our country in particular this past week or so and us as critical role and this community around i'm sure many of you agree we just wanted to take a moment to express that we stand with the families of those that are currently dealing with this difficulty who have lost those and stand with the community that this was aimed at and everybody who has come together as part of this we are in full support of this whole wonderful gathering of people in light of this darkness and i think it's not just myself when i say that everything this community stands for is to perpetually spread love community positivity acceptance and everything in between so we just wanted to bring that to you guys and let you know that we're thinking about you all out there and we have a wonderful community of critters out there as well if anyone needs any help assistance or guidance or even just a happy word to pick them up during this rough time we're all there for you so anyway (blows kiss sighs) then to kick off this evening of announcements and

rest of tonight's story (southern drawl) all righty let's go ahead and bring it down as we all prepare ourselves to begin to kick off tonight's episode of critical role (spooky ethereal music) (heavy breathing) (roaring) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (crackling flames) (laughs) grog had spoken with the remnants of the herd of storms that had essentially been disbanding from the name and moving west to join with the rivermaw which had stepped off from the herd not too long ago you guys had a hot springs episode in the mansion scanlan you had made your way back to kymal in which you along with the aid of a few of your friends figured out a plan in which the people who had been displaced could eventually return to westruun and also found kaylie and spoke with her had your somewhat-tearful reunion there you guys began to construct a subterranean portion of westruun that would be protected from future dragon incursion renovating and restructuring within the sewer system beneath the city after this process was complete you decided the next level of your trek the next direction you would travel would be towards the far western northwestern continent of othanzia specifically the city of vasselheim that you all know so well all of you guys stepping through a tree portal presented by keyleth you immediately step out into the snowy exterior of what seems like the outside of the quad roads in vasselheim and now we see what your next plan of action is what do you guys want to do it's hard to tell right now with the cloud cover so thick in the sky but you envision at this point in time it's probably mid-afternoon or so the general omniscient glow through the clouds kind of diffused light but based on the time that you-- where you were and how far you traveled you gather it's probably early to mid-afternoon so who's off to where it is quite a busy time in the afternoon there is actually a bit of hustle and bustle looking around just a quick glance at your vicinity in vasselheim you can see a lot of the bastions are out in force many of them are in process of helping construct what looks like reinforced dragon-headed ballistae some of the ones you had seen towards the outside walls of the city there are more being installed upon the inner walls and the ones in the distance appear to be under some form of construction all right you guys continue further south into the quad roads until eventually you find yourselves at the slayer's take guildhall the door is partially ajar already it appears that somebody had left it open but it is warm on the inside you can see a fireplace hearth on the far back and to the right is already kind of filling the area with this subtle musty smoke smell and the crackling of wood in the distance is a very welcoming sensation from the cold exterior of the city streets as you enter you do not see anybody at the front desk at the moment but you do see a few other random individuals of the guild that have taken certain tables some are eating and some are in the process of playing cards or passing the time it seems to be a relatively casual day here at the slayer's take but your rooms are still available best as you need anything you specifically require in this place okay you go ahead and-- one of the guys closest to you you've met him briefly in passing his name is loran he has a completely bald head with a single stripe tattoo down the center he has a very very pointed long chin human but he's probably been busted in the face a few times you can see there's just scars and what appears to be bone structure that may have been reformed at times due to blunt trauma but he's just sitting there sharpening his weapons just kind of doing good upon his own self being prepared for anything but as you come over to ask him the question he looks up to you and goes word's gone around the town recently that there's some wandering dragon horde tearing through tal'dorei so they're just upping security around these places just in case i hope so hope they make their way here not to my knowledge but (chuckles) i'd love to get my hand on some of them scales (blade scrapes) loran marisha and loran because that's what i remember well when you don't take notes when i give you a character's name originally and they come back around and it's weird when you suddenly take damage and your character starts hemorrhaging (laughs) some of you may have seen him in passing you haven't really had a conversation with him he just exists within the guild there's many members that you've come across in the past as far as this town is concerned it takes a lot more than a couple dragons to drop these walls it's the reason it's been around for a long time and i'd like to see them try i mean i've come across a few small ilk in my days oh that's fantastic i love to hear it you half-elves are a humble bunch (laughter) (laughs) (laughs) yeah a very different thing i guess it depends on if he shaved recently he looks toward the back room where her main office is and he goes you're welcome to go ahead and knock on the door if you're feeling frisky you go and knock on the door (knocks) there's a brief pause knock again (knocks) the door (whoosh) swings open you have to duck backwards it (thump) slams onto the other side of the wall there knocking a few knick-knacks that were on a nearby shelf over and vanessa swings out what who's calling-- ah it has been some time how nice of you to come and visit may i be of service to you there is no fencing we run a legitimate business good as was i hoping to hear this let me check my ledger she turns around and goes back to her desk her tail flicks behind her as she steps over to her table leans over (muttering) ah pulls one of the books (blows) starts thumbing through it (mutters) what color dragon chromatic there is currently no contract for a black dragon i do have one up for a bronze or perhaps a white but specifically hide if there is white dragonhide that was for a different contract this is for a newer one i came by (deadpan) yes it is amazing the things you've accomplished i am blown away but in light of your capabilities i do not require anything black dragon however if a contract comes in i know who to call hold onto that because that would save you a trip laura and is this hide or scales well i could definitely do a bit of business for you there the hide would fetch more but-- 60 pounds you said 64 of white dragon scales okay this is not about bartering this is what the contract says my dear this is beyond a situation of conversation the paperwork is already signed vex'ahlia my dear my delightful little dragon-hating half-elf we've been good to you we've done many great things for you you've done great things for us this is a fantastic arrangement (thud) she slams the book shut and sets it down but you have signed on with us and the deal is to fulfill contracts as they are signed as they are written as they are agreed upon by the person if you wish not to accept this contract we can just wait until somebody else picks it up and goes out and fulfills this need at the price at which they are requesting for this you're welcome to keep the scales see then it's easy for you to get rid of them if they've been a problem for you then i'm sure this would be easy that is all right goodbye and she shoos you out yes other female half-elf oh you're looking for the duskmeadow raven's crest she points loosely outward kind of southeast of the direction of the slayer's take guildhall it's kind of hard to miss it's giant black ominous (chuckles) you'll see it and she bops your nose a little bit with her finger now please out of my office i have work to get done that does nothing for me (slamming) slams the door shut (laughs) you pull out a basilisk egg it's roughly that size it's a dull grayish-blue hint it has a somewhat very vague sulfurous scent on the outside of the egg where are you heading that's the opposite direction you're heading to the braving grounds they're heading to the duskmeadow (laughs) so you three are going to the braving grounds you four are going to the duskmeadow okay all right so you three are making your way towards the braving grounds following suit after percival you make your way up not quite to the trial forge which is where you had your last discussion and brief showdown with earthbreaker groon still seeing the large statue of kord looming over the entirety of the realm you can still see the large columns of dark smoke and soot coming out of the various forges the various mining encampments and a lot of the folks there that are working on different pieces of iron and metal you i assume make your way to a very familiar abode (laughs) all right (laughter) you come up to the outside of a familiar hovel previously damaged missing part of its roof the roof is mostly repaired you actually see two individuals are over the top of it hammering pieces of wood into it not a very fine job but definitely enough patchwork to keep the rain and snow from pouring in the door is partially open as you approach silence (hammering noises) what i don't know i haven't seen him (mutters) (louder) couple of hours i haven't seen him leave (hammering noises) your funeral (hammering noises) you may make an investigation check 12 okay (creak) you move the door open and kind of search the ground and the area before it and the actual frame of the door itself no traps glancing inside though you can see a little bit of light it looks like there's a hooded lantern across the way and just a little bit of light is flickering and it's kind of going against the wall nearest to you to your right as you enter the same familiar smell of fresh earth really really really dry dust and a very familiar smell of explosive black powder material (thud) you see off to the side what you didn't initially notice as you entered what appears to be a wooden trapdoor in the far corner that (thud) (repeated thuds) and you notice that apparently something-- a large sack of some heavy material has rolled off a nearby table and is now currently holding the door down you hear a muffled i'm inside you lift it up set it off to the side (boosh) (coughing) what's going on you trying to kill me this is my mining building don't put things on top of the door it makes it hard to get out i'm okay no i've been locked down here for hours help me out (grunts) (grunts) i can't wait all day here (screams) don't shake me too hard sure thank you he pats you on the head with his nub goes over you can see he's kind of bandaged he goes over and then pulls the ladder up that he didn't use closes the-- okay so what do you want that's a lot i have powder i can sell you more powder question one yes how much not a lady i am an honorable man are you saying i'm pretty your friend's hitting on me i'm taken no i'm just taken (shouting) how much maybe maybe maybe a trade maybe a claw build and bring build and bring and we trade oh so many questions does he have questions too does he have questions too (sighs) i like him what's your question (considering noise) and he starts pulling around from a pile of oiled rags and shit and he pulls up what looks like a small burlap sack that's torn somewhat at the opening hat my pleasure happy to help (chuckles) don't get near the fire is that the one you're saying you can make so you're saying that this woman made a better hand than you can make then make me a better hand why would you give me a lesser hand really (laughter) (ripping sounds) he starts unwrapping the wound it's pretty recent fair he turns around rushes over and grabs the same phantom hogshead that he has lying around his place before he fills it with powder he goes over to scanlan and goes (hums) too big fills it with black powder carefully brings it over holding it under his arm (grunts) yes he pulls out the glove that was on the hand (laughing) and you can see that it's blown apart hand burned to cinders-- it's more a sleeve with a charcoaled edge depends how cool is the claw hand travis and cooler than that lady's hand (squawks) he takes the hogshead trade when you bring hand then i deliver with new hand then all is well no more questions you're small can't help you sorry okay don't touch the door please (chuckles) he’s big i'm undecided about you no no no there's basic materials to do essentially weapon repairs armor repairs minor armor construction within the slayer's take if you want something that's going to be a little more to the level of what you're doing you may have to actually rent out a facility okay yeah easy enough to do if you want to rent the forge for the day to craft whatever it is you're looking to craft he's charging you 50 gold for the day you have to supply your own material but he'll let you rent okay you guys you four make your way over towards the duskmeadow trinket's out (whoosh) (bear moans) (grunts) he rolls his head against you licks the side of your face happy to be out of that stuffy little necklace you make your way towards the duskmeadow which you've seen before it's a very comparatively glum-looking area of the town hence the name that accompanies it but this is the area of the city that contains the raven's crest the amaranthine oubliette it also contains the entire town's catacombs this is where since this town's existence all of the dead are interred perpetually deeper and deeper and deeper beneath this part of the city also one of the oldest libraries of the city is kept here as well as you approach the outskirts-- and you can see a very fine line between this area and the birth heart which is the melora section of the city there is a very very wide river divide between the two of them and it's like night and day back and back very very very directly between the two of them you can see on melora's side there's just stalks and stalks of corn and other vegetation that's being grown for food there's almost like a lush forest that curls around the outside of it that doesn't match the rest of the indigenous trees you've seen in this area of othanzia the entire birth heart area where this temple to melora is is just this plucked-out-of-nowhere section placed into it and then you move over to the duskmeadow and it's just like the color has left the vicinity and there you see in the center of this part of the town this large looming ominous obsidian and gold structure it's like a giant black stone aerie it has no intricacies from this distance that you can see it's almost like a giant square building that is just devoid of light with little glimmers of gold when the light catches it at moments it's hard to miss and definitely stands as a centerpiece to this section of vasselheim (moans snuffles) he presses his nose under yours and lifts your chin up and you bite your lip a little from the sudden impact from this very large bear but it's all with love you do know from your time here and what little you've heard that part of the purpose of this vicinity is not just to inter the dead within part of these catacombs the library here is kind of a loose partnership between the people worshipers of her and those who follow ioun it is a center for knowledge and history kept within the city but you'll see throughout the town and the landscaped outer wall that surrounds this entire portion of vasselheim there are repetitive glyphs that line this entire area and from what you've heard at the very least most of these glyphs which you see across the corners of roadways and many of which surround the entrance to the catacombs it is a perpetual enchantment that is to seal any sort of possible undeath there once was a terrible scourge of undeath in this part of the landscape long ago that corresponded with a battle hundreds of years ago and since then the reinforcement has been put in place to prevent that from happening again so the downside is that the power of these glyphs that prevent undeath also prevent any actual vegetation from existing in this area as well so all the ground that you've come across no grass no natural vegetation it's just dirt and ash and dust the magic itself is divine in nature but it's based in the same very very base draconic glyphs that a lot of arcane magic is based on it's very-- it's old magic yeah it's based in some sort of divine ritual the temple itself is referred to as raven's crest raven's crest yes okay which as you turn and look when you originally approached the stairs that lead up to the entrance of this large structure it was just empty doors closed there was no guard post on the outside it was just these two looming almost dark glass-type doors about 12 feet tall and about 8 feet wide on each side that are just locked shut as soon as you turn to walk towards them the doors open and you see a figure standing there at the door just looking directly at you or at least you assume is looking right at you it's hard to see this individual somewhat lithe in physicality is wearing long dark robes and their face is shrouded in opaque black cloth like a death shroud that just blocks the entire face you can see the hint of a jawline a nose it looks to be a person of some background in there but they're just standing there watching you and as soon as you react to their appearance the hand just beckons quietly all right as you step up to the stairs the figure leads you all inside and as you step into the main center of this initial walkway chamber the figure doesn't enter with you it just closes the door behind you (echoing thud) you can feel the hint of vibration of impact as the doors close shut it's lowly-lit on the inside and it's interesting from the outside it looks like a black solid impossible-to-see-through building from the inside you can actually look out and the entire building is made of this glass this somewhat-warped dark glass and you can see almost the entirety of the outside from your position the doors are held aloft into it it's like a one-way type enchantment or the construct the material itself is somewhat translucent from this side kind of or like a very very dark pair of sunglasses but made of naturally-formed rock almost she doesn't see you and she just stands there quietly looking around inspecting the vicinity pets trinket a little you just feel a natural tremble stepping into a place of powerful divine influence that is not the warm comfort of sarenrae which has protected you before now you understand the way many deities work in these lands and your place in it and sarenrae's place in it and you know enough about the raven queen to know that this is not an unwelcome place per se go ahead and roll a religion check 23 you understand the raven queen has also not always been the one who holds sway over the domain of death the domain of winter the domain of fate once mortal the raven queen ascended as essentially a follower and a partner to the previous god of death which his name has been erased from the books this mortal ascended many many years ago pre-second spark and has since taken what was once a tyrannical position of death and afterlife and souls and took it instead as the natural transition that it is however due to a lack of respect or at least a lack of for lack of a better term belief or trust from the other gods she only gained dominion over the actual moment of transition not of the actual souls of the afterlife that influence was given to others but the raven queen represents one of the most feared elements of life which is the end of it but you also know that that is a natural thing your personal belief is up to you the sense you get here is that being an individual that worships life that worships redemption that worships second chances you can't help but swallow a little hard at the idea of a god that's purpose is to make sure that if you're destined to have once chance it stays one chance as you begin to walk down this hall ever so slow as it is each footfall deafening in the clack (clicking footsteps) the hallway leads on for another hundred feet or so before the glass somewhat translucent material shifts into the next chamber into an almost deep gray and ivory ice-like interior the dark coal-black exterior you've seen now transitions into what feels like a very finely-carved piece of architecture from ice and bone go ahead and roll an arcana check as this is not so much a nature-based thing yeah from your understanding of transitional magic between planes there has been no actual shift between planes it's just the material itself is different upon the interior of this building as soon as you enter this place you do see another figure walking towards you similar long dark robes however the veil has been pulled back and you see before you what looks to be an older elven woman with very very bright silver hair that just kind of falls long past her shoulders down to her back about mid-waist or down to the bottom of her waist with a smile you can see as she walks towards you a very welcoming grin as she approaches she pays very little mind to you three but directly to you says you walk with her sight on you you are ever welcome here then i think perhaps you are here for communion come our most sacred chamber the communion pool awaits only you may have entry unfortunately come champion the lady of fates awaits and she turns around and leads you 30 more feet to what looks to be an ascending staircase that just enters up and out of the sight of you two you ascend a few feet behind her about 40 or so feet until it comes to a single large doorway of deep deep dark oak wood with what looks to be a dark iron ring in the center as she steps up to it she takes it and (thud) knocks on it twice (deep creak) it just shifts open and leads into a central chamber now that looks about a hundred feet high and it is a large steepled dome of what looks to be nothing but stained glass it's awe-inspiring it's beautiful the colors the light as it peeks through the source of light diffused as it is by the clouds is sourceless in here it seems like there are beams of light coming from all directions and all the colors are just strewn across the floor in what looks like this perpetually-shifting kaleidoscope of dots of reds and blues and purples and yellows and pinks and whites you can see across the room there are three other figures that are all dressed in the same dark robes the veils over their heads of varying size you can't make out what their racial background is per se but they are all stationed around the center of the room in which lies from what you can see a very very large round pool of some sort of deep crimson liquid you came to speak with the lady well the way is before you she gestures to the pool you step into it (squelch) it comes up to your ankles to your knees and what catches you first is that the liquid is very thick it is viscous in a familiar way this is most definitively a pool of blood and it is cold it is ice-cold as you step in you can feel that as it begins to seep into your boots and begins to find its way into the crevices of your outfit as you get down into your waist it's just chilling you can't help but to stand up straight as you step further in not quite sure of how deep it gets and it gets deeper and deeper up past your chest up past your shoulders and you're not even halfway into the center of the pool before it's going past your nose you take your last breath hold it and submerge yourself in the pool darkness around you the cold sensation nothing nothing nothing as you do you feel the blood fill your lungs and immediately your lungs begin to seize with the lack of oxygen you instinctually begin to reach up for the water and pull but you can't rise you can't get up and at that point the cold piercing pain of the liquid in your lungs becomes warm all the liquid around you becomes warm and in the darkness where you cannot see you calm as suddenly your breathing is no longer difficult it's natural it's like air and it's reminiscent of being in the womb of the moment of birth you'd forgotten so long ago that you're just surrounded in darkness and comfort and piercing the center of this darkness before you you see a very faint bead of white light just begin to spark and grow and grow and as that light widens out it becomes a face a porcelain face a nose lips a chin empty dark sockets long dark hair that goes to crimson and surrounds you you see a small hand reach up behind and lift you from your legs and for what you thought was only a few feet of liquid you look around you and it is an endless space a space you've been before a space that you once visited in your sleep in your dreams you look down below and you can see the infinite skein of threads that you were once given inspection to as you look down you see the very palm of the raven queen holding you aloft in this space as the mask pulls in close to you with a smile the lips don't move but you hear a voice from all directions in your head a comforting voice a welcoming voice my champion vax'ildan you've come to me at last there is destiny but you still guide your path where it must go especially you fate-touched you're one of the few that bends threads near and around you that's why you're so interesting to me when one such as your unique essence walks these realms do not think i am the only one to take interest and do not think you are the only one either but i was there to seize the opportunity when it arose and as such you are now mine and i know that you hate me i know that you fear me most do but only because they are without understanding without death life has no meaning finality drives change innovation greatness it is the end that i bring that drives all of your gracious creations of this land to make the world better than we did than those before me did then understand the wholeness of what it is you serve and what you represent champion even after death the soul is carried to another purpose but it is that transition where it is at its most vulnerable it is my charge my gift-- your gift now-- to safeguard that beautiful moment there are those that find the immortal soul one of the most pure and powerful means of energy of sourced power in this world that is an abomination there are those that wish to halt the process and live eternally in some form of undeath or the other that is an abomination there is also a difference between bending your thread around destiny fate-touched and perverting the thread entirely for death is sacred but not all deaths are destined in that moment some destinies require one to endure beyond the moment to meet that moment many times before the final death is to come we must guide these moments across this web and as she sweeps her hand out where she holds you in one palm another hand reaches out and the entire web of threads just glows below you in this curling wave out into infinity into the horizons endless to each side of you and beyond so to bend destiny to bend these fates is within our sphere of influence it's those that find a way to cheat this destiny halt the progression corrupt their thread to the point it sickens those around them undeath wayward necromancy perversion of the sanctity of the cycle of our very domain is an atrocity and must be stopped and stamped out that is our cause your cause now do you still accept this gift you vax'ildan i've had my eye on you for some time and the smile curls into this much wider smile to the point it seems somewhat perturbing your dual nature rushing prematurely towards your end wantonly throwing your life before the flames only to pull away in those last moments instinct you test your path constantly without knowing you've been preparing for this mantle your entire life my beautiful champion the smile subsides the face goes stone lack of expression blank the hand pulls back and you now can see the full immensity of her size her body infinitely long looking down before it disappears into darkness and as you look up suddenly the mask is there before you but normal human-sized you're no longer in her hand you're standing on a floor a floor of the same white ice-bone type substance that the interior of raven's crest seems to be built from and for a brief moment you see before you the woman before the god the ascended mortal no larger than you from the hair that topples down the sides the hand reaches up and grabs the mask and pulls it away beneath the mask you see a very beautiful very sad-looking woman but her eyes are cold and red in the iris her skin flawless and smooth white pale sunless her brows thinned and furrowed she steps forward and touches the side of your face there are those who will be frightened of you but know what we do is one of the most important gifts of all and she grabs your head pulls you down and kisses you on the forehead at which point suddenly your lungs fill once again with searing white pain you find yourself scrambling about instinctually spilling out liquid all around you and you finally (coughs) come out on top of the communion pool your eyes open and you can see just red crimson pouring in your vision you rub it out and you're in the chamber alone eyes wide swimming around you can see the figures on the side come to the edges they all bow the figure that led you in stands at the mouth of this pool where you entered she's smiling she has her hand extended she lifts you out of the pool one of the other figures runs up and takes one of the dark robes that they have and pulls it off around them revealing just a simple dark blue and black outfit beneath still wearing the veil but wraps the dark robe around you as the liquid is now back to its freezing cold sensation your teeth are chattering they lead you back to the door you entered down the stairs and into the central chamber where both keyleth and pike await you guys turn and see descending the stairs being flanked essentially by two of the members of the raven's crest both of the shoulders with the dark robe wrapped around a very cold and somewhat freaked-out looking vax'ildan who has smeared red across his face his hair is thick with viscous crimson liquid the woman who had led you in there smiles and says that is the nature of death we can't have all the answers my friend it is the pursuit of those answers that drives us do you trust her then perhaps you'll find those answers one day thank you they pull the robe off and they all head back up into the chamber leaving you all there in the room alone you guys make your way to the outside of raven's crest the doors open once again the figure that let you in is waiting for you opens the door as you see the doors open-- (laughs) rushing down the stairs you see pike keyleth and your brother in a little better spirits than when he first entered if a little damper and redder (sad moaning) trinket comes over and begrudgingly lowers himself so you can climb on (grunts) okay okay you guys eventually make your way back to the slayer's take the three of you guys what are you doing while this is transpiring okay what have they been sent to acquire all right how much gold do you give him that'll go over well i want you guys to go ahead and roll-- actually for you just roll a general charisma check to ask around and get people to give you the proper information you just add your charisma modifier 18 yeah just a basic clamp gauntlet not in the braving grounds but you can definitely find one on your journey in the quad roads do you go with him you guys make your way to the busy streets of the quadroads eventually asking around you find yourself across from what is called the sore socket haberdashery sore socket haberdashery and the picture outside has a caricature of a guy smiling with a giant black eye you walk inside and it's like a small localized bar-- not a tavern by any means but it has like one small set-up in there for just general beer and just loads and loads of hats leathers cloth all kinds of silly circumstances you see some nice fancy hats with big feather plumes you see joking hats that have multiple colors and what looks to be bells hanging from them as you step into the room you see two other random individuals that are looking around shopping and at the far end you see coming through a big thing of curtains what looks to be a rather rotund woman in her late 40s or so big curls in her dark brown hair and maybe a little too much makeup on her face who goes darlings what are you looking for what can i get you are you looking for hats i assume you're looking for hats after all those materials i'd say probably asking around and your high charisma you probably have about 60 my name is deidre dear so nice to meet you you're so adorable really oh ho i can guarantee you it's all true and you you're so big you're so strapping and that beard (giggles) tall proportionally tall or regular hmm she thinks for a second i don't carry anything like that-- but i can make you something if you don't mind waiting a bit oh but at least let me measure your head sweetie do you know the size of who it's intended for i'll make it adjustable you have to pay half in advance a custom order that will be 10 gold now and an additional 10 upon retrieval all right nothing to block the muscles no not at all but i have to say with a fine smooth head it does need a little decoration if you don't mind me saying (chuckles) you i was thinking-- and she whips out what looks like this fancy engraved leather cap with two straps on the side and just (shoomf) right over your head it kind of folds everything in the straps just go very long and dangle there laura and she takes them and snaps them underneath to where these two little danglies are dangling from under the chin and it just has these really intricate flower patterns punched into the leather all around i think it speaks of the seasons it looks almost like the old football helmets it looks masculine you wouldn't believe here let me show you and she brings up a small mirror exactly men will fear you walking down the road well all right spikes spikes let me see what i can do marisha laura and and she runs off down the way gets into a bag and you start hearing things going (tink thud) something rolls over-- ah shit eventually she comes out this is less of a hat and more of a half-helmet but maybe it'll do and she pulls forth what looks like this very wide metal brim almost in a swish shape to a point in the front yeah it kind of looks like a conquistador's helmet but it's only the front so it's almost like a rhinoceros horn that sticks up to a point and the rest buckles to the back of the head so it's a giant metallic groove for the front oh that's what i like to hear this will be 50 gold try it yourself it's all right it can be sharpened it's more for decor it's not meant to slice somebody in half well i mean what are you intending to do with this hat (titters) i can do that for you my big muscley man so after about five minutes or so she grinds down with what materials she has to a little more-- it does mess with some of the polish on the very tip of the metal but it does come to a more solid point be careful with that it goes on and then straps tight in the back to fit your head kind of it's like a big old rhino horn that curls upward to a point there it looks a little ridiculous well so they tell me make a deception check with disadvantage yes deidre goes (laughs) you silly tiny man-- no seriously we have a price agreed upon pay it ooh all up front all right it'll be ready for you shortly she takes the coin thank you for the patronage return here in about ooh an hour and the hat shall be prepared for you sir-- what's your name scanlan shorthalt all right come soon (shoomp) laura and (creak) you have to kind of pull it out yeah you leave a nice big groove yeah (laughs) all right eventually you all gather again back at the hall of the slayer's take you guys have just settled in and are free to continue any discussion you like as you see scanlan and grog come in say you've since retrieved your hat with your various wonderfully-crafted accoutrements you can see the bottom of her mouth okay make a perception check 9 you go running straight out of the door-- you guys are like oh no pike she's already out the door over the stairs (repeated thuds) outside of the hall (sounds of dismay) travis and you guys rush out to go catch her and the helmet is actually embedded partway into the ground and she's kind of-- and she's just laughing you haven't seen mertin vanessa doesn't seem to have left i mean there are a few individuals here that are part of the guildhall the hierarchy here is more like the few that run it and then everyone else comes and goes as they please you look pretty rough yeah we could-- we got a washroom in the back if you need it you get what you get it's water buddy the gruff individual chuckles heh it never is i need you to make a tinkering check yeah yeah it'll take you a little while sure oh my god all right take your d10 well your proficiency is what you get with the roll and then it's your dex bonus 23 what did you roll naturally ah taliesin and wow all righty what are the nifty things mm-hm right (laughs) it takes you a few hours and gets you into the early parts of the evening but you do manage to go ahead and complete it you manage to get it finished up and you're pretty proud of your work actually and you feel-- the whistle you're still doing as you do the final bits you realize is the song that scanlan sang for you just looping in your head it happened to push you through your work and get your final piece completed okay okay i'm excited okay (laughs) try me okay do you go and deliver it okay as the sun begins to set in vasselheim you make your way back over to the braving grounds which as you look across too as the night goes dark the braving grounds itself has a whole different life to it there are so many forges and smelters going that there's-- most buildings have this bright orange glow through the ceiling and these various openings where fumes and smoke and exhaust are sent up from the various production constructs and such it has this very luminescent look in comparison to a lot of the city it's very interesting it reminds you of the deep deep portions of kraghammer where most of the actual fire and melted rock was being smelted and gathered and heated so you make your way to the hovel the roof workers are no longer there and the door is closed (muffled) i'm sleeping (muffled) you want me to sleep you hear (scraping sound) a bunch of different locks fiddling (series of clicks) (fwoosh) and the door opens and you see victor clean-faced for the first time you've really seen him before and he has a nightcap which sort of (foomf) in front of his face with a little puffball at the end he's like i told you i was trying-- oh hey (hesitantly) percival thank you it's comfy to sleep in did you bring my hand come in come in (grunts) and opens the door you see he's wearing this long nightgown that is covered in patches and tears in it most of it has been turned black through soot but the cap is perfect perfect condition they are comfortable as he walks in still bandaged on the arm you can see there's a small kettle of tea set by the small fireplace right there it's a tiny little table and a tiny little stool that he's just kind of sitting on right there and he goes and he reaches over for the kettle (groans) tries to pick up the cup and just pours the tea into it (confused stuttering) ooh eh oh oh eh i just got that oh (chuckle click) (excited laughter) tea need another cup (grunts) he stands up and goes over still holding the kettle and splashing everywhere and he's flipping through cabinets and knocking pieces of glass out ah found it pulls out another little ceramic cup and pours the tea in sets it down (chink click) (cackles) to new hands it is pungent it is bitter but it definitely cleans out the sinuses and there is a hint of gunpowder to the flavoring you get the sense that pretty much everything in this room is marinated in some way shape or form to be flammable it can put hair on your balls not in uh weeks maybe did you make her hand too no she paid well though are you guys in a club now how many people want black powder tell me tell them bring them more i could use money (others laugh) uh (mutters to himself) (click click) maybe 12 hogsheads worth she only come by once please do i have more tea many different flavors this is i call dark roast i want to try the other one before you go (click creak) come on need this too (creak click) (cackles) (thunk) he sticks it into the wooden stool and the table kind of breaks the wood and snaps it oh (cackles) yes thank you good night (slurps) you leave and he's just sitting there staring at this long chisel point going (quiet cackling) the door slowly closes behind you okay you make your way past the quad roads at this point at night the whole clientele has shifted most people coming here-- you hear laughter you hear music the quad roads is the new orleans of the town comparatively it's still nowhere near as rambunctious as many places you've been but for what seems during the day to be a rather dour and serious business type city the quad roads is where the celebration of humanity hits when the evening hours hit so you come by and there's some taverns that are open you see to a certain extent what even appears to be an adult entertainment district you make your way beyond-- it's the oldest profession you make your way all the way to the outskirts of the duskmeadow and there amongst the just barely peeking through the cloudline starlight the looming dark structure that is raven's crest okay you go ahead and push the door open (creak) doesn't appear to be anybody there okay you walk in (clicking footsteps) at this dark hour looking around the obsidian-type walls are translucent glass on the other side though you can barely make out through the material the details of the outside world due to the lack of light across the cityscape especially here in duskmeadow in which the magical lantern light that illuminates the city streets are relatively sparse on this side of vasselheim you take a few more steps in (clicking footsteps) footsteps echoing across the long thin dark material of the floors (creak thud) door closes behind you (echoing) hello hello hello (echoing) this this this this (thump-crash) you hear the sound of some sort of low distant hit and a rumble and you see a distant light appear in a chamber just beyond the walkway just faint enough to illuminate and give the presence of some sort of life or movement about a hundred or so feet ahead of you you enter the next chamber where you see the interior of this structure is ivory-white bone and glass with a blue hint very much resembling the interior of a very naturally beautifully-carved ice cavern there is a stairway that ascends as well as other hallways that lead out from the central nerve center of the lower floor of the main structure as you walk into this central chamber you see ever so faintly at the very top of the stairs a pair of feet (footsteps) walk and disappear up the stairs okay you go running up the stairway (thud thud) you get to the top and you can see at the very top of the stairs a dark wooden door with a dark iron rim and what appears to be a large hanger or handle or knocker bolted to it and it (thud) just closes as you come underneath the top of the archway and up the stairs (doosh) once (doosh doosh) with each hit you can hear the reverberation of the echo of the knock through a much larger chamber beyond as soon as you release the actual door knocker the door (thump-crash creak) just creaks open ever so slightly into a very very dark chamber you can see very very little in here other than the basic outline of what looks to be a little bit of floor some sort of a smooth glassy surface that refracts just a little bit of light that makes it through what looks to be some sort of broken-up glass dome-type structure above you you can't make out much beyond that it's very dark in here as you step out of the room you hear a whisper come from beyond the chamber within the darkness it says is it yourself you wish to fix or something more then come let us talk have faith step in join me all right as you step into the chamber freezing cold as your toes-- your legs your whole body eventually finds itself stepping into this thick freezing liquid you hear the whisper in your ears just as your head reaches the level of the blood that says come come to me with your questions just as your head goes beneath the surface you're underneath and in darkness feeling around the thick material kind of just swishing your fingers around but amongst the liquid you still hear the whisper again in your ear come bring your questions you swim downward and you touch the bottom of the pool you reach a somewhat concave smooth floor to the pool you head to the surface there's no surface it just keeps going you do not you begin to panic you begin to reach around and try to swim up and find the surface but it just keeps going the liquid's thick and it's hard to pull through and you can't open your eyes and you can't see anything and the iron-like flavor is starting to find its way to the inside of your mouth as it's seeping through your nose and your ears you begin to panic even further as the cold is starting to take and you feel your muscles beginning to shake and seize from the onset of hypothermia you begin to head to the bottom of the pool again and this time you crack your head on the bottom in the middle of your stupor and you reach up and scream in pain as you do the blood fills your lungs and you begin to feel yourself drown you begin to shake and convulse as you begin to try to find a way to force it out of your body and you can't and at that moment where all of a sudden you realize that this is it this is the end this is how the tale of percival comes to an end the sensation goes warm again and it's like all that cold energy goes away and you're now swimming in water then air and the pain subsides and you're breathing normally but you still stand in darkness and you hear these distant footsteps (clicking footsteps) sourceless no light just shadow and you look around over your shoulder and then right behind you you see immediately a white porcelain face the head is just standing there amongst the shadow i've watched then ask them many things are released in this world many terrible many wonderful many things ask the right questions the mask which has not shown any expression at this point pulls back a little bit from you and almost seems to grow in size it's strange the proportion seems to stay the same but suddenly your vision shifts and you realize no it's farther away from you and is just suddenly immense like your visual focus just changes and your whole perspective suddenly causes you to lose sense of scale and balance the voice comes in this time louder you were always broken percival and you were preyed upon just as it preys upon others and will continue to do so until finally destroyed perhaps your deeds will guide your path to salvation or damnation the choice is yours you skirt that line still i've already helped percival do not think the path that you and your allies walk goes unseen there are many of those in this world that represent the will of us just as there are those who represent the will of those that combat us and always have there are a great many deeds ahead of you it's your choice to take them just know should you not watch yourself you may not find yourself on our side all life is inherently broken from the start percival take solace in that there is no perfection in life otherwise what would be the purpose of death it's to try to find ways to better yourself before the end that gives us purpose you are all broken but also understand at this point her voice gets very deep and very resonant mortals can achieve great things i did and the mask pulls back into the shadows and suddenly (gasp cough) you begin coughing finding your way to the surface pouring blood out of your mouth and coughing and eventually you find your way over breathing heavily to the side of the pool and (grunt) pull yourself onto the side (cough) cough the rest of it up a little bit of moonlight peeks through and you can see the beams refracting through the purples and reds and blues and just hints of specks of light that just shimmer across the surface of this dark glass-like floor you do so okay all righty so as percival finally wanders in is there anything else anyone wants to achieve before the evening's done we're still evening at the moment if there's anything else you wish to achieve otherwise-- you do manage to draw a comfortable bath for your brother and wash him clean you aid him in washing himself clean so you specify it's going to be late okay you do notice percy enter looks a little frazzled but doesn't seem to-- make a perception check i want you to make a dexterity check marisha and you see just faintly behind one of his ears and at the edge of his collar on his coat just a bit of familiar crimson and a look of a distant stare that is familiar okay so the first 12 hours are completed but you do not sleep written by john cleese it's a wonderful piece okay yeah fair enough all right you guys all find yourself to rest except for scanlan who takes a point of exhaustion for going through the night without sleep yeah basically it means any ability checks any skill checks until you get a full night's rest are at disadvantage yeah all right as you find yourselves to rest most of you the morning light comes greeting you to a new day and we're going to go ahead and take a break we'll be back here in a few minutes guys reminder once again loot crate our awesome sponsor check them out at lootcratecom/criticalrole enter criticalrole-- one word-- to get $3 off a subscription we'll be back here in a minute guys joe mad poster for the dx boxes so be active in the chat welcome back guys so as we return to the game the morning comes to you all in vasselheim as you awake in the slayer's take guildhall a brisk morning but not too cold the clouds are actually a little more separate this morning you get brief moments of blue it looks like the weather is a little clearer than you're used to seeing in this vicinity but the day is yours what do you guys wish to do yeah he picked up the hat you guys are right now having breakfast in the guildhall there's maybe two other individuals in the room one of them is drunkenly asleep and snoring the other appears to be going about their business you can specify a target in general terms you have no knowledge of the feywild you have a general idea of it somewhat-- somewhat just through your learning you never actually visited there the feywild is a near plane a plane that overlaps this prime material plane it's a version of the world you live in right now that is shifted and changed in a place where time distance is relative and shifts nature grows rampant and in cases is hard to really expect its direction things and entities exist there that prefer to trick and lose wanderers it's a very strange place where some believe elves initially come from or craft from there at least you have no idea you don't know anything about the transition to the feywild you just know that certain doors open at certain times especially with full moons in certain locations the classic toadstool rings areas where the moonlight in the realms can be a little thinner and the barrier doors do open and those are where creatures can transition out or through you do know it's a place of fey magic it's tricky it's difficult to follow very like oberon and titania weird interesting yes you guys missed six episodes (exaggerated sounds of relief) the ozmit sea is to the east of you east-southeast and that is a wide gulf that separates-- from your perspective looking at me there's othanzia ozmit sea and there's tal'dorei right here i'll have both of you guys make history checks you barely know what glass is right now explain make an intelligence check natural 1 doesn't quite come to you but what it could be the idea of a volcano possibly comes to mind but-- yeah you have not been there you haven't seen it but some of your crewmates while you were traveling aboard your ship for that five six-month period a couple of them did mention something about on the sea a mirage-like island that glistens in the distance but they said to avoid it said it was dangerous no you know of the shrew you definitely know of the shrew come around again yeah it was good what's the plan all right as you guys walk outside of the slayer's take guildhall you find the nearest tree which you've used before to traverse as you all step through the portal percy and scanlan look over their shoulder at the distant skyport and see the one airship docked there and think one day you jump through and emerge out the other side as you step out of the portal you find yourself jumping out of the center of the sun tree what do you want to do as you finish this thought you hear this sound emerge (vacuum sealing sound) and realize it's the sound of the whole portal you've made closing behind you because it only lasts for six seconds and you should probably get the hell out of the tree as you step out a voice goes hey boo sorry(kiss noise) (laughter) you guys emerge due to the time differences you land here in whitestone looking at where the sun is in the sky it's early afternoon as opposed to the morning where you guys just stepped away from there are people in the streets and you see a few a little bit of life has returned to this town square though still by comparison-- there are folks now that are bringing in actual healthy looks to be fruits from nearby trees there's a little bit of trade going on this is the first real chance you've had to see a little bit of whitestone coming to life again as you emerge from the tree a few individuals nearby stop and look and smile and wave recognizing you as you approach actually no there are not there are no leaves on the sun tree okay you whistle as loud as you can for a little bit nothing you head off and asking around you find zahra is actually up in castle whitestone right now just poring through one of the studies of books and is just currently reading and reading on her own as you eventually ask around and find your way there entering the room you see her with a small set of spectacles at the end of her nose she takes them off and my darling vex'ahlia and comes up and just gives you a big hug and picks you up and sets you down i'm so glad to see you're all right you killed a dragon i knew you would i don't know he's testy these days i'm sure he's around probably down in the city somewhere he's helping where he can you know broody types yes you do oh i'm just learning about the history of whitestone and i'm very intrigued as to the actual properties of this stone the entire town is built on there's a lot of really really interesting things that can be done with the materials in these mountains i do you guys continue your conversation catching up letting her know how things happened and vice versa you don't get any info that any dragons have come by apparently there have been a few other arcane practitioners that have been helping set up some sort of barrier to help essentially dissuade attention towards the city the idea of keeping this place as far off the map as possible should any prying eyes find their way there it's in the process of being set up right now a few weeks probably based on what-- (sighs) if i'm able to use some of the resources here within the castle maybe all right perhaps i can wondrous what else are you guys trying to achieve here he told you guys that a long time ago (laughs) you start asking around you come across a few folks you recognize you find a few of the guards who helped you with the initial reconstruction of this city and such and asking around one of the nearby guards takes his helmet off and is like first off i am so excited that you guys are back i'm so glad you're all safe i heard that you were off to do some dangerous things well great i'm glad that you've survived looking for mr gilmore he's actually down with the realmseer they're inspecting the ziggurat underneath the city so you could head down there if you wanted to find him it's under the castle yes he puts his helmet back on thank you again for all that you do he clicks his heels together and continues walking through the city everyone else going with all right you make your way down to the basement area of whitestone castle into the family catacombs which have been cleaned up and you can see cassandra has put a little bit of care into restoring it to what it was before the tunnel that was carved in has been given a little more support and as you're making your way down a familiar tunnel the same tunnel where you had the showdown with orthax you hear a few voices from up ahead two familiar voices you hear the echo of some older gruff elderly gentleman and a little more rambunctious familiar voice as they turn the corner you see them deep in conversation it's the realmseer himself hunched forward with his white hair and balding top turns around and it's a great mystery to me that they can put a-- oh look they've returned vox machina themselves gilmore at this point opens his arms standing and healthy my god i've been waiting for you and all of you so graciously clean well i have you to thank for that still a ways to go well you all have kima to thank for that she's been quite attentive to my needs curious place this whitestone well the company's interesting the realmseer laughs he's like (chuckles) so i've heard we've spent a little bit of time looking at this strange oddity beneath the city and i'm not going to lie to you it's really confusing i've a few theories on it as does the arcanist but we're still comparing notes and we don't want to jump to any conclusions as tests have been inconclusive and rather dangerous so far however before anything else goes underway i believe there's a very important bit of business that we must attend to and he walks straight up to grog and just gives you a big hug and pats you on the shoulder and is like (chuckling) you big lug walks over to you pike and kneels down and gives you a little pinch on the cheek and is like looking as spry and smiley as ever i see ooh he turns to you vex'ahlia look at you i hear if my words say correct that you folks are a recent dragon-slaying bunch hmm (chuckles) good to know and goes to scanlan and goes to ruffle your hair and goes and you you my little bardish friend no you're actually physically little you are a tinier person so i've heard from all sorts of interesting folk i only hope one day to wear clothes as fine as you percival thank you for taking me into your home i'm happy to keep things lit (sighs) at which point he goes to look towards you the realmseer's sitting there tapping his arm he's like right get on with it we've got work to be done and shh you be quiet these people have saved my life keyleth sweet ashari princess you've grown i can see it in your eyes he gives you a big hug vax vax'ildan light of my eye smiling boy (laughter) as he sets you down he’s like ooh i shouldn't have done that my apologies don't touch that it's still very tender my sight is sore so this works out well but please these tunnels are dank and not becoming of us dinner should be happening soon and you should join us now that you've returned please let's talk over dinner let's talk over dinner that is part of the test nothing blew up things did go away we'll talk over dinner i hate to have this discussion without allura here i think this would only behoove the conversation if we're all present (chuckling) well color me intrigued it was a good wink finest in the land well come to the surface then this place is dreary you too eskil you all eventually make your way back to the surface to whitestone you and me both yeah it's all good (laughing) to dinner (shoonk) okay not a worry all right so as the sun sets you find your way down to the proper dinner table gilmore is there eskil is there cassandra is there you guys look fantastic fine outfits have been provided for the men if they wish to wear them as well some do not all righty as you guys sit down pleasantries are exchanged-- (yawns) pardon me you catch up a bit with cassandra partway through-- what within the next 15 minutes or so before food is brought to the table allura finally enters in a very very nice dress and says it is so good to see you all are safe she then gives you a big wonderful hug well she looks over this way and kima walks in for the first time you've seen her really out of armor since you first saw her her hair is also in similar braids to her side and she herself is wearing a golden dress though she's kind of like she comes in hello she gives you a hug and goes it's good to see you guys i'm glad you're all right this feels weird does this feel weird this feels weird that's what i'm saying do i have to wear-- he's not wearing anything do i have to wear-- you don't have to wear it kima it was just a suggestion i'm going to go change i'll be right back she darts off for a bit and allura smiles and facepalms a bit you guys catch up a bit as allura speaks about her and drake's escape from westruun kima eventually comes back wearing ratty clothing shirt pants the general wear she'd pick up throughout the city and is still carrying her small maul at her side it's like her little comfort blanket (thud) next to the table she scoots up next to allura gilmore snaps his fingers and wine begins to pour from the servants cassandra says well thank you all for coming i believe there is much to get underway here thisa so while you've been gone allura you've been doing this research for a bit thank you thank you so we've been trying to ascertain the nature of the ziggurat beneath the city the ziggurat itself is built over what appears to be an ancient temple of ioun the glass substance the diluted whitestone that has been reformed into glass is used as a very strong arcane current a lot of energy was being placed in this location as there is an actual what appears to be an arcane leyline a nexus point near and above whitestone hence the sun tree's placement and why it flourishes so well in this region but everything within a certain vicinity of this temple of this dark spot if you will is eaten doesn't vanish it's not cancelled it's taken devoured everything placed within that small little globule of darkness is taken somewhere as well now at first we thought maybe it was just destroying but the arcane energy we feel the flow of it it's drawing it somewhere meaning that this is not what i had feared to be a sphere of annihilation an object of complete destruction instead it feels like it's a siphon now a siphon siphons are very old siphons were used in the first war they were used as a means of transferring extremely powerful raw magical powers they were placed strategically throughout the world's crust at these various nexus points as a means of creating extremely powerful relics the ones that you seek the ones that made the vestiges themselves were crafted through the use of some of these siphons but they have been lost and many thought destroyed for a very long time or at least inert i have reason to believe that this may be one and it may be active as to where the other side lies i do not know because each siphon has two points perhaps i have no idea everything we've attempted to put through it that had any sort of magical connection whether it be through inter-planal scrying anything that would bring us to the other side of this is crushed consumed and transferred as part of it none of our rituals or enchantments will let us see through this spinning marble as you call it seemingly yes we're still delving into it and it may be a little while before we figure this out but this is the best i can ascertain with my knowledge at my disposal and the realmseer and gilmore can back up this research we've all worked together these past weeks and we're all kind of coming to the same conclusion she gestures to gilmore gilmore says i've only been on this case personally for a few days of rising health standards in my body and i've thrown everything i can at it honestly and it's all just come to nothing gone (pthbbt) you're telling me (laughing) i'm not sending a person through there gilmore cocks a curious eye to the realmseer the realmseer thinks and scratches his chin looks to allura allura looks down at the table with her arms crossed looks to kima kima's finishing her big drink i stay away from it it creeps the hell out of me not to my knowledge do you think we should be worried the difficulty in our research is most of our means of inspection are well of arcane nature we're open to all possible suggestions we're kind of at the end of our rope for the time being we may send a few of us across the way to well a few different places for more information may do a bit of traveling ourselves it seems hm please do they kind of look to themselves none yet but we've been very careful we're in the process of installing some semblance of (sighs) for lack of a better term sort of a screen ways to reflect and perhaps cloud anyone who attempts to peer too far into the northern regions of whitestone the last thing we need is any of these dragons finding their way up north where you've kept all of us and the refugees safe so we're trying not to piss any of them off while also trying to make sure that maybe they're not really looking behind this curtain of cloud we're doing our best to try and meet those standards allura leans forward on the table no i see you're right there is merit in that though it will be difficult many here look up to you they see you as the salvation of this city but i believe we can go about and speak with them and help instill the idea that it's for the better good that you are not mentioned allura says i did find some research on some of these vestiges you are seeking from what i could bring forth from the cobalt reserve in westruun there is an artifact that lies in the feywild swallowed by a terrible tree is that the name of it so you've found some information yourself (sighs) this tree that holds it it's a tree seeded by the betrayal of an archfey whose hatred burned into a black heart of disease the cleansing rivers of the gilded run prevent the spread of the shademirk bog that seeps from it it doesn't sound very fun no the shademirk bog it seeps from this tree it is held at bay by the rivers of the gilded run mm-hm from best i could ascertain from my research yes it is very possible i don't unfortunately most of the cobalt reserve was destroyed and i was under siege at the moment from the return of the dragons (sighs) i've not been there myself to be honest it creeps me out i did find also about the spire of conflux it is a staff that can bend the elements and was taken into the abyss by joran the sea-speaker hero of the verdant expanse about four centuries back and was never heard from again joran the sea-speaker perhaps i do have some research about the dragons as well i've done a bit of looking into the personality types the habits of some of these chromatics you may be coming up against the black dragon you seemingly already dealt with if word has come to me correctly which is magnificent and well done very dangerous let's hope they don't decide to strike back soon i did find that the white dragons they're more primal they're overall less intelligent than other chromatics and some of this information you know but what they do is they-- (sighs) well don't let the lack of intelligence lull you into comfort they are also unpredictable and raw dangerous hunters they stalk in ruined lands of ice and vengeance their memory is eternal they recall every slight defeat and have been known to hold vendettas for centuries and centuries they despise other dragons and this loose alignment with thordak is stranger than the others for the white dragon though vorugal's distance to the others is intentional most likely i mean the entire alignment between them is strange anyway but particularly with the white dragon they generally steer very clear of or are bent on destroying any other types of dragons that may wander in their midst green dragons in particular are manipulative liars by nature finding pleasure in power over others through deceit and promises of wealth and glory they corrupt they play subservience to other dragons then plot their demise to claim their hoards they're the seedy underbelly of the chromatic world if you will they amass powerful allies human and beyond to their will bending them and using them as tools their life and their very presence is poison to those around them and is the very basis of their danger they corrupt the air around them to be venomous i found a bit about this raishan you mentioned and word has spoken though little that exists out there that she is also a very practitioned weaver of the arcane arts so be warned i can imagine that's quite within her grasp i've heard rumors of her calling the sky down upon her enemies previous individuals that hoped to raid her space were swallowed in quaking earth as she laughed from above i mean most of these dragons lived their lives wherever they once were before raishan used to exist in the mountains outside of syngorn and actually had amassed a sizeable horde of followers lizard-men lizardfolk all sorts thordak we had banished yes thordak in particular now red dragons are true tyrants built on impulse and rage arrogant to the core they see themselves as rightful rulers over all and thordak the king of all other dragons as well he is powerful enough to amass networks of spies and followers far beyond just the dragons that we've battled i'm sure so the more time that passes the more powerful that network will become well we had through clever subterfuge managed to have a member of our team work as a follower of thordak work into his greater trust and convince him that to perpetuate his wealth his growth his strength that he needed to truly embrace the essence of fire and there are crystals there are remnants of the first war that exist in this world and others the very core of the elemental chaos itself the hearts of the titans left behind these heart-stones are the very basis or at least shadows of the basis of what made the elements when creation came to be we had found one of these on the fire plane but the nature of these is that they cannot be removed if they are brought beyond the plane themselves they generally shatter and the few that can be brought across temporarily the magics that contain them do weaken and those that attempted to harness their power leave it to ruin destroying all around them before it whirls itself into a frenzy of uncontrollable arcane mass and destroys everything nearby these were many of the fools who ushered in the beginning of the second war so essentially we convinced thordak to find one of these in the plane and convinced him that he had the power to contain it once there all of our forces gathered and we attacked him pressed him down and the gem that we had convinced him-- the heart-stone that we had convinced him to take into himself well we found a way to seal it to banish it permanently to that plane so that he could not escape she turns and you can see gilmore's sitting at the table like this i got a very good close at that dragon a very good close look to finish my sentence i've been drinking plenty of wine tonight don't judge me it is very expensive fine wine thank you grog it's wondrous but his mass his unforeseen size to a creature like that i couldn't help but notice that within his torso there was a pulsing heart of red glass he looks over to allura allura nods well if that is the case then it's i think there's very much a chance that he did escape with the heart-stone intact an intact heart-stone is the true source of power those have been carved from one an inert one or at least they carry but a smidgen of the power i think you're safe grog allura leans in again i have been keeping an eye on emon from this distance as well it seems that thordak's very essence twists the land with elemental magic my distant views of the city have shown the center of the town cracked with volcanic fire as he digs and burrows beneath the city itself their essence is created where they reside a heart-stone there are many i don't know he seems pretty lax from what i could tell from my investigations the major step in the conclave's plan is already over now they settle into the divided territories and forget each other now i feel that thordak is far too old and covetous to be content with just emon now this was vengeance which is now complete who knows what the next stage in his terrible design is there are very few permanent alliances between chromatic dragons i don't know but he was not that large when we sealed him hundred miles there were reports of the white dragon a week ago south of us far south of us just flying flying east no i've tried to scry but they're apparently protected against that now we're just getting now to that point it may be a few weeks before we're ready to go it's a lot to build and it's a very big space to protect but me and drake are working on some ideas (sighs) they're not forged they existed they were the hearts of the primordial titans that existed on this world before the gods even came here they were the true denizens of this world before any of us i'm sorry it's been a very tense time perhaps rest is in order for all of us it's been a lot i'm so sorry it's good to see all of you allura brightens up a little bit you can see that she feels guilty that she just did this information dump and is like (sighs) it's good to see all of you (sighs) well let us rest for the evening drinks the last of her wine stands up we'll talk on the morrow she gets up kima i'm coming let me finish laura and no seriously it's good to see you all i'm glad you're all right i should've been with you i didn't know you left is westruun okay does my house still stand (hesitant noises) oh it's fine object impermanence (glug glug) next time you're going there

up realmseer stands up all right everyone rest well see you in the morning and ah glad you're all safe good night everyone sleep well (laughs) you guys all going to rest okay what do you want to do yeah it's still there okay (laughs) you cast the spell you reach out and touch the roots of the tree the roots of which have more color than they did before the dull gray has become more of a full brown the earth here smells of fresh damp earth the tree while still in the winter phase is definitely teeming with life to where it once didn't mmm not really in speaking to the tree you can ask questions but you're not quite-- you find yourself unable to tune into that or tap into that source of magic at this place at least hey bud much better (laughter) sun tree a-ok (laughter) yeah tree cancer what that sounds sad but no i don't know a tree like that sorry i've been here in whitestone since day one (laughter) so i graduated from berkeley and made my way to whitestone (laughter) (groans) yeah yeah long way kiki long way (laughter) nah just right here pelor put me here for a reason yeah sure speak for yourself kiki you too (laughs) all right the one in the cemetery is still under construction that one needs a little more work most of the graves have been refilled the corpses have been brought back most of the dead that were brought forth from the previous owners have been returned that was one of the first orders of business that people who live here did was to return their families to the earth there would have been yeah okay all right you come back to the study where you originally found zahra she's still there poring over books but is now half-asleep she has a little candle that's starting to flicker out and she has her feet up on the desk and her tail's kind of curled up and she's falling asleep into the book as you walk in what sleep's for the boring what do you ask percy intriguing all right very well i'm sure it can be done i never owned a crypt before i'm excited she takes the vial and puts it on the table okay go ahead and make your tinkering check that'll do all right everyone else going to rest make a perception check looks clear all righty a lot of time passes a few hours pass before she returns but she eventually does all right make a perception check as you approach the door you look down and see a smear of dark reflective oil across the walkway about two feet leading up to your room you guys have a cluster of rooms in this long hallway and it arcs around like an l so you guys are in this big l of all your rooms scattered throughout yeah it's pretty slippery the hand stays for a minute then-- yeah it's pretty thick also has a fume to it all right well done all right you guys all get into bed anything else you want to get done okay you guys all find yourselves back to your respective rooms resting for the night some doors adorned differently than others partway into the evening's resting we'll say the wee hours of the morning post-midnight or so your door opens slightly vax you hear a little (knocking sound) on your door you look over and you see gilmore pop his head in with a soft smile i'm sorry if i'm waking you up here and he produces what looks like a folded pile of material and throws it on the foot of your bed and goes come vax i made you a gift put it on come walk with me awhile we have a lot to talk about it's a very well-crafted silk robe of dark blue and black beaded nice against the skin it's really really nice that's fantastic all right he waits for you patiently in the hallway so he begins walking along puts his arm out to you you take his arm you guys walk up along the hallway he leads you to a staircase that leads up further and he goes i know a lot has happened these recent months i've been watching from afar keeping tabs on your journey best that i can but i still know so little you ascend the lengthy staircase and you make your way to the higher floor you eventually open an intricate door and walk out onto a wide balcony on that tower that overlooks the grounds and the castle before you beautiful moonlight the night air you see the moon is nearly full and the white light illuminates the densely-forested countryside surrounding the castle he closes the door and walks up to you at the edge of the balcony looking over it all elbows on the edge some time has passed vax and much of the world moves on to newer greater threats but true pain never really heals he turns to you and steps up to you looking you close in the face you hurt me deeply and continue to hurt agony for weeks months pain i had never experienced (deepening to a growl) it's all i can think about you would if you had time the pain hits you suddenly before anything else does as you're lost in that face and the sudden feeling the sensation of terror and horror you suffer 18 points of piercing damage and i need you to make a constitution saving throw mm-hmm you feel the poison-- roll again you feel what should be a pulse of poison hit your system and you manage to fight it off as suddenly you look down and there is gilmore holding a blade thrust into your stomach your robes now beginning to fill with crimson red around the wound it's at that moment you see him pull you in and stare into your face with a very low growl it's all i think about and you watch as a flicker to his form happens and you see for a second there's a flash not skin but fur you see teeth you see whiskers and the hand holding the dagger is facing the other direction that's where we're going to end tonight's session (shocked exclamations) (laughs) we'll be back next week what a rakshasa does (laugh) you also happened to lean in real close-- and whisper in the ear of the rakshasa as he slowly slit its throat across the floor yeah it just wants to come back and show you the same love oh boy this will be interesting next week when we kick in guys great game tonight awesome well guys we're going to go ahead
