that you feel would be incriminating then to infiltrate the high-richter's home do the same and then report them to the lawmaster or whoever else you'd think would be of higher estate this is transpiring tomorrow evening where we last left off it was later in the afternoon after your final discussion you guys have a day to prepare however you wish to mighty nein what would you like to do orentha that's the high-richter right now you guys have just finished meeting with the other members of the knights of requital in-- song and supper yes no longer at the job postings you had seen on the task board outside of the king's hall they were handwritten but they all had been written by the herald of the hall he was the one who was handling most of the jobs that were being distributed whatever information comes to him he's the one who posts them it seems (laughing) i was going to make you roll for it but no you got this it's later afternoon don't pull a liam all right you guys make your way following nott who had previously trailed dolan to the home and you eventually find your way to the outskirts of a very simple-- it’s a hovel but only because it's been in disuse for a while there is a single front door it looks to be a two-chamber home with one large central main living space and one bedroom in the back the roof itself is made of heavily pressed-together thatch and stick as soon as you approach you can see that the front door is closed and you see a little bit of movement through the window someone walking around from what you saw yeah yeah two buildings over you look off to the side and there's a small alcove of shade where you could probably pop in quickly and dispense a spell without it causing any ruckus the same figure you brought to the high-richter's all right okay doesn't take a spell slot all right knock on the door all right as you knock on the door there's a pause and you see out of the corner of the window the edge of a face peek out there and then disappear behind and a voice goes who is it you hear some rustling some unlocking process and the door opens up and you can see horris opens the door and dolan's behind yes please come in looks just past you as you enter the building and they close the door behind you it's just the two of them at the moment okay they both pause for a second oh wow all right you are as skilled as they say it seems that's pretty useful oh right his abode-- he lives in the gilded willows in the tri-spires he's i would say not too terribly far from the skyscape park and where the constellation bridge tower stands it's a three-story house dark wood gold leaf carving it's a bit gaudy hard to miss amongst some of the other ones there although all of them are gaudy in their own right look for the three-story iron-gated dark greenwood building in that vicinity unfortunately no most lords are very careful with documentation transfer back and forth they usually go through direct parcel services oh no (chuckles) nothing that was directly from his hand at least they usually go through intermediaries for that purpose i mean that would be the one that replaced us-- and he nudges over to horris on the side that would be-- i had that written down somewhere in here oh shit it's my older notes exactly i believe it's ren sutan yes if not the internet will correct me oh no lord diedric sutan is his name ren-- ren is his son who he placed to destroy and take over our practice you hear horris off to the side arms crossed now hearing all this goes yeah you could say that they both look at each other and you watch as dolan glances out the window not that far outside of the apple tree tutorship vicinity you will find a white and peach building with a few banners in the front and that's ren's new practice yes i mean sure he looks confused (laughter) he looks back at horris horris is like right well if you come across any dark physicianry please do your best to quell it where it seeds (laughter) thank you you're not there no worries i suppose since-- tomorrow evening when everything's set to go me and horris kara we're not going to be present when all of this goes down so we have deniability when we turn our information in for this whole endeavor but i think ulog and you guys should meet on the outside of the tavern that we met at earlier today to kick this off you got it well good luck and-- all right locks the door the eye peeks through the window once again (door opening) no that would make this a lot easier sorry you too (door closing) constellation bridge tower and skyscape park you got maybe an hour and half to two hours before sunset you both make your way toward the tri-spire as you make your way towards the front entry gates there one of the guards posted there is familiar with you and begins to let you through as you approach-- as you pass through a few steps behind jester the guard approaches “halt i don't believe i've seen you through here before very well steps back you guys make your way following the directions to the gilded willows you see the massive tree-tops that fill out the skyline from your perspective every home seems to have a row of greenery between it's a very very beautiful neighborhood you can follow where the constellation bridge tower as a beacon and as it guides you towards its area it doesn't take long for you to see the large gaudy three-story complex that is lord sutan's home you can see the gold leaf carving along the edges of each of the various stories in between the dark green slats that are there are coated in some sort of a lacquer material that almost glistens in the sunlight as it passes the sunset colors now starting to make their way into the cloud-covered sky you do see marble pillars at the corner of the estate's grounds with iron gates that link each of them with about maybe five foot bit of simple lawn-hill that separates the gap between the gate and the building itself well the gates on all them are solid except for in the very front and the very back both of them appear to be closed and locked you do see posted at the front of the front door there are two crownsguard that are there keeping watch on the back end as you case around to the rear side of the home there is a singular crownsguard and a dog that is on a chain make a perception check it's hard to see where any perspective would be a blind spot for entry other than above or from the sides because the front and back seem pretty well covered by these guards as they're currently posted and standing there so the only things that really make sense would be either flanking the building or something that guides you over top that's all you can think of the one that is immediately to the left of it is two-story it's a shorter building there is a tree to the immediate right of it that rises up to about the height if not a little taller than the actual home itself the building next to it is another two stories this one lords over the other buildings but there is one large tree that is about five feet from the edge of the wall it's five feet to the wall and then about five feet from the wall to the actual building so it's a ten foot from the tree to the roof you could certainly try the gate's about eight feet tall and the building is three stories so i mean there are some roof-edge perches the stories kinda taper with each additional floor so there is a small space maybe a foot a foot and a half wide that you could shoot for if there was something you wanted to try but-- there are no windows on the base floor or at least none that you can see the second floor you do see one set of double windows that open though they are currently closed those are on the two side edges of the building no there's no balcony the only balcony you saw was in the large balcony at the front of the high-richter's home but not on this one as you glance at the back of the building the doors that you see immediately there is one set of doors that is the front with the two guards are the back where the other gate entrance is there isn't another door that leads into the home there is a double-cellar door that descends beneath that is what is currently being guarded with a man and the dog do you have a climber's kit the new d&d nightmare mode you're all level one bards with nothing but ball bearings go unfortunately-- well the wall is an iron gate they're all long iron fencing gate there are the marble pillars at the corner of each one so it's open it's a series of bars they are they are poodle impalers do you want to try it okay okay as you place your hand through the bar-- nothing happens no it's fine game over you're not there shh that's true you're right sam (coo) bonus action (coo) (laughter) can we please make the metagaming pigeon a thing now i've played with a few in my time (laughter) all right anything else you guys want to do while you're there okay do you guys want and try for a climber's kit on your way back okay it takes a little bit of time to find a place because some of the shops are starting to close past sunset the time it took you guys to get there do a full casing and come back the sun has set and the sky is getting darker however thankfully a climber's kit is not all that expensive with a full cost on that-- come on climber's kit-- ha i was wrong 25 gold just the grappling hook two gold (laughs) right can i get a consultation first (funny voice) ah climber's kit includes a lot of things (normal voice) includes special pitons boot tips gloves and a harness that's for mountain climbing yeah some nice core balls you can sit on yeah so you want a grappling hook and rope you can get those those are cheaper grappling hook is two gold and the rope-- you want silk or hempen that would be hempen so that's one gold so three gold for a single grappling rope and rope so mark down that you have a grappling hook and 50 feet of hempen rope all right as you guys are accomplishing that the rest of you-- the rest of you what are you doing (laughs) the tutoring village make an investigation check twelve okay it takes you a little while to get there you haven't actually been to the tutor village before okay same difference so you manage through asking questions and finding your way around you manage to get to the tutor village right around sunset you do see about one block over the large white-peach building that you had previously been told by dolan you see the sign up it's called the guided hand infirmary it's one story but it stretches wide towards the back it's like a large shotgun building the guided hand infirmary you can see light from the interior there are two windows at the front and a row of windows as it continues down the back of the alley the alley you can see actually lights up because the bright interior warm light reflecting off of the buildings on the opposite side down the alley on each parallel end of it the building itself seems fairly well made there's elements of a plaster material put against the wood to make it seem a little less cracked and broken on the vicinity around it it looks like a little more money went into this complex than a lot of the surrounding buildings as frumpkin curls up and jumps onto the windowsill and you glance through the vision of your familiar the first window you come across inside it's a simple room it’s painted a similar white peach color there's a single bed maybe twin size with a single sheet you see an individual who is currently lying on it with not quite caleb dirty clothes but not an upperclassman by any means upperclassman not what i was going for that's fine wooo sydney football rules weird but you do see this individual is currently has a full arm bandaged with blood soaked and dried on parts of it and they are currently asleep and the door is closed there is a lantern inside that is set to keep the room warm yeah have him move around go around the front as frumpkin keeps watch on each of these each chamber seems to either be empty or there's somebody in some state of either rest or waiting you see one person a younger girl maybe fifteen or sixteen years old who is waiting on the edge of a bed sitting quietly in a room by herself glancing around she looks over and sees frumpkin and goes kitty and makes the hand motion to try and pet-- you go around the back door and you can see one room has two beds that currently have two individuals that are coughing heavily they're sick with something pretty bad and there is a person inside that is dressed in a white robe that is in the process of bringing them both broth but they have a mask over their face a piece of cloth tied behind and it looks like they're treating some diseased patients this is for all intents and purposes an infirmary it's a one story building but it's quite long it goes back quite a bit other buildings are spotty and build the space around the outside of this block whereas this infirmary stretches the entire length of the block correct it looks like all-- it looks like it's built so that all the rooms that have sunlight are the rooms where the patients would stay anything important would be kept in the interior of the building the roof is about i'd say 12 feet up as you're focusing fjord you notice a small child maybe five or six years old this scruffy reddish hair and a dirty smashed face walks up and goes what happened to the kitty i was going up to pet it and it went away oh i'm simon he's a real boy (laughter) okay he runs around the other side of the building frumpkin is on top and looking at the top the front of it looks really nice the top which nobody sees doesn't look that great it's a pretty shoddy wooden slats over wooden slats across the entirety of the roof complex you can see one small trap door about the center of it that is currently closed (meowing) at which point you hear a kid go whoa simon is now on the side staring at this disappearing and reappearing cat make a persuasion check 14 (screaming) and he runs it would take you about an hour or so to do so to a studied physician probably not going to hold up you can certainly try depending upon how high you roll about an hour you’re going to spend time and apply in the street that's up to you you can try and duck into a shady corner and spend an hour you can get yourself some evening scrambled eggs for five copper all right if you're gathering all those materials from a scattered meal-- we'll put it at about eight copper for the total okay i'm going to say for this go ahead and roll a d20 add your proficiency bonus and intelligence modifier yeah because this is about trying to come up with an accurate means of looking like you've been infected with something 11 okay you take an hour and you're pretty proud of it you think it'll work fine for a month there's alleys on each side but they both have windows that are lit so you would be in one of those vicinities you could you would be at a distance though all right so the two of you enter you go through the front door it's a double door it pushes open it doesn't appear to have resistance it's on a hinge you push in and at the front there's a clerk there wearing the same white robe a middle-aged man receding hairline short hair big bulbous red nose some pock-marking on his cheek he looks up can i help you he reaches down and pulls a cloth up and puts it immediately over his face okay um--  okay as you're doing that i need you to roll a deception check with advantage because you're helping 21 as soon as you spray in the face he's like (sputtering) takes the scarf off and (panting) sit down please he points over to a bench on the side take a point of damage the clerk at this point goes please stay tight i'm going to-- shit he leaves the room you walk in as you see there's a spray of stuff across the clerk's counter you see both mollymauk and fjord crawling in opposite directions across the floor as you hear footsteps and the clerk had just rushed out of the chamber down the hallway what you see now is there's two hallways there's one to each side as you enter where the clerk's desk was it looks like there's all the rooms you saw on the right side all the rooms you saw on the left side and there are chambers in the center of the building with the two hallways that bisect the two areas you can choose right or left it's up to you the clerk went down the right side okay as you're rushing with nott in your arms you head into the hallway on the left side and you glance and can immediately see another person with a robe who is holding a small satchel of some sort of greenish material they walk and see you excuse me can i help you make a deception check please what seems to be the problem he looks as opposed to being empathically interested in your well-being is genuinely disturbed by the sound the child is making rosemary's baby style roll an attack for frumpkin please that hits he's wearing a robe go ahead and roll we'll say it's one point of damage is a cat's scratch as it's clawing he's (screaming) he starts screaming and grabs frumpkin on his back and tries to pull him and throw him off frumpkin full-on spins scatters all claws and legs out lands on the ground (angry cat sound) full puff-up tail and everything at this point you watch another doorway flip open and you see a man come out with very short brown hair on the sides with a pompadour in the front and a similar white robe but it looks like it's longer-sleeved with more detail he goes what is all this ruckus happening what is a cat doing here get the cat he watches as the clerk says i don't -- shoo shoo shoo he's trying to get frumpkin to leave now there's now other workers of the infirmary coming out of the rooms that are all starting to gather the one who saw you in the hallway is now coming towards you while shooing frumpkin out you watch the guy who had left the chamber head back into the office and close it people are starting to scatter you guys are waiting in the two rooms now you said you found two separate rooms you're just running the hall what are you doing so you're coughing loud in the room you're crawling in the hall behind them we'll find out in a second now we have you spitting and freaking out the two clerks that are trying to push frumpkin out are trying to escort you they see you they're like “sir sir” they start grabbing your arms and lifting you up they start dragging you into one of the rooms on the side they open one room and there's somebody in there already who was sleeping but is starting to come to going what's happening sorry they close the door go to the next chamber and start dragging you into an empty room okay all right they open the door-- you bolt make an athletics check actually this would be your choice you try and pull away but in the moment they're genuinely worried about your well-being they've probably had patients try and make big physical actions while they're in their care and they hold you back devil's tongue or vicious mockery okay that's 11 what's your dc on it what's your charisma modifier it's fine they succeed you shout this and one of them (groan) they grab and throw you into the room you (whoosh) into the chamber and they close the door pushing you inside of it well what's the dc of the spell is what i'm asking that's okay it's fine they shove you into the chamber they close the door you land on the ground and you hear it lock behind you you are now a dangerous patient who needs other glancing while that's happening and they're distracted by that you guys-- i'd say about half of them are full you see two chambers that are empty all right you close the door you guys both make stealth checks real fast all right you enter the room and close it what are you doing (knocking) hello is there somebody in here the door opens and you see that there's a clerk who had apparently heard the door close behind you as you had entered the room and is now walking into this darkened chamber as soon as the door opens you guys are on the opposite side of the door he walks over towards the lantern in the corner to light it because the room is dark that you're in there's nobody in there at the moment he walks over oh wait wait you guys bolt past into the hallway you guys dart out to the entrance and out into the night air oh just out of the room you guys are out of the room and the person sees you well you guys find fjord there coughing loudly while you are currently locked in this room there is yeah well no there's a door it's a closed solid door and there's a window looking outside there's not no there is one cross bar that is maintained it's more to support the four panes of glass but that's it peek out the door sorry there's no window in the door okay while you're meditating on that-- fjord is alone in the room there are two clerks now that were originally fleeing to get help and have come back now with the gentleman with the short brown hair who's exited the opposite side of the chamber now we've brought the doctor he moves before the doctor who approaches all right so you appear to be sick make a deception check yes 16 he goes all right please have a seat in this chamber there's an outhouse about two blocks down outside come back --  get in the room we'll get you a pan you go in the room and one of them pulls out a metallic bedpan and sets it down on the side they close the door immediately and then turn to you two “we’ll get to him in a second what’s your problem” “let me see her” he comes forward and puts his hands out towards nott do you do that make an intimidation check with advantage 13 the physician goes (screams) falls back the other two clerks or physician helpers catch him “get it out get it out out shoo” make an acrobatics check to try and dodge past their grasp as you begin to dart through their-- as you run all of a sudden there’s a tug on your cloak and the same younger physician who had told you to get out is clutching the back of your cloak and lifts you up off the ground “well then someone’s going to play nice with the crownsguard” and turns and starts bringing you towards the exit “you too outside” yes yeah easily yeah you exit out and the two other ones are looking a bit confused he’s currently dragging nott who’s flailing on the edge of the cloak dangling out into the main area okay he goes and throws you out onto the street pushes you out caleb and goes “guard” and begins pointing loudly over there down in the direction of where you tumbled and landed on the ground you guys got shoved out into the front of the facility nott got tossed landed and stumbled a few feet and they’re now shouting for the guard and pointing at nott you guys start bolting as you guys run they don’t give chase because it’s not their job to do so but they start shouting and shouting i want you both to roll stealth checks to try and see if you can avoid the sight of the crownsguard that are in the process of responding to the shout okay as you guys dart into the nearby shadows plugging down a few alleyways you hear some voices in the distance some conversations some shouting and then some footfalls that get loud and then get a little softer and eventually a little softer and fade off you just barely scraped by on that one marisha and you however darted off towards the open office and as soon as you glance in there you can see there is a desk set up there is a chair there are a number of large books and stacks of parchment it looks like there is a whole rack up top with various medicinal herbs and salves that are categorized into small makeshift cubbies this is where a lot of the treatment seems to be mustered well it’s clear for the moment but the man who was just in this office just finished throwing nott outside and is in the process of talking with the crownsguard you don’t know how long you have until he returns you palm a bunch and throw it in there all right you exit just as you see them returning to the hallway with the physician straightening his outfit making his way in your direction doesn’t even make eye contact with you just brushes by and shoulder-checks you which is hilarious because the size of your visual is much smaller so it’s like (impact) “watch it” and was two inches away but doesn’t seem to notice in the moment that he actually did so makes his way into the office you hear the door close behind you and the two other clerks frustratingly start scattering and making their way to the other chambers one of them is talking to the other about “i don’t know what happened he went crazy and started spitting and was bleeding everywhere” and they’re both making their way to the door where molly is in okay you head back out onto the street you are in that chamber for a while are you doing anything make an investigation check ten nothing easily does so you can try and pry one of the panes out but there’s a decent chance it might break in the process if you’re not careful you’re going to try you take one of your blades and you wedge it up underneath where the metal bar is it’s holding the pane in place to see if you can wedge it out go ahead and make a straight dexterity check it shatters and breaks on both sides of the window you watch as the window shatters outward-- the pane itself is about that big so you’re going to take more of the window with you to do it all right you shoulder-roll-leap through shattering the window out of the infirmary rolling into the alley you see this happen as molly is a chaotic spill of glass shards and purple skin you guys bolt at this point as you head back you’ve now seen the guards that have just run off to go after nott hear the shatter and turn around to begin some of them to double back to where the sound of the glass breaking came from make a deception check it’s too late they are okay 15 the guards approach and they both look antsy but they see you pointing away and they both head in the direction that you were heading them off towards as molly’s about to leap into your arms you guys have managed to find yourselves back into the chaotic evening of the streets of zadash it’s like six which is still there by the way yeah as you guys make your way back to the leaky tap to eventually meet up going through the paperwork unfortunately none of them have anything that signifies the high-richter they all seem to be various quick notes on bones breaks and resets on various illnesses that have come through and treatments that have been applied keeping tabs on return visits it’s all various notes of-- nothing from lord sutan unfortunately if you had possibly searched a little longer you could have maybe found something you think but given the circumstances it did not occur so you didn’t find anything you wanted to and you probably definitely fucked up a few people’s recovery routine but that’s fine you guys eventually find your way back to the leaky tap your monk and your cleric are waiting for you and you watch as these four individuals walk in looking a bit haggard okay you work out the logistics of that letter-- the guard dog that was outside of the home it was a mastiff from what you guys saw of the mastiff it wasn’t a show dog by any means but it wasn’t a street dog they’re just using for the moment one way to find out it looks like it’s a utility dog you’ve seen some dogs go around with members of the crownsguard before as part of the general-- it’s more for an intimidation tactic they’re rarely ever utilized but the presence of a dog just make some people especially those who work in darker categories unsettled they were crownsguard all right as you guys work your way through preparing this letter condensing your plots for the next evening and eventually find yourself to a night’s rest in preparation for the next day’s events we’re going to take a break (laughs) fucking d&d those are my favorite moments of the game i’m like i don’t-- okay guys this is happening this is all your fault so yes before we go to break our friends at wyrmwood have their giveaway for the evening you need to be in the twitch chat room to participate right now the offer's only good for residents of the united states and canada excluding quebec because apparently quebec for the official rules you can find the link in the chat tonight but tonight it is the flame box elder deck box which is pretty awesome oh and it came with a magic pack with a guy going (screams) it's a deck box the pack comes with it too so go ahead and enter into the chat room-- the word for this break is “heist” h-e-i-s-t remember only enter it once if you enter it more than once you will be disqualified unfortunately we'll get to that and we'll have the winner in the break in the meantime we'll see you back here in a few minutes [break] okay as you finish the focus you glance down at them extending your consciousness to see if there's any residual magic energy they're not enchanted but they are made of a very nice solid platinum with a gold spiral lay on them once you pull the dust off so they’re probably worth a little bit of money for a goblin’s wrists they're pretty big looks like they're more-- they may have been made for a more masculine figure’s wrists probably or a thick-armed lass all righty anybody else have anything to do before the evening's rest or are you happy to continue the next day all right so as the evening comes to a close the next morning greets you on a somewhat chilled misty morning the sky gray but the light is out you can see a faint mist is burning off of the streets in the early morning like six or seven-ish you all gather yourselves is there anything you wish to accomplish during the day or do you wish to jump ahead to the meeting of the afternoon the evening yeah the festival is happening this evening i mean the harvest is celebrated at different points and in a few weeks is the official harvest end festival this is done in advance it's more of a private event that is for the more elite some folks come in from out of town from local smaller townships that are pretty well off and trying to rub elbows with the local elite it's a festival that contains food music drink you've never been to one of course and you've heard of it from the time you spent in zadash you've never seen it but you've seen folks take care through the street towards the event and it seems to be fairly like a more subdued mardi gras colors but the colors are more reds and browns and golds they have masks they'll wear for it but they aren't full face just habitual eye masks only some will some folks don't get fully into the spirit all right who’s helming the expedition to acquire costume pieces molly go ahead and make an investigation check (laughter) 11 it takes you the better part of the morning about noon you manage to find a place that will sell similar outfits since a lot of them are either custom-made for the individuals that are going it's hard to find a place there is no shop that sells fancy clothes to the random folks who aren't going to the event but you manage to find a few individuals that can cobble together a few masks and basic attire because it's a quick build it's going to be a little pricier than normal cost so the commission will take the better part of the afternoon and will be ready by sundown for enough outfits for six of you or accoutrements you'll be fine it's just a mask i'd say between all of you for the time the materials and the construction of it it’ll run you about three gold pieces okay how many sausages do you want in case you get hungry fair enough okay that's going to put you back a silver ulog is meeting you guys you want to try and search for him make a perception check you have no idea where ulog is or if he's in the vicinity unfortunately all right so you gather the outfits that were commissioned for you you have your materials as the day grows later eventually the sun begins to crest over the western mountain range the sky though cloudy still the colors begin to shift to the oranges and purples of dusk you begin to see carriages come through the streets and make their way towards the tri-spire district one of the carriages just passed you and it's about a block up the way if you want to try and catch up all right as you guys head back towards the entryway to the sewers where you had previously been with your various outfits and attire you can see now there's not two crownsguards there's a single crownsguard at the moment you approach and you see they're not directly against the grate they're across the street it doesn't appear to be watched at the moment the entranceway into the sewers well he's not looking at the entranceway to the sewer yes but there are lanterns and stuff up on the side of the street okay evening i am well how are you everybody else roll a stealth check please try the pentamarket probably make a persuasion check all right so down this way-- and he starts giving you the full play-by-play of the street corners to the pentamarket where a candy shop is that you had missed earlier so now you know there's a candy shop in zadash as it's happening what did you roll hold on so a natural one eight 19 15 okay natural one’s tricky still a natural one but yeah that brings it to nine as you guys begin to quickly slide in one after the other nott as you're rushing down you're glancing off because you hear them talk about candy for a second over the side as you rush down the side whack you hit your head and give out a natural instinct a pained squeak as you do the guard who's talking to jester goes “wha--” make a deception check seven “hold just a second” he begins walking over to the sewer edge he steps over and begins to glance down-- he’s looking back at you like-- from where out of the sewer you mean as soon as frumpkin-- he kicks and-- (gasps) well he got scared by the cat the first guy was a dick this guy was (yells) like kicking wildly anyway he falls back and frumpkin runs off he’s like (grunts) it seems to be enough to take him off the scent of nott and he turns around “miss” he walks up and helps you up right all right well go get your candy have a good night (sighs) he goes back to his post you guys make your way through the sewer back up through the t-intersection-- all right fair enough frumpkin does slowly make his way back to join you you make your way towards the gate and without issue are entered into the tri-spire you make your way towards the side of the alleyway where the-- you did not jester do you want to go do that you guys are sitting there waiting for jester to show up and meet you to let you out you however you make your way to the song and supper and on the inside you can see nervously at a table in a dark cloak ulog “what the--” gets up and meets you outside shoves you back out there and you both begin to walk side-by-side “i was waiting here long enough” make a deception check he goes “right well where’s the rest of your team” he looks down and he has fairly plain dark clothing for night-stealthing he has like a single-- looks like a gold chain of some kind with a single yellowish amber-orange bead on it that looks like it’s worth a gold or two dark green-brown cloak it’s hard to see the color this late at night he doesn’t look super rich yeah you put some of the festive wear on him it’s all not at all fitted for him and it looks like a kid who has outgrown his snow-outfit and he’s like-- “this is humiliating” he’s seething beneath it you can see him grinding his teeth but he follows you nevertheless you make your way to the gate once more the guards there-- one of them walks up and the same one from earlier gives you a nod “hold” make another deception check he goes “a comedian tell me a joke” ulog looks at you with the mask back at the guard “um--” he goes “what do you call the king on his birthday” the crownsguard goes “i don’t know what do you call a king on his birthday” “an arsehole” the guard goes-- (impact noise) at which point the two guards go (laugh) ulog like gets off the ground and glares at you this very furious fiery stare and then gets up and then stumbles again and falls on the ground flat again the guard goes (laughs) all right get in ulog now has like a bloody nose and as you ushers him in he looks back “oh we’re going to talk later” you eventually make your way over to the edge of the alley coming up to the hatch that leads you out of the sewer there you guys see the two approaching shapes of jester and ulog ulog looking festive if the wear is a bit tiny making his hair and beard poof out of the sides of the mask “well first off i’m pretty keen at infiltration i have a long past of doing sort of the breaking and entering thing plus i want to be there when this happens have a personal stake “i know the area alright” “do you think you know where he lives” “all right that’s all we need the rest we can all do lead on” yeah go for it 17 well there goes the campaign as you guys make your way through the city streets you can see the closer you get to the silken terrace for one the usual silk banners that adorn the various edges of the streets have been changed from the usual white silk banners to bright yellows bright browns bright reds the colors of autumn are now starting to show and appear throughout the vicinity you also hear the music begin to swell at the various performing bands towards the center where this gala is you can see all the banners leaning in the center space the sunset colors have vanished and now the night sky holds above the crownsguard are clustered in greater numbers in the tri-spire specifically to keep a perimeter around the event as you glance off to the entrance gate where you were you can see there’s now stationed more towards that space since you originally passed through more musicians are arriving some locally some appear to be from other areas within the actual empire the social elite are gathering in the center of the silken terrace and you can now see the small carriages are stopping and letting other individuals out to join the crowds the mingling beginning you can already see about 60 or 70 people with more still arriving they all have their various colors and masks on they’re all grabbing drinks and laughing and seeing old friends and introducing themselves to new people they haven’t met before some of them live in the tri-spire some that live throughout and beyond make a perception check make a perception check unfortunately you’re too far away and the masks obscure any of sort of details you’re unable to see anyone you recognize per se but you do see that there are long tables that mark the perimeter that are already holding already preset glasses of wine and ciders you can see the central tower of the triumph chime sits glowing right at the front and center of this gala it’s all surrounding the base of it and up in a spiral you can see lanterns and similar colors of autumn that spiral up the front of it you guys begin to carefully and out of sight make your way towards the estate of lord sutan please make stealth checks everybody pretty good spread you guys duck in between avoiding being seen and blend in with the crowd as you pass other individuals that are making their way to the actual gala event there are nods and smiles occasional laugh as folks are conversing and chatting as they pass you make your way over to the outskirts of the gilded willows beyond the skyscape park and where the constellation bridge tower stands to see for many of you the first time the three-story dark wood home of lord sutan the marble pillars mark the cornerstones of where the metallic iron fence gate matches the perimeter there’s a singular tree and still there are two guards posted at one and the same guard with the dog at the other well it’s been a day later seems to be if look at the-- if the building’s a square the house is mainly built as a rectangle there’s the front door and the back where the cellar door is and there’s the perimeter fence in the front there are two guards in the back where the gate and the cellar door is there’s a singular guard and his dog the tree is up on this side it’s just on the interior of it just within the gate correct probably not no “who’s staying outside” the two of you all right “if we can manage if what you’re saying about this tree we can possibly scoot past their visual range and not have to worry about it and just use that as a backup” “but we got to climb the tree” “all right those that are staying at the base the rest of us let’s get to climbing” it’s about five feet we get to the top you use your little cat thing to distract it preferably the other side of the fence right your cat on the other side of the fence while they're faced and focused in that direction we make our ascent that might be on one of you all right actually not a bad idea it's cloudythe sky itself is cloudy and has been even though the storm blew by it's still pretty heavy cloud cover those who are climbing the tree athletics checks please yeah you can do that so beau goes first for climbing we'll say athletics it doesn't have a lot of branches eight well you're not helping anybody (chuckles) you get partway up and ulog is actually like (grunting) he's doing fine so he pushes you up the rest of the way you climb up fine skittering up past them you actually climb over beau and ulog to get to the top first 11 that's fine you manage to get up there and caleb you guys all get up there beau is the last to arrive it's one if those things too where she starts first but each person keeps putting their feet in her face on the way up okay you guys get up to the top of the tree you're up in the branches in the bow at the top you can see now it's a beautiful view of the gala in the distance you can see the three towers all arcing up all lit from underneath from the lanterns and the light that have been significantly brightened for the events of the evening you have a clear shot of the rooftop which is at a slight decline from this current position it's about ten feet from you and about three feet down below you can see there are two smokestacks that look like they're attached to fire places that might be good indicators of places to connect the rope who's throwing the rope he takes it he's like all right you got to be pretty good at aiming this it's about 15 20 feet from here but can you aim it so go ahead and roll a d20 and add your strength modifier you throw it tink tink okay there's this roll of thunder off in the distance it didn't catch anything though and it's scraping pulling back a little bit-- it didn't manage to it got over to the roof but it didn't catch anything okay so you pull it and it scrapes falls and then dangles down you manage to pull it up a little bit dangle it up yeah are you just throwing it all right so he was holding the other side of it the grapple arcs up really high and arcs past there's a brief moment where you see it go up and then pass by you heading down towards the wall is anyone going to do anything you could try go ahead and roll it looks like it’s just out of the grasp she's going to try so go ahead and roll a d20 yeah that's fine so you manage to just catch it holding onto the edge of the rope before it clanks onto the ground it's just dangling now you pull it slowly back up you going to try okay and leap make an athletics check i'll give you advantage because of the step of the wind your jump distance is doubled yeah you're fine you're fine just roll for the hell of it i just want to see what happens you off the branch leap no sound you grab it affix it easily to one of the smokestacks you find up there all right ulog takes it and ties the other side of the rope you guys can all begin to shimmy across and make your way so the rope is set up are you guys just going to shimmy across you're not there you can't see it from here there's no balconies on this house make an investigation check 18 you don't find an entry way per se one of the chimneys is wide enough for someone to pass through it looks like there is a part of the roof that if you were to try and remove some of the shingles there might be some sort of entrance below it you're on an angle there on each side you watch as frumpkin runs past (cat yowling) outside of the gate immediately (dog barking) he's like no (guard stuttering) the dog drags him to the opposite side like around the outside into the fence and is now trying to bite and frumpkin's on the other side of the fence going (meows and hisses) (barking) right into the fence the guy's still holding back like shit no stop god stop it is pulling you guys all make it across--no one seems to notice none the wiser--onto the roof you guys are watching you guys are on-- perception check from both you guys that's up to them okay keeping an eye out there there isn't any at the moment notable individuals wandering towards or snooping around the house or your position so you feel pretty safe and change into a crownsguard okay got it you guys you are on the roof there are two chimneys there is the slight roof thing that you saw easy enough to do all right so the barking slows the dog is still barking in the direction of what was there and seems to be still really entranced with the possibility of getting that fucking cat frumpkin does find his way to you molly guys on the roof what are you doing some of them loosen and slip a little bit and you can see there's a very very faint groove on the wood beneath it like a gap okay (thunder rumbling) off in the distance as you begin to pry a little bit it begins to move up there is some sort of a hatch it feels like a trap door a little bit as it's pulling up the shingles that are overlapped on it are overlapping the gap and start sliding a little bit you immediately feel like if you open this you're going to send a bunch of shingles sliding off of the roof there is a very faint trail of smoke coming out of the chimney by the way so you begin to collect them where are you putting them okay so you take a moment to go ahead and carefully-- you have a collection now of roughly 23 roof shingles in your haversack so you can add that to your equipment we'll say it takes you about five minutes or so to finally get all those off carefully you manage to pry it open and it opens up ever so slightly and there's a chain on each end that prevent it from (slamming open) it opens up just enough that you can slip inside and there is a small ladder there that you can use to slowly get down into a small attic okay you cast detect magic right 30 feet in the vicinity okay it only goes down about five feet or so it's a very small crawl space you do it's a very small crawl space it's maybe like ten foot by five foot it's very dusty in here it looks like there are a few clay pots there looks to be a portrait like some sort of a large art piece that's leaning against the wall and has some cobwebs over it other than that it looks fairly empty like it hasn't been used fully you casting detect magic let me check real fast yeah so you look around the vicinity in this chamber and you do not see any sort of faint magical aura in the crawlspace make an investigation check you do find there is another trapdoor on the opposite end of the crawl space that is partially blocked by the art piece that's leaning against it you shift it out of the way and unhinge the top and it opens and drops down to a hallway that has like faint a crackling firelight inside this hallway you glance down inside you can see a long hallway with tapestries on each wall of a beautiful writing there are two ornamental armor sets that are set up on the side you can see an ornamental sword that is bolted on the wall on the opposite end and stairs not too far from where you are that head further down into the building and there is a doorway that leads to the right on the opposite end of the hallway he is but he is behind you guys at this point all right the two of us will keep an eye for traps he's giving you an advantage he's giving you the help actually you were down to casting what spell you were casting-- okay you go down and there are two torches that are burning in the edge but they don't have a fuel source they are an ever-burning torch and they are both fixed to the wall giving this flickering light in the vicinity you’ve come down to the hallway so you guys have made your way down into the hallway you’re still concentrating the spell right there are magical auras emulating from these torches they're both everlight you've seen this magic before they just continuously burn it’s continual flame you also get a faint magical aura from each of the suits of armor and a faint magical aura from the sword across the way on the opposite wall go ahead and make an investigation check with advantage what'd you roll a 20 20 you carefully go forward and both you and ulog pay attention the floorboards of this hallway progress one after another and there's a cluster about four of them about a-foot-and-a-half across each of them that are slightly lifted on one side glancing forward you can see there’s some sort of pressure device that triggers when those boards are stepped on you're not sure actually-- fine correct i would say-- that's an interesting question let me check something real fast we'll say it can go in two different ways i'm not entirely sure no no i do here it would be-- we'll say conjuration no transmutation which you know well jester as you finish concentrating on the spell and focusing on the wax seal you get a blip of its location in the next chamber beyond where you are in the door on the right as this is happening ulog is sighing loudly pulls out some tools and begins to fiddle with where the boards are on the ground he manages to get a shortsword of his pressed underneath where the boards are and slips it across slightly lifting each one as he goes until the sword peeks out the opposite side acting as a platform beneath he goes and carefully steps on the boards and then steps across with no effect roguesplaining technically as you guys head in there's the closed door that leads into the chamber where you're sensing this aura 13 okay it is trapped yes it's not locked but it is trapped make a perception check 15 you listen out you do not hear any movement in the house other than what you currently are making and a hiccup from out in the distance perception check from both of you guys by the way while this is happening okay you don't seem to notice anything all right so you guys-- all right you pull out your thieves'-- we'll find out go ahead and make a thieves' tools check so roll a d20 add your proficiency modifier and your dexterity modifier should be plus six i think 16 as you carefully get down to where the knob is you begin to turn it ever so slightly and you hear this spring begin to tighten and you're familiar with that sound so you manage to get your tool underneath and you find where the spring is it's barely in the space between where the door and the edge of the door frame is you get the tool underneath capture it and as you pull the door open it prevents the spring from pulling back into the device you slowly as you expose it reach in snap the opposing side and remove the spring entirely leaving the trap inert as the door opens into a fairly well-decorated master bedroom you see a large canopy bed a beautiful detailed embroidered rug that consumes the center of the floor you can see a fireplace to your right the one that you saw that was attached to the top of the roof that has a fire burning in it it has two giant statues of lions on each side this cool detailed shelf there you can see a table with chairs to your left you can see a slight opening to a balcony that's not visible from the outside okay you're just scanning the room all right as you glance in and look there is immediately to your left a large metal cabinet of some kind it is made of dark iron and gives a very faint magical aura to it the rug in the center of the room gives a faint magical aura as well you're looking for-- okay investigation check you glance around and look in the chamber you don't see anything that gives the essence of a trap to you it looks like the trap was part of the entry here but there's nothing immediately in the vicinity that resembles a triggering trap the carpet it's also transmutation and the magic on the large case has a faint abjuration it's underneath the rug mage hand very helpful when setting grappling hooks on roofs i'm just saying if i knew you could do that you could've-- investigation check you can only see magical sources from what you can see so if a thing's behind a wall or behind an object you don't see an aura natural 20 as they're having this conversation you glance by the fireplace the fire is crackling in there and you glance down and right underneath the hearth up where the fire's tickling you see a piece of the stonework that doesn't match the others it's slightly off-colored it looks like the burning of the fire that's been given this dark and blackened look to it there's one brick there that doesn't seem to have been affected by any of the soot at all as your finger presses against the brick it slides in about a half an inch and you hear this (click) sound over by where the metal large cabinet is yes it vanishes (cheering) okay the carpet peels back and it reveals beneath it a section of the wood that has a hinge bolted to one side of it it's a square that's cut out of it it looks like it's an open case the carpet peels back and then begins to fold back in its space and then fold up again it begins to slightly shift and rise and the carpet almost seems to be gliding in the air on its own in the vicinity it spins towards you and then rushes in your direction i need everyone to roll initiative that carpet is now gone because instead you are fighting that carpet (cheering) all righty so nott would've been over here yes roll initiative please beau you're over by the fireplace so you've just seen that happen there and i think that's-- right right i forgot my dwarf mini well no it's in here somewhere forgot to bring it out i am unprepared that's fine i'll use this i'll say that that's him there it's fine given that case guys first it's a surprise round as it whips its way over towards nott it does because it suddenly rushes in your direction that is going to be a 21 to hit natural 16 it goes and wraps around you and completely envelops you within itself all of a sudden you just see darkness and you cannot breathe currently you are enveloped by the rug of smothering initiative here top of the round 25 to 20 anybody 24 that'll be you first nott 20 to 15 beau 15 to 10 what'd you get caleb it's true nott it's your turn first you are restrained you are blinded and you are suffocating at the start of your turn you immediately take 12 points of bludgeoning damage as it's now crushing and constricting your entire body you feel the life being pulled out of you as you're gasping for breath in this space what are you going to do with your turn yes you can still talk you're (muffled sounds) you still have the breath you had in your body when it went around you so i'll say you have enough air for one spell and then that's all is that a spell attack roll yeah you would have disadvantage because you're restrained but it's also smothering you so i would give you advantage to that so it's just a straight roll that hits go ahead and roll damage good to know nope no you are restrained you can try and break free but it's an action to try but hey there you go jester you're up okay you see it wrapping around and nott's flailing about as this carpet is crushing her little body go ahead and-- yes go for it oh yeah that hits go ahead and roll damage on that okay it takes eight points of radiant damage and nott takes seven points of radiant damage as you blast you hear nott (muffled screaming) underneath you get the sense all the damage dealt to this rug is divided with whoever it's enveloping jester you going to stay where you are sorry you would've been probably over here you going to move or stay here you move around and stand on the bed all righty that ends your turn jester beau you're up that hits roll damage that's three to you nott seven damage that's four damage to the thing and you fail a death saving throw no that's on a critical she wasn't attacking nott specifically she was attacking the rug okay so you hit it twice all right and it makes a what saving throw constitution that is an 11 all right what do you want to know about it it is actually not vulnerable to anything you learned it is not vulnerable to anything now it's ulog's turn ulog who sees the rug there is going to rush over and attempt to-- i know it was the best i could find in the moment you know it's fine he rolls a two because npcs that i try and fight with can't roll shit that misses that misses to your benefit ulog tries to stab and is missing or hitting the edge of the tassels it's not even making an impact on the rug he is going to use a bonus action to disengage and head back towards where the balcony is all right so that goes ahead and ends that that brings us to the rug's turn the rug is going to go ahead and release nott and is going to attempt to completely envelop beau that's cocked that is another 16 21 you beau are now enveloped by the rug all righty that's going to go ahead and end the rug's turn actually the rug's going to go ahead because it can still move-- well it's speed is nothing nevermind well it would move her away no it's not going to do that it doesn't have enough movement to move much that brings us to the bottom caleb you're up go ahead and roll for the heal on that all righty so how much does nott heal there you go top of the round nott your turn as you come to consciousness you are still prone caleb moved around to join your side there to go ahead and apply the potion you know what go ahead and make an athletics check no you rush up and you grab it and it actually lifts you off your feet and you are now being flailed in the air as you're grabbing the edge of the rug going (screams) all right that ends your turn jester you're up okay you move up go ahead and make an athletics check 12 you grab and you're not pulled off your feet but the rug is too strong and it's not quite releasing its hold on beau beau it's your turn at the top of your turn you suffer ten points of bludgeoning damage as it's crushing your body on the inside and you cannot breathe it is your turn though you can still go what are you doing beau yeah you just have disadvantage on the attacks so it was an 11 misses it's just too tight you can't quite get any movement to hit it it's a bad space for you that ends your turn it is now ulog's go ulog is going to rush up and attempt to stab at it as he sees it wrapping around there that is a 12 that hits yeah i know it does do sneak attack damage because you guys are in the vicinity he doesn't know he's trying to help that's going to be 12 points of piercing damage so six to the rug and six to you the rug is starting to look a little torn up in places and you can see bits of beau showing through where the gashes are stabbing through it's looking fairly hurt it's the rug's turn the rug is going to attempt to shift itself and beau a little bit away this direction it can only get five feet because its speed is halved pulling you along with it and its speed is ten so nott you get an attack of opportunity if you want to take one you whip out your shortsword quickly that hits go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack if you want to sneak attack you don't have to 15 all right that's eight to the rug and seven to beau the rug is barely holding on by a thread you see it still keeps her constrained you see parts of it are fraying and falling apart the threads are dangling but it's still keeping its mass strongly and tightly around her it's still crushing her and mainly wrapped around her face so she can't see and she can't breathe that ends the rug's turn caleb you're up you're up make an athletics check there it is you're trying to pull and you get some threads that snap off and you're like shit it's not working you're not getting the right grasp on it that ends caleb's turn nott you're up no it's you and then jester yeah that hits go ahead and roll damage if you want to do it with sneak attack up to you it looks like it’s doing pretty rough it's up to you so that's five damage to beau and the rug you tear through the rug you cut through and the rug bisects but you also see that where you cut through also cut across the front of beau as her eyes roll back and she plops onto the ground the rug falling in pieces to the ground around her coming to rest okay go ahead and cast cure wounds to heal so you gather all the pieces of the rug to join your shingles it does not appear to be trapped it does appear to be locked roll again correct yeah easy enough (lock clicks) you manage to open it up and there is a small chest about that big that rests in a small cubby beneath sam and as you open the chest make a constitution saving throw okay so first there's a sudden burst of a brief light through it and all your muscles tense up and you are paralyzed ulog goes no traps and pulls it open no issue inside with ulog you see a beautiful set of burgundy and gold robes that are up hanging you see a set of polished bracers made of cobalt steel that are both dangling on a hook and you see three ancient statuettes like relics or collector's items that are arranged on the bottom of it that all look like old museum pieces are you still concentrating that's true you didn't take any damage none of them are glowing except for the cobalt bracers make a history check ten you do not unfortunately holding to the chest the chest which is now open in nott's hand no on the inside there is a faint glow if you look inside you see there's a cluster of platinum pieces they're stacked on the side and have shifted around from the movement you see a single polished river stone about that big that is giving a glowing aura and you see a few sticks of wax and a single pressed wax seal you do not see in this vicinity any letters or handwriting no marisha make a perception check you both make perception checks 18 you do glance-- good to know you glance off to the side and there is a desk in the corner that has two sets of drawers that are currently closed okay you grab it and put it in your pocket okay okay (clicking) mostly it's just blank parchment you do see a few notes that are maybe partially written letters that were crumpled up and thrown in there that are lord sutan's handwriting okay go ahead and roll for your forgery kit so roll a d20 add your proficiency modifier and your intelligence modifier i'm sorry guys sure i'll say since you were helping her that i'll give you advantage on the roll advantage on the roll so roll one more time you start making one and it's not quite working out and beau looks over your shoulder points it out you take it-- you throw it in the fireplace and incinerate that one and then make another one this one is pretty solid and it matches the writing perfectly (hissing) done in the current room there is a shelf in the hallway that you can see that has a few books no there's nothing glowing okay you guys make your way back up to the entranceway up into the crawlspace above the attic pull it closed and latch it you move the art piece back over you make your way back to the edge of the roof where you guys had exited climbing the ladder that's attached to it making your way onto the roof getting nott up there manhandled ulog following you as you get to the top you close it-- you put the shingles back in the space for that i'm going to have to have you both roll dexterity checks please or since you're helping have you roll a dexterity check with advantage because you're helping her yes 15 okay you manage to find and arrange them in a way where they aren't going to slide off and even with a bit of rain that's in there you find the pockets where they originally mostly sitting so they're not going to coast with any sort of weather shift all right you guys are noticing at this point as they're on the roof because you're paying attention you see them begin to emerge on the roof as you begin to see a cluster of crownsguard doing a pass through the street yeah there's four of them that are approaching and they're going by and keeping an eye on things okay what kind of disturbance make a deception check technically no because you weren't part of it had to catch it before the roll unfortunately that's okay (chuckles) he rolled a one the snitch isn't working for me tonight so the two of them don't seem to quite buy into it but the two of them that go well all right we'll follow lead on leads the three-- you jog along two of them continue their route keep moving along we're all right but thank you they keep walking frumpkin makes his way around (barking) again the dog unleashes a torrent of barks like no not again you hear the other guy being pulled across the yard he's being dragged through the wet grass you guys begin to make your way across who's carrying nott across make an athletics check as you try to make your way across the rope so do you want to save yourself or nott because one of you is falling as you grasp you loop nott around the rope as you lose your grip feeling it coming and you tumble down falling three stories so you take 12 points of bludgeoning damage as you crack hit the ground as you impact the two guards that were talking to you and chatting immediately whip around and see jester on the ground and put their hands on their weapons and begin rushing towards her you're on the outside of the fence yeah like just barely you just missed the wall nott is up on the rope hanging and dangling sure you tug her over onto the roof 12 damage make a deception check you should have said before the roll (groaning) right all right they drag you and start bringing you towards the gates out of the tri-spire so you two make your way-- miss you've got to sober up and you can find your way back tomorrow morning so they escort you out of the tri-spire you guys are pushed beyond the gates and there's now eight guards at each gate that are preventing any passage in and out you guys are shoved back out into the city however that distraction gives you guys enough time to get the rest of you over and down to the beyond the tree okay so you guys all get across you leaving the rope there or are you detaching it okay make a dexterity check aw gil it's about ten feet from you okay the rope does break and the grapple bends the grapple's not usable anymore you do remove the evidence but the grapple’s not usable at the moment as you guys pull yourselves away from the vicinity about 45 minutes later as you guys are collecting yourselves eventually the paralysis wears off it lasted for an hour total what are you guys doing yeah ulog pulls out a pocket watch and he looks and it and is like oh she better fucking hurry up let's go you guys make your way over towards where the high-richter's home is the two of you guys head back-- you guys are heading back to where the sewer is you're saying there is another entrance it's on the northern side could be okay you rush around through the street you make your way back to the northern gate to the district and there there is another nine or ten guards stationed with one on the top of the wall with their crossbow ready as you approach hey sorry no entry the gala is tonight make a deception check i know the rolls have been phenomenal 18 gives you both a look over all right then yeah because of-- yeah you can take a short rest you get that back so you guys get to use hit dice they do not there you go yeah you guys carefully find a space that's away and out of sight probably by one of the small fountains on the side and you all sit there and rest for a bit having drinks eventually you guys manage to catch up with the rest of the group as they're finishing their short rest you've reconvened you have your materials ulog's staring at his pocket watch again looking off at the gala in the distance is like all right if we're going to fucking do something let's do it ah and he looks off and is like i don't know fuck it let's go now i can't wait any longer no you're on the outskirts of the home and you've been here once before this wall is not an iron gate it's an actual solid tall stone and mason wall that’s pretty tight there's maybe a three-foot gap between the side of the house like three or four-foot gap from the side of the house to this the building is two stories there is the upper balcony that overlooks the whole exterior of the area before it there are the two guards at the front okay in what outfit all right what are the rest of you guys doing make a perception check with advantage because they're helping you on this one you don't see any secret entrances you don't see any other gates looks like the front door is the main way to get in or over the wall there is no one watching the back as it is a solid gate it seems like the only entrance is from the front and that's probably intentional from a defensive standpoint the wall is about-- let me check real fast this would be seven-foot you glance down a small area of wildflower and natural bushes have grown to fill the space in between where it's thigh-high there is a door in the back near the wall with a small yard maybe a ten-foot yard towards the very back area there's a small porch area with nice chair and a little reading nook there's a book left outside that looks like it got rained on and forgotten it's dried and crinkled there is a door that leads in from the back of that porch area there there are no people in the back make an athletics check sorry acrobatics for you without even touching the wall you double-flip in the air and land ever so silently you almost land on the book table causing it to knock over but you just miss it you're there quietly now there's the door across the way what are you guys doing you approach the two guards and they both look at each other make a deception check 22 they both go oh shit right in one pulls out the key unlocks the gate they open from each side as you rush through make a deception check for you as well with advantage because you're dressed as her they both go ma'am they both pull back frightened you go to the front door it's locked one of them rushes forward and unlocks it glancing out of the side of his eye towards you shaking gah opens the door and it throws open they close the door quietly behind you laura and no it is dark there is no light source on the inside right now it's low light through the vicinity you see the interior chamber that is-- it is gaudy as fuck in here you see all the walls have really intricate siding and there's inset designs that are carved into it with statues and busts of various elven figures the main chamber leads to a spiral staircase that leads to the second floor you see three busts on each side of all these different elven very regal-looking figures adorning each side you see around the side of it to the right there appears to be a dining hall with a long table (metal hitting the table) there you go to the left it looks like a kitchen vicinity and there's the spiral staircase that leads up outside of the wall where you guys are ulog's like my turn give me a lift are we not going in make an athletics check 17 you climb up over the wall and get to the very top he puts his hands up help me because i helped put this together i want to be here i want to make sure this happens understand she might have paperwork up there that could absolve my wife make a persuasion check he gives you a nice solid look and goes understood and then leaps up onto the wall and off the other side landing next to nott he glances up sees you gone and leaps he barely crests the top he's a nimble dwarf make an investigation check make it with advantage as you glance about the space you can see the statues that are facing each other on each side it looks like the dust on the pedestal is brushed off in an arc like they are often rotated because you rolled a natural 20 you notice that the dust that's grinding is from the sliding of the statues and they all seem to slide towards the stairs if you look where the dust is on them there's a slight outcropping on each of them and the position appears like they have been moved many times away-- they're facing each other-- to look toward the stairs as you do that they both (stone grinding) and you hear this (click) sound the first two they shift over towards that matching the space where the dust had shifted and you hear a slight click or release sound there's three sets of these so you do one then the other you do it together all three of them shift and with each one you hear a click and release you guys are in the backyard are you doing anything the three of you are back there with the lock the back door is locked make an investigation check if you'd like sam and i know look at this the back door is locked it is not trapped you go and get the tools in there and it gets stuck oh so now you need my help perfect yeah that'll do it he goes ahead and takes them from you and then (click) gets it pulls them out gently hands them back to you like ghost-style he does so but he does so begrudgingly he's like (grumbles) he pulls away and quickly gets it and hands them back to you here you go ugh opens the door you guys hear the slight creaking of a doorway down in the second floor as you're ascending the stairs you glance inside it does not appear anything in the vicinity-- it's a dining room you can see the opposite side of a long table with chairs make a perception check no you heard a door down below you heard them enter from elsewhere in the building but you just heard a (creak) what yes (meows) jumps down into the back and goes and catches up to you you glance inside nothing magical catches your attention in the chamber yes make a stealth check you as you begin to set up busking one of the other guards wandering by comes by kicks your cards a bit and goes hey hey move along no street busking too late gala's on i said piss off keep moving he sits there and watches you do it okay what did you roll for stealth you walk around as you're casing the joint as you're watching you keep an eye on the two guards to the front the two guards are looking out and one of them makes eye contact with you and as you walk he watches you walk and you realize that moment that you've been noticed you're being watched from a distance no most everybody's at the gala right now you can see in the distance you can see the party's still going on the music's still playing from the distance there's still drinking and revelry muffled in the distance the din of the crowd giving this low (distant cheering) he's not following you he's just watching you as you walk so you're going to try and move out of his eyesight you move out of his eyesight perception check nothing seems to catch your eye no one following you you guys you heard the creak from downstairs what are you doing you head to the top floor investigation check both of you you guys what are you doing there's a long dining room table with chairs set up it leads out into a foyer area you get to the second floor there's a small landing and a singular door the door does not appear to be locked or trapped as you guys head through the dining area into the main foyer you see there is the hallway that leads into the kitchen the staircase that spirals upward and these statues that are all facing towards the stairs the statues give off a magical glow and you hear the sound of a (creak) upstairs a door slowly creaking open as you guys look into the chamber as the door swings open you see a darkened bedroom equally gaudy as the rest of the house you can see along the walls there are portraits of men human different ages that are all lining it you can there's a small chamber an archway that leads into a washroom you can see an ivory basin that's barely visible from the little bit the moonlight that's coming through a gable window on the opposite side of the chamber it protrudes a bit arcs then ends there in the center of where that gable window is there's-- a roller desk the front has been rolled shut there's a door on each side of the gable window that leads to the balcony that you saw before that looks over everything it's a giant glass window that looks out over the city it has a beautiful view of the tri-spires and the gala in the distance you can see the light emanating over the dark night sky there is a large bed and floor itself is covered in tiger and animal skins as a means of decor in the space the walls themselves are a faint gray-blue velvet texture it's terrible that's what you have in front of you right you guys all head up the stairs together as a group perception check on both your guys' points five okay you guys keep an eye out in the vicinity nothing seems to pique your interest again okay good to know all right you guys check around there are no traps in the vicinity you do as you approach the roller desk it is locked there is like an actual keyhole and there is something that is meant to unlock the desk yeah and ulog-- you guys all come up to the landing and you can see the door inside nothing magical in the vicinity other than what you guys have on yourselves okay make an investigation check reaching around the desk there's no tricks no trips no buttons or anything you're looking through the bed make an investigation check nice reaching underneath you find a hard object a binding and you pull-- it's a book you slowly pull it out and take a look at it no it's a familiar leather tome that was an illegal story that was previously presented to you in a smut bookstore that had been hidden in the cushions of the bed it has a place marker about two thirds of the way through ulog at this point is looking about the room as well he rushes over to the desk where you are and he goes don't worry i got this he's going to go ahead and attempt to pick the lock on that yeah you guys have all caught up you're in the room now as you glance through there is a faint magical essence that begins to appear from the desk as ulog (click) opens it it slides open and you see a faint glow from a small case about that large sitting on the desk that's fine he starts-- no he's going through paperwork he's grabbing books and he's starting to thumb through-- yeah go ahead and place the letter in there there is no fireplace in this room you don't see a wastebasket necessarily no there's a small almost like a pot of some kind that is set next to the desk that looks like it might be used as a receptacle occasionally that would be evocation make an intelligence check 18 while the shape is not familiar to you the size and the length of it you've seen these type of cases before they're usually used to contain important rolled pieces of parchment specifically those that need to be protected from the elements because they contain enchantments on them this is a scroll case ulog is going through papers frantically and like searching through he's going to make an investigation check there looks like a space there it's a table it doesn't have a drawer or anything it's just a table you can hide something on or put something underneath a faint bit there's like a candle and a small piece of clockwork okay at that point ulog goes-- right there's another thing that you see there there is a small box that is wrapped in silver cord that is resting on the desk on top of a stack of books not at the moment everything that you've seen yes there are giant gable windows you have the most beautiful view of the city make a perception check yes okay well first off ulog at this point is going through and he goes i found it he's reading through and he's like frantically going through the words that fucking bitch he starts reading out loud as you're glancing over he says these are the notes on illiana's case saying that she wanted to show that even the most unassuming dwarf can be a cutthroat she admits that she was innocent but did it anyway just to set an example he takes it and folds it oh yeah we can he holds it in his hand as you glance over to the side you can see the front gate (creak) open sorry you see it close (clink) you hear the sound you guys hear this as well though you were trying to keep an eye over there you totally found yourself spacing a bit and didn't notice something shifting towards the door okay is it all set out the back door all right you guys all heading outside make a perception-- hold on make a perception check make a sleight of hand check that's what this is for you were eight you notice him go for it you guys are all watching this from the landing as you all slowly come to rest and look back and caleb as you walk out you stop at the landing next to ulog and beau-- oh sorry you're not there you stop next to ulog as right there at the bottom of the stairs looking up you see in a very beautiful elegant dark green dress the high-richter prucine hmm my my i'm glad i forgot my gift or i would have missed you reprobates breaking and entering the home of a high-richter i believe that carries a life sentence in the umber dungeon wouldn't you say if i might ask what are you looking for you have my curiosity piqued there's a brief pause as you're all glancing down ulog holds up the paper in his hand and he goes you you put my wife in chains and you know she's innocent we got proof now it's over for you she chuckles and scoffs as she falls onto her back leg and how do you plan to deliver it curious you think my home won't be swarming with guards in a few minutes she pulls a brass bell out from under her pouch and rings it outside-- it's such a fast moment if you didn't have anything prepared it happens too quickly you're like ah and the bell rings you stump sucker i'll bleed over the extra years of your sentence into your wife's that way you can both rot together on opposite sides of the dungeon ulog looks at you all like absolute fury and sadness in his eyes you see like tears down his cheek he goes and takes the paper in his hand and puts it in your arm caleb making eye contact with you and goes promise me you'll see her freed friend on her all righty natural 20 she resists it she goes what are you trying-- and ulog goes (roars) grabs towards his neck and runs leaps off the stairs towards her and attempts to tackle her you watch-- yeah he goes and (boof) she falls onto the ground and onto the landing of the spiral staircase they both slide a moment you watch as she goes what are you-- and he grabs and pulls that orange-ish bead that he had on his necklace and slams it into her mouth and holds it over there's a moment of tension before-- (explosion) a flash of white fiery burning light explodes a fireball sundering the interior of the staircase you all have your ears ringing the pain's there the ones that are closest by would have been you caleb i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw please that's a failure thankfully a shitty roll for you that is 21 points of fire damage caleb goes unconscious onto the ground as you guys all come to in the moment you look down at the middle of the staircase the walls are blackened the staircase is currently in the process of burning and down you see the twisted gnarled corpses of both ulog and the high-richter prucine you hear (boom) as you head down the stairway you can see the front door being hit from the opposite side you guys watch this flash of light the glass windows shatter outward from the balcony the two guards at the bottom go uh they quickly throw open the gate and are now currently slamming themselves trying to barricade into the door okay as you guys are rushing make a perception check okay as you guys are rushing you suddenly hear this very loud high-pitched whine sound you're like (pained sound) it causes your head to-- and you especially glance over as you begin to surmise the direction you look past and you can see the tri-spires there in the direction you see the mighty zauber spire of the halls of erudition there in the distance and you see there this growing black spherical mass beginning to emerge from the side of the lower third of the tower you watch as it expands the whining gets louder and louder you hear this crack sound as the black sphere suddenly folds into nothing and where it was you see all the stone that made that part of the tower collapse crush and then stumble the tower begins to slowly shift as you hear in the distance screams echoing around the music stops the attention of the guards suddenly shift over from the banging door to the tower crumbling you watch as the tower-- suddenly there's a flash of blue light and the tower stops you see a brief shift of a force field on the bottom that holds it in place partially collapsed you see two figures take off from the top you see two other figures leap out of the hole from where the explosion weird black sphere was at the base of it and leap down about 35-40 feet below the tree line you see the two figures begin coasting flying through the air in the direction where they were as bolts of energy start arcing out of their hands towards where those two other figures fell the screams are getting louder now and you can see now the guards are starting to rush out of the various street corners you guys are rushing around-- you were rushing towards the back and then slowed as this started happening it's distracting you you guys start hearing this cacophony outside as you rush through the back door you get to the back wall what are you doing you get that door open you guys start rushing out there you heal up caleb you come to consciousness being dragged your feet grinding well the windows are shattered the explosion-- make an acrobatics check followed by a stealth check well you reduce the damage you take by one die so you only take two points of bludgeoning damage as you land your ankle twists and you tumble and roll and get up what's your stealth check using the chaos that way and the guards that are now out in the middle of the street you land behind them one of them goes to turn in your direction and you dart behind the wall leap over the side and arc around to meet the rest of the party as you all slowly begin to climb over the back wall where beau and molly are waiting for you running to the sewers everyone make a stealth check as you're trying to make your way through there people are now starting to run back to their homes you can see people running and screaming now dressed in full attire for the gala leaving their masks behind screaming bloody murder okay i know that's okay so a couple of bad rolls but for the most part you guys averaged okay thankfully with the chaos and the way you are dressed you manage to push through and mingle well it wasn't too hard you make your way through the town you can see the tower still being held in place and the two figures that you saw gliding before as this is happening and you're rushing through you see a few other bolts hit a large bolt of lightning grind down in the distance before eventually they both begin to peer over and are now looking up and down the streets as you make your way back towards the alley over by where the gala is you see a shadowed figure dart out from behind and a bolt of lightning strike there's a detonation of burned ozone as the figure falls to the ground smoking as you walk over to the figure you see one of the flying entities floating down you can see now this robed mage figure with a staff in hand wearing a large ornamental mantle long grayish hair is now gliding down in the direction of the dark figure of the ground male yeah you guys see this as you come around-- the age roughly from this distance from what you can see its later older age 70s human if human but you can't quite get the details it starts shouting one has fallen find the other and coasts back off doing a pass looking through the various streets well the guards have rushed forwards and grabbed the body and are now dragging it back towards the tower make a perception check aw 18 all you can see is the cloak the cloak is blocking most of the body you see a hand behind that's like a leather gauntlet except for fingers exposed the fingers appear to be-- the glove or design of it are almost like they were dipped in blue like there's some sort of a blue tipped glove as its dragged back that's all the details you can make out unfortunately as it's being pulled away off the street the guards are now swarming people are trying to get back to their houses people are swarming the gate out of the tri-spire and the guards are trying to hold them back calm them down and it’s nearing a riot at this point you guys make your way over to the edge of the sewers begin to look around for a moment where nobody's watching and one by one make your way down into the darkness closing it behind you as you all get down into the quiet of the underground there's a moment where you can hear the distant muffling of movement footsteps making their way back and forth across the alleyway other yells and screams information in the distance far too far away for you to make out the details of what's being said what do you do caleb at this point you glance down and you're still clutching in your fingers-- no the paper that ulog left behind are you guys making your way back you're heading back through the sewers the direction you came okay barely sneaking away from the insanity of the district you walk through the darkened sewers down the same familiar path that you walked to make your exit coming up on one of the false junctions where the left side of it is partially collapsed but the right side continues to where the t-section is beauregard caleb and molly and jester because you guys all have the higher passive perceptions you begin to notice this area where there's no water that drains down the centre groove of this part you see spatters of liquid well there's no light in here currently dancing lights open up the area here as you hit the intersection you see it is dark and red it is spatters of blood and as you glance up right there at the intersection you see a figure one hand against the wall breathing heavily you glance towards it and take a moment as the light globes are now shifting out to light the space you see a humanoid figure seemingly male in outline adorned in jet black almost insect-like leather armour that protrudes in large sweeping hooks at the joints - the elbow joints the shoulders a helmet that's form-fit black leather and onyx studs wraps around their head it looks demonic the brow plate sweeping backwards into rear facing horns their other hand is dangling clutching a cannonball-sized twelve-sided dodecahedron shape about that big that has a handle on each side it's emitting a dull undulating grey glow as you cast armor of agathys on yourself the figure which you now see is the source of the blood looks heavily wounded and is breathing heavily the lights now up its head (creaks) turns towards you and you hear a voice say (guttural speech) does anybody here speak undercommon what are the components of that one as you begin to make the incantation the figure pulls their hand away and draws this horrible gnarly-looking hooked blade from the sheath and goes (snarls) and rushes in towards you and that's where we're going to pick up next week (yelling) always trust the porn there were a few chances for you guys to see high-richter prucine arriving but you kept rolling low perception on the outside-- --and i was like “all right she's going to get the drop on you guys” there were so many different ways that could've gone but it made for an interesting story aw man guys that was awesome well done they don't trust people that don't look trustworthy like you molly
