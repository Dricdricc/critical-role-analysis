jumping in-- apparently that's my intro music hey i'm glad i have one at least thank you  i've heard stories from friends and such but i've only done one escape room challenge  that was a lot of fun if possible  not that i don't believe in your ability but-- yes please yeah well done oh boy okay uh-- my first thoughts walking into that room were okay this is my bailiwick  this is my realm of expertise tarot cards over here as well gift of flight-- these are different potions possibly i cannot imagine that all of these are gonna be useful that's what we're trying to see here so we have-- there are a lot of spells there's a spellbook there's the little sheets of paper that have spells on them for now let's put these out here yeah we got numbers as well hey guys we're pushing the 20 minutes  we reached a point where we had been running around floundering  we found a lot of pieces to things that we didn't quite know how they fit together we're floundering a little bit here do we want to go ahead and try and  at least get a helping hand to maybe get on the right path knowing that we could continue to do this for next 15 minutes if we aren't careful  i think we all began to realize that it's best to just use this helping hand now the cards should go in the slots based on the order they are so d-- yeah correct i've drawn these that is a a i'll take half of it here death got it oh right here it says-- eth topnoi fo sncseipua awesome a-u-p-i-e-s-c-n-s makes a lot of sense a-u-p-i-e-s-c-n-s we immediately had to just shout out the letters and try and figure out  what the actual phrasing was hopefully those are the letters that are there gain might to wrench from stone-- we find this list of ingredients to make a potion how about this the sorrow of a fiery beast and essence of a spider's feast let's see drops of water undead's bane so holy water i'm glad that matt is here because he's really good at interpreting  what a lot of these sentences even mean see if you can find holy water deep blackened sea night's stain there we go mind of beast lacking haste a slow creature sloth brain perfect and a touch of something sweet for taste sugar that should work yeah acridness to curl the tongue-- acridness to curl the tongue castor oil could work actually the finishing touch must be sung where's the funny bone dust yeah mix a little bit in each one funny bone that one there we have the funny bone the dragon's breath just went in  we have the spider's feast now which would be the-- uh ink is next the deep blackened sea night's stain  so put the ink in mind of beast lacking haste the sloth brain touch of something sweet for taste i don't see anything else that looks sweet it's the sorrow of a fiery beast you don't see like dragon's tears or anything acridness to curl the tongue acid-y bitter awful to the taste  apparently it means acidic hey brilliant hornclump juice and pus yeah y'know what let's go ahead and add the acromantula whatever it is to there  just fuck it it's supposed to give us strength the finishing touch must be sung hornclump juice and pus yeah y'know what let's go ahead and add the acromantula whatever it is to there  just fuck it it's supposed to give us strength the finishing touch must be sung oh sung we have vocal cords-- i saw something here that was-- thank you for someone to get the might if no one's gonna do it i'm gonna fucking do it  i'm watching matt drink this and i'm like i don't know if you're supposed to drink this all right probably well we'll see if it works or not see if it'll allow it no i think the thing that went wrong with this potion is um-- i have no idea it might be the acridness i think we used maybe the wrong ingredient one of the wrong ingredients  maybe it was that acrid thing adding vinegar to it oh that's terrifying --by mixing dust of funny bone the sorrow of a fiery beast  the essence of a spider's feast drops of water (undead's bane)  deep black and [jenga] stain holy water oh here we go i got it i got it for the holy water sorry  it's part of the spells for it that's-- i'm so dumb for not seeing that  to change water into something blessed is a simple task do not feel pressed  simply raise the bottle to a light and chant-- where do we have light  oh there of course it's matt who figures out that you have to bless the holy water benedictus aquaticus we shall see i want matt to be my priest all the time there you go going to add a little bit of the ink here as well sloth brains that's going to be the peppermint vinegar no we have to put the ground vocal cords in there all right mix that up  oh that is disgusting we're pretty sure we put all the pieces together for this potion  we've got the holy water functional for us  [matt offscreen] but something isn't working still no matter how hard we try and redo it it's not working  thankfully marisha finds a note ♪ i take responsibility for this failure ♪ i will say that for all the dread and disappointment i was feeling in myself  through all that puzzle-- it has-- uh the sword doesn't say anything i had to start wandering around the room searching little things that  maybe haven't been discovered yet ah-ha we got a wand and a scroll okay okay it looks like it's upside down i know we're in trouble we don't have a lot of time there's another scroll here --that tells us that we have to cast a spell with the wand that we found  good times looking for a magical amulet yes a magic amulet [chris offscreen] bonus puzzle is just these scrambled-up words and then there are all these little glyphs that you had to interpret oh is this the amulet yes the amulet we got it invertum illuminates for each moment of this there's that little pause and hoping that something happens  and more often than not it doesn't and you get kind of sad okay so each of these corresponds to one of these runes i turn around and there's like disco lights on the wall and so much has happened  matt's wearing an amulet and i don't even have a clue of what's happened  in the last five minutes so what do those correspond to what order should they be in the compass and the w with the line so it's five [matt offscreen] we get all these pieces and we put them on the table in the proper sections  where the roman numerals on the wall said that they were supposed to be placed-- the bell  once again that awkward tense moment hits and i hear that click once per soul chant the spell until the evil sounds its death knell  do we have a banishing spell in here fuck yeah chris i mean i think i pretty much saved the game hats off to him man he has proven himself to be a very important member of this team  in spite of his own thoughts read them all together it's this one here okay to banish evil conjoined be arranged in banded geometry once per soul  chant the spell-- we all have to do it in order so you did it now marisha go and we all start saying the spell dimisisti inimicum meum in tenebras exteriores and nothing okay banded geometry i would imagine be putting them together but-- conjoined be arranged in banded geometry oh do we need to repair this evil's not that bad yeah [laughs] worth it yeah i was you know i'm happy we got as far as we did [nerdy voice] to be fair dungeons and dragons rules even just moving water can be dangerous  to certain undead so um just putting that out there
