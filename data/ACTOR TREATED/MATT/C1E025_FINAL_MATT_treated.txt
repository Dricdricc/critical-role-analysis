involved and what you've helped continue to promote and help grow so look forward to that at the break it's going to be good does anyone have anything else they want to announce i couldn't tell if he was blushing before or after you revealed you were sitting on his face it's hard to tell yeah probably he's pretty cute there you go all righty we're waiting on our esteemed gnome bard to arrive due to traffic and when he does we have a little present for him which we will reveal when he arrives but in the meantime let's go ahead and kick things off for tonight's episode of critical role and welcome back (laughter) it's pretty good we started doing burpees in between no i mean we just burp bring in the gnome i would like the gnome brought before me i appreciate that you brought it back no it's a reminder yay (cheering) however we do have a present for you because there have been periods of time in which you've complained about not having a proper stein or mug to match the rest of the group we figure-- google one works fine but thanks to some of our wondrous illustrious campmates we were with at burning man they gifted this unto us to gift unto you as we felt it was fitting and size-appropriate well done all righty so to get caught up on what has transpired the party after traveling abroad in the distant city of vasselheim and the surrounding lands eventually returned to emon their central hub city where they had their greyskull keep constructed to relax and take in a brief moment of respite before learning that the briarwoods two individuals responsible for much darkness and sadness in the history of percy were coming to court in a week to feast and talk with sovereign uriel tal'dorei what are you doing you got to keep pouring upon hearing of the briarwoods' arrival within a week to discuss political matters and enjoy a feast of course the members of vox machina who are part of the council in tal'dorei were invited within that week they made their various preparations made the various beard checks made the various beard shavings it happened and made their way to the central palace at the cloudtop district of emon the briarwoods arrived a feast was put out however percy went in under an illusion to look like vax over here while vax went invisible everyone had formal attire on weapons left at the door unarmored dressed for the occasion yeah you guys were all dressed in formal attire so your weapons are at the door they're not on you at the moment yeah as part of the check-in process yeah because you went invisible and you were under the approval of seeker asum correct the list is on him his pepperbox bad news would be a bit difficult for you to bring in here yeah i think so during the feast conversations were had questions were raised and information was extracted seeker asum had requested to have been met in the foyer by our rogue here who forgot and then decided to go on his own upstairs following the briarwoods to the second floor where their guest room was set he distracted one of the guards with his serpent belt knocked out the other entered the room and found himself face to face with the briarwoods themselves yeah it went right into their guest room so after a brief discussion a little bit of awkwardness you attempted to leave but were placed in a holding pattern by a hold person spell and had the two briarwoods come up to you whisper in your ear that you had nothing to worry about you look delicious you guys are just now leaving the feast hall at this period of time a large foyer area there's the main foyer of the palace that splits off to two smaller meeting chambers and the chamber to the right is what leads to the grand hall that's where you guys were feasting so you're making your way into this-- asum seeker asum yes no the spell itself would dissipate as it is a concentration spell it would be a oh spell's gone however before we get to you guys we have more immediate business to attend to vax your muscles lock in place sweat beginning to bead down the front of your forehead the realization of the immediate danger you put yourself in washing over you you can see across the way in the dark candlelit area of the room by the canopy bed is lady delilah briarwood hand still out smiling at you immediately to your left shoulder is lord sylas briarwood who has leaned in he's actually pulling you away from the door now you're skidding across the ground (dragging sound) as he shifts you your legs unable to actually move as he pulls you forward the lord whispers in your ear you are a curious one though not quite gifted with the silver tongue foolhardiness is not becoming of a guest of the briarwoods for a moment there's this pause this tension the silence and delilah lady briarwood puts her hand out further and says yet my love we are not here to make enemies nor raise suspicion we are merely protecting ourselves from intrusion isn't that right as she looks at you and looks immediately to your right where you can feel the general presence of lord briarwood i need you to go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw you feel your muscles lax and the sweat that is still brimming across your face you feel for the first time in these moments that seem to stretch on forever you have control of your body though you do feel the hand of lord briarwood right on your shoulder who as you become conscious of the fact that you are in control of your physical form his voice comes very heavily the bass kicking into your left ear indeed we do require allies i would have you prove friendship and as he takes and moves the shoulder away you find your torso moving towards him you lock eyes with him and he has this knowing grin his lids taut slightly with this condescending sense of knowing i need you to go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw this is technically a charm effect and you being a half-elf you do i believe get advantage on those 21 you feel an extension of the sheer unnatural force of charisma that attempts to penetrate beyond the usual slippery mind that vax holds to such a high esteem however you manage to resist it and feel it wash over you as the slight tingling vanishes and the effect has left you unaffected by whatever he was attempting to try there's a brief moment as he looks you over there now be a good boy looks over i need you to make a deception check now you used a couple luck points last time deception yes 15 okay gives you a look very well apparently the help was not very helpful at which point you hear this fast knock at the door and you hear a voice go are you all right is everyone all right behind the door at which point lady briarwood just does this with her finger and the door swings open (creak) on its own the guard that ran after your belt is standing there holding the groggy just slightly coming to second guard that you knocked out and as he pulls him towards the door he looks over and sees this and he goes drops him and goes for his weapon and lord briarwood puts his hand up and goes do not worry we're just having a conversation close the door and get him up yes not a worry sir and he closes the door and you hear the scuffling behind the wood of him adjusting and waking up the guard who you had clobbered in the side of the head getting him to consciousness so they're both just looking you over lord briarwood's just walking back and forth keeping a very keen eye he walks between you and the door as you stand there almost like he's waiting for a reaction of some kind for you to initiate something you hear a throaty chuckle from lady briarwood across the way (chuckles) no but what do you think my love lord briarwood comes up from behind his hands on the back of your shoulder and says like we said you haven't the gift of the silver tongue but i applaud your effort lady briarwood at this point steps a couple steps closer she's still about 15 feet from you he's right behind you right between you and the door she steps forward and looks over at her husband again and goes what do you think can we trust him and lord briarwood leans forward and you can feel his chin peeking into your peripheral vision i'm afraid not it seems-- into him he's between you and the door as you go to move away his arms that are on your shoulder tighten flex and hold you in place since i don't know what you're going to say i'm going to say persuasion for this because i don't know if it's a deception or not you want an inspiration (laughs) what are you asking for what are you begging from the dm no i'll give inspiration when you've goddamn earned it as you say that looking at them with this coy look of information about uriel they both chuckle in unison (chuckles) shall we and she gives a nod and goes i think we shall we're now rolling for initiative so here you are right there lord briarwood is behind you lady briarwood is over here by the edge of the bed these are the two windows this is the layout of the room here as far as you are aware there are two guards outside the door currently oh no one adjacent is what you're telling me all right so for this delilah steps forward and you can see there's a slight flash of bluish-purple arcane energy in her eyes and her fingers coalesce around as she does she draws her fingers up and you feel this sudden cold pressure around your body i need to pull out my spells i don't know what i'm doing here all right so i need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw vax 19 all right so as she does this you feel all the flesh on your torso and around the neck part of your body all of a sudden begin to dry and crack as if your life force itself is beginning to wither and be drawn out it's the equivalent of a plant drying out and dying very fast but it's your flesh instead you go ahead and take-- you take 21 points of necrotic damage and she's going to go ahead and step this way after that she backs up and grabs the edge of the post at the side of the bed and looks at you with this grin at that point as you tense from the pain sylas immediately whips to one side and with an unarmed claw attack a giant fist is going to hit you on the side of your torso that is going to be a 21 to hit all right you take eight points of bludgeoning damage as his fist socks you on the inside of your chest area hitting the sternum and you feel like a slight pain crack sound as it hits and impacts against the leather as you pull forward with unnatural speed (whoosh) the hands are back on your shoulder and you hear this little voice say bon appetit that is going to be a 25 to hit all right okay you take six points of piercing damage as suddenly you feel two extremely sharp warm prongs jut into the side of your neck and that same cold sensation you felt across your torso all of a sudden begins to pull from the neck and you feel as if the very warm blood around your throat begins to drain from it you take an additional 12 points of necrotic damage and your maximum hit points are currently reduced by 12 it's your turn actually this will be part of his unarmed attack no he does not have you grappled currently he's over the shoulders there are two windows on each side of the room there (window breaking) as you run past you can see there's this moment where it's almost like they are letting it happen there is no momentary aggression or frustration to this as you dart and (crashing) out the window falling from the second story go ahead and make an acrobatics check okay (chuckles) you hit the ground with a tumble and you get up and you continue to move forward so at this point you've pushed into the courtyard now you can see the cobblestone road that surrounds the outskirts of the palace there are a few bits of light and you can see there is the carriage they came in horses still attached and the younger man who led them inside who was driving the coach is napping on the front who is now looking over spooked at the sound of shattering glass as it clatters onto the ground around you and that ends your turn everyone else you hear jenga whispered through those of you who have the earrings on not from this part of the palace you're too far away that's about as much as you got out this combat round because it was a very quick series it took all your effort to even get out of that situation so you guys go forward you run towards the front and the weapons are being held in this storage area off to the side that is used for storing weaponry and armor for people who arrive and shouldn't be wearing them in very social events so you guys head that way you're getting a big drink you burst through the hall and head up the way as you do you can see some of the other servants glance around suddenly as you you're gliding up the staircase and onto the second floor there are two servants one darts out of the way we'll let it go so as you coast up releasing your avian payload on the stairs you can see looking jarred and confused a human woman brown hair freckles mousy-looking servant looks up and reaches up as you spatter the side of her shoulder okay the keyleth spatter vanishes through arcane means however the servant begins to give chase up the stairs after you guys not angrily just following to see where the action is going all right you head over to meet up with them to grab your weaponry although your weapon was probably on you so you go ahead and grab bad news and pull it off the side that's your guys' action now so as you are out front lady briarwood is going to right at the window looks down for a second and i need you to make another wisdom saving throw 13 so as you get up and you say jenga a familiar feel comes over you as your muscles once again lock into place and you fall over from the momentum of the run going face-down into the cold dew-covered grass in this courtyard area unable to move in a similar dash fashion and leaping out of the broken window that you left lord briarwood (impact) onto the ground next to you three-point landing stands up over you with this grin that will be his turn though at this point in time one of the bookcases-- you hear this sound real fast this sound of wood being slammed open and a surprised noise that's all you hear from your perspective in the distance all right so as you guys get your weapons you begin going where where you saw them leave you head up the stairway following behind where you saw keyleth and tiberius rush off to are you following the rest of them seeker asum with message i believe the person has to be within visual range wait no you can cast through solid objects if you're familiar with the target and nobody on the barrier it's 120 foot though you don't know how far he is you could give it a shot the message is delivered out into the space hopefully it found its recipient yes lady vex right away runs off you guys coast up the stairs right as you reach the top of the hallway over here you can see there are two guards that are currently standing at the door the door is currently closed but you're in eagle form so you're going to be doing like eagles do i'll say you're about there because you were a little bit ahead of them those are the two guards right there at this point now as this is happening i need you guys to go ahead and roll initiative and keyleth keyleth you got ten you said okay so after that current circumstance that brings us-- as they're rushing up you would be finishing off the last round so you can make another wisdom check okay you can just see the little bit of moonlight up in the sky it is this ominous image of not knowing if your friends are coming not knowing what's happening all you know is you cannot move your physical form and looming over you is lord briarwood standing and beginning to move in to kneel that will end your turn all right that brings us to the top of the round this will bring us to lady delilah who is now going to step out of the glass leap down try to catch herself and falls flat on her ass smacks down (grunts) gets herself up from the ground yeah she has to use the rest of her movement getting back up from prone at that point she's right there but you see now in the window above her a small humanoid figure a familiar one that was waiting for you earlier in the foyer who apparently was hiding inside one of the dressers inside the room he's there lady briarwood is going to take the rest of her turn she has one action left with this she looks over to you and says when we mark a target he does not escape i'm afraid i'm going to see what this does all right i need you to make another constitution saving throw you take 34 points of necrotic damage you go unconscious then when it comes back to your next turn you have to make a death saving throw if you fail three-- you are unconscious nope go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw with that thought cast out the darkness swallows your vision and unconsciousness takes you into the cold wet grass on the floor of the courtyard surrounding the palace a small shiver runs down your spine vex a feeling you haven't felt before a feeling of sudden and immediate sourceless dread and in that instant you know that there is almost no time yeah she is actually at this point beyond the palace walls you can sense and knowing the palace walls you were expecting a second floor it's that direction but just outside the walls of the palace and you guys just got your weapons i'm going to have people who haven't rolled initiative yet go ahead and roll initiative so i can put you on the timing chart here grog 17 nice 17 look at you guys you guys are coming up into the hallway at this point let's see all right vex and grog you rush out into the courtyard area making your way out of the front some of the guards can see you dart out and they go to stop you but they see you going where they're going they recognize you and let you pass so that will be for scanlan grog and vex'ahlia your turn is making your way around the outside using a full run action you haven't crested the outside of the palace yet you don't see anything but you are starting to make your way around the corner do you have your ear pieces on then yeah you would okay go ahead and make an intelligence check roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier eight so you manage to dimension door-- as opposed to being directly outside because you haven't seen this part of the palace you're not really 100% visual range you haven't visited this side you end up trying to come over in this area you end up appearing right up here inside the room looking at the window and you can see down suddenly you look about this room to the left of you is seeker asum who doesn't even notice you are there he is currently putting away a crossbow looking out the glass window you can see down with the little bit of light that's in the courtyard you see lord sylas briarwood looming over what looks to be the currently unconscious body of vax'ildan yes it is bringing us to this point now that's your guys' turn tiberius you're up right there all right go ahead and roll damage yeah they did not make their saving throws so roll your damage on that 35 okay one of them gets blasted and thrown almost off his feet and pushed back from the sheer force five foot in that direction the one that's this side of the doorway who was already at one hit point barely brought from already being knocked unconscious by vax you hear a scream and is turned to ash his charred armor left clattering across the ground both doors are blown open from the force of the explosion a large portion of the room is currently singed with black what's your fly speed that's as far as you can get he can currently see you yeah okay make an intimidation check liam laura and from what you can see the helmet itself guards part of the face but you can see from the charred slightly angered gritting expression on his mouth as he looks at you as you shout that the grittiness goes away the jaw opens slack and takes two instinctual steps back into the hallway does not appear to be interested in threatening what just blew his friend into ashes from behind you as you're flying over you see this servant come rushing up the female one that you saw earlier on the stairway rushing forward seemingly with an intense look of what went from curiosity to now engrossed in this current circumstance kit do you want to go ahead and take your place trinket would not be at the dinner per se trinket would probably be kept somewhere near the stables where the people can watch over your animals not in the middle of the grand hall of the palace of tal'dorei sorry as you rush in you see this giant fireball blast through the middle of the hallway two of the guards are sent off to the side there's this hurried look and this shout you've seen these individuals throughout the palace before and they're part of the council you've always kept a distance from them you're a servant of the palace you want to keep up appearances for many reasons however there's this rush of energy and this general sense of dread in this corner of the palace and for the most part judging by this you didn't like the briarwoods when they arrived and you think things are going wrong here what are you going to do with your turn you're right over here in the hallway it's hard to see from this perspective here but you're right over here this is kit buss who's our official artist for critical role (cheering) you're over here there's this guard here and these doorways are blown open and seems to be where all the energy's going you have a good sense for the flow of energy and emotional tension and right now everything is pushing in that direction that'll get you right there you can just look past the doors and they're blown open that'll be your turn there as you glance inside you can see the gnome member of vox machina is there currently at the edge of one window the left window is shattered on this side seeker asum another part of the council is right at that he looks over his shoulder looks at you and goes shoo you see him look like what are you doing no go go stupid servant that's your turn all right that brings us to percy you were rushing outside with them or rushing up the stairs okay you'll just catch up with them they're on the outskirts just cresting around the side of the palace here all right you're in theory off the map on this side i'll get to that shortly you're rushing as fast as you can you exited the front of the palace and spent your whole turn rushing as fast as you can around the side it's a long distance putting all your energy into it you have no visual unfortunately that brings us to sylas all right no sorry before sylas is the seeker seeker asum asum he's pretty awesome he's going to leap down here he's going to make his own acrobatics check which he does with flying colors because rangers are cool like that lands immediately and angrily rushes forward going no and attempts to feint into an attack and lord briarwood puts up his hand to attempt to deflect with preternatural speed just (whoosh) out of the way asum instead reaches down to grab the unconscious body of vax and is going to attempt to move you away from here sylas does get an attack of opportunity against you that's a 16 what's your armor class 17 unconscious i'll say there's no dex bonus to that because you can't move out of the way so that would be 15 i'm sorry 12 it hits you i rolled for that you immediately take a death saving throw instantaneously you failed one now it is sylas's turn that was seeker asum now it's-- he got a free attack because he moved out of range to try to hit him rushes up to join the fray there he's going to look towards seeker asum and say this quarrel is not with you asum looks over his shoulder asum relaxes his grip on vax's body and stands at attention and you hear him say my apologies i did not mean to meddle he seems to be stepping out of the fray yes that's a charm action to get him out of that that will be sylas' turn that brings us to keyleth make a general dexterity check you're flying in very tight quarters as a giant eagle flowing through 12 okay that's fine you clip a wing it hurts and you wince at the impact but you manage to make your way in there as you come down you grab scanlan but there's not a lot of room here to get much lift or air so you're now clutching your gnome do you not want to be grabbed by her make an insight check five okay you see this giant eagle come screeching into the room talons out and starts coming at you with talons be mindful of that it's technically now a grapple contest so go ahead and make an athletics check it would be strength 19 go ahead and make an acrobatics check to avoid it or athletics athletics or acrobatics your choice 15 as much as you try and fight the eagle grabs you and your tiny gnome form is grasped in its claws oh woe is this evening all right that finishes keyleth's turn i need you to make a second death saving throw okay so you stabilize you didn't die sorry my apologies vex you swing around the corner just getting to the outskirts you're not sure where trinket is do you want to get as close as possible to the fray i'd say as you turn the corner that will get you about there and you can see now there is seeker asum and lord briarwood both standing over what looks to be a small cluster of cloth the source of the dread you can yeah no that would just hit her oh within ten feet it would hit seeker and sylas yeah okay go for it roll for it the fury pumps through your veins in an attempt at vengeance at what appears to be your twin brother at death's door you pull the arrow from the back of your quiver as you feel the energy gather from the atmosphere around you while the energy itself is a blue crackling energy you see it as bright vibrant crimson red you release it with a scream towards lady briarwood go ahead and roll damage on that yes times two all right he doesn't get one right so it does additional damage one okay the lightning hits her it shocks her and you see the pain come through but for the sheer force that should have been it seems almost like it wasn't as impactful as it should have been however lord briarwood and seeker asum both fail so they both take the additional damage sure i'll allow it you've certainly invoked the fury tonight all right go ahead against lady briarwood to follow up on that well no she's not concentrating because he's unconscious i was saving for the hold person spell but she's not concentrating on that currently she is actually lit on fire no it has to be damage from the allies of the person who charmed them so no you guys are currently considered a threat to him all right so that ends your turn that brings us to delilah delilah who's now on fire laura the blazing bowstring does that ignite her does she take continuous fire damage or is that just one-time fire damage no it's an additional 1d10 once she shrugs off the flames i remember that angrily as the electrical energy and the flames dissipate she puts her hands out like this and she looks at you for a second and she extends one cruel finger towards you with a look of intense hatred i need you to make a constitution save i don't know if she has to aim it or not let me check nope i need you to make a constitution saving throw 17 that's not enough unfortunately you take 66 points of necrotic damage as a sickly beam of black energy streaks out from her finger plows into your torso and you feel as if your soul is temporarily pulled from a portion of your body for a second there your eyes glance past the threshold of death and you manage to pull yourself back in the cold resonates through the rest of your body and all of a sudden the temperature outside which was already pretty chilly feels freezing cold brush with the finger of death all right she is going to move over towards sylas right here getting into a protective standpoint glancing down at the unconscious body of vax that brings us to-- we have grog tiberius and scanlan you've figured this out now after this whole (yelps) keyleth of course you can see through the window right there yeah it's hard at this point what's the range on healing word he is not close enough to reach you'll have to move first you would know the range of it you'd be like ugh he's too far okay all right tiberius okay 60 feet flying speed good to know that's as far as you can get right there that's the 60 feet for your movement right from an elevated standpoint you would probably just barely be able to see the edge of lord briarwood down there below he would have three-quarters cover but you can see him no not from the angle of the window okay all right you can use your action to move if you want to get closer to the window or you could go outside if you wanted to this would be the end of your turn regardless right there yeah you can see him there cool so you're floating in the air currently looking through the cracked window at the cluster of mayhem that's below that ends tiberius's turn grog it's all happening simultaneously okay what's the range on it here's what we'll do it's the warhammer or war pick i know it's the distance of the weapon is what it is looking it up right now for you i don't have a player's handbook if somebody could look up the equipment section right now excuse the sound change here as i have to move the mic there we go i got it there is a range on thrown weapons unfortunately warhammer this one is not considered an actual normally thrown weapon so i would give it the same distance of a handaxe which is 60-foot max but you would be at disadvantage on the throw anyway pretty heavy disadvantage on this so we'll give it a shot no as you lob-- yeah if you know the distance then i'll say sure sure against her okay she glances over at you as you come running around the corner this giant engine of muscle and death you growl at her screaming-- what's the dc on it 13 she glances over at you and you see her head turn to the side with a curious chuckle yeah sorry all right kit you're up oh that's right you're doing your turn continue yes it would all right so roll for how much you heal him it's an additional 1d4 for each so it would be 5d4 plus five yes you do kit you're on deck so imagine what you're going to do next five so you heal 17 hit points from the darkness-- no it's plus five consciousness comes to you breath comes into your chest and you can feel the cold wet grass against the left side of your face your vision begins to clarify for a second and you look up over you you can see immediately to the right of you both lord and lady briarwood standing over you looking down with one half of their gaze the other paying attention to-- they're looking down at you and glancing at this slowly encroaching circle of assailants that was your bonus action so what's the dc on that with that okay good to know what are you suggesting to her all right and what saving throw is it is it a wisdom saving throw wisdom okay good to know rolled an 18 she has advantage on it anyway all right yeah she rolled a natural 18 plus her wisdom bonus of two that puts her at a 20 she just crested over it you can see she glances up for a second at you the presence of the actual shouting and the suggestion echoing through the glass and out the other broken window she looks up and you see parts of the shards of the glass are actually shaking from your singing the harmonic resonance of the glass catching your-- you gather that probably at all given points of time she probably enjoys being close to her husband but not overcome with an uncontrollable urge right all right so that ends scanlan kit you are but they're not currently in visual range because they're outside and down below so if you want to try and move over this way you can try to get a visual you would have to leap up onto the edge of the canopy bed you can just see them past the broken window down into the courtyard there as tiberius the dragonborn you saw coast through is hovering in the air about five feet above you all righty what is the dc on the spell it should be at the very top of your spell sheet 17 all right against lord briarwood (chuckles) even with his plus seven-- he is going to use his legendary resistance to succeed the saving throw so as you do that you see the magical energy form around his head and this crown of darkened arcane energy forms and begins to clasp around and he looks up for a second and shrugs his hair like that and it (crash) dissipates and you can see for a brief second his vision come up and find your gaze i understand as it was a concentration spell also the illusion that you currently were holding fades away what was once the demure mousy-looking human guest suddenly appears as a pale white tiefling currently now existing at the edge of the bed her image shimmers and disappears as you see her standing before you on her hoofed legs holding what was previously a non-visible staff in one hand you are right above her yeah looking over your shoulder you're a little bit in front of her but yeah you see her all right so that will be your turn there percy following suit you begin to move around the corner to the others you are now within visual range of both briarwoods-- at a far distance though-- too far for the pepperbox no its range is 150 so yeah nah they're within range for both against who yeah that'll hit okay the first shot as you (gunshot) the shot echoing out across the night sky of emon lord briarwood who is currently staring down at you as you come to consciousness and you can see under his breath he says oh there's no way out tonight friend and begins to lean forward before (impact) the back of his shoulder is wracked by a sudden impact you see dark material just (spray) spatter out with some sort of dark crimson and he (grunts) looks over his shoulder with anger and you can see at that point glistening across the moonlight the sharpened fangs visible at the edge of his mouth as he looks over-- okay so you use your second attack to reload 24 to hit will hit okay that was using the arm shot good so as he turns around and glares at you there's like a moment of clarity and you can feel that familiar stare that horrible glare and the cowardice in you fights the moment of tension that you've been waiting for this sequence as you load the weapon he says it loudly enough for you to hear but this voice now you see lord briarwood says would you look at that dear the pup yet lives (chuckles gunshot) (laughter) it's as far as you can get you still have your heroic action if you wanted to do that holding onto it okay all right so that will end your turn seeker is then going to turn this way step towards the side and pull his crossbow out it was already loaded with a bolt into it and he's going to take a shot at grog who's currently the biggest target right now that's going to be-- rolled a two that's going to be a 13 against armor class yeah goes and for the bonus action reloads and gets the second shot at you that will be a 19 all right you take seven points of piercing damage halved because of your rage and with the rest of his movement seeker asum's going to go ahead and step back in the shadow beside there ending that turn now it comes to lord briarwood keyleth you're up after him yeah you're coming up don't worry you guys rolled the lowest initiatives he's still prone yeah so sylas is going to seeing the circumstance reach down and attempt to grab you he has disadvantage because of that (laughs) all right that's going to be a total of 11 to attempt to grapple you yeah you don't have to yeah so it missed entirely all right so that's with his first strike second one he's going to go for another attempted grapple on you with disadvantage that comes to 18 for hitting you all right and now he's going to make an athletics check to attempt to grapple you that is going to be a 13 you could yes go ahead and roll a d10 d10 and subtract that from his attack modifier okay with that as he reaches down in an attempt to grapple you and grab you by the throat the fingers are coming towards you and you try and attempt to roll out of the way all of sudden you hear distraction and lord briarwood's (annoyed sigh) you see his massive eyeroll and then goes in for the attack but that's given you enough time to roll out of the way his hand only meets the ground he's then going to step back and get adjacent to lady briarwood that ends his turn keyleth you're up out the broken one over here or the non-broken one okay so you're coasting over here okay so as you swoop down and leave scanlan right there in front of them that'll be there you have no idea you just swooped out there and he's there like hiding in the shadow you didn't see it though from your perspective there you just saw a bolt go yeah you do yes that was just your movement as you swooped down right there okay you've already used your movement to get there and drop him off and go all the way around yeah you used your full movement to get there and drop off scanlan okay keyleth all of a sudden the eagle condenses down and forms back into keyleth in her half-elven form okay 17 points of healing and with that vax you are prone on the ground half your movement yeah you could probably do that yeah okay and what's your full movement then it would be 30 times two which would be 60 half that so you can run 30 feet because it takes half your movement to get up so yeah you disengage there you go all right that ends your turn at the top is vex superior would be 8d4 plus eight yeah you would be scooting right over scanlan's head with your arrow it would say on the spell 15 would not hit unfortunately so as she stands there grinning looking over all this they're both amused by this whole circumstance there isn't really a glimmer of fear as the first arrow comes by she leans to the side just dodges it a little bit the second one comes towards her and lord briarwood deflects it out from in front of her and gives you a look of like don't you dare touch my woman trinket is somewhere you whistle again okay that's your turn yes indeed you are as she looks at you for a second and there's this sparkle this prismatic glow of light in her eyes i need you-- hold on all right so you're going to attempt to counter let's do this go ahead and roll a d20 add five yeah that's not going to do it at that point all of a sudden you feel a surge of arcane energy suddenly burst not visually but on this coursing connection almost like two nexus points of energy there's this tidal wave of arcane energy that blasts into your mind i need you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw 18 18 would unfortunately not succeed yeah you take 21 points of psychic damage-- and your intelligence and charisma scores become one suddenly language leaves you all the spells the nature of spellcasting is robbed and you know where you are but everything is instinctual from this point you are essentially from a communication standpoint a giant lizard at this point actually yeah you do because you can only maintain concentration and you land on the ground she then steps-- you don't know tiberius it's your turn at the end of every 30 days which is what she would be saying if she was knowing this was happening to you so anyway you still know your friends you know you have friends here you know there's something to protect you know that people need protection you must protect and that's the extent of where your drive is right now it's hard to say you're still you you're still present there you just know that suddenly spells i don't know spells (growls) anger frustration protect it's all base instincts right now you don't know and he goes (scared noises) right and takes another five foot step back from you unexpected feral reaction from tiberius yeah i moved you double okay that ends your turn grog you can't get all the way there but you can get within throwing range all right so now you (whoosh) lob it the flames arcing in a circle towards him 23 hits go ahead and roll damage 17 all right so (smash) the hammer hits him in the front the flames burst from the impact you can hear the metal clang of metal against the armor he's wearing under his outfit all right you did 18 damage then good to know all right so go ahead and if you want to try and retract it's a bonus action you pull in the chain it whips back like thor you catch it mid-air prepare yourself for the next round that'll be your turn scanlan you're now there face to face you are essentially the shield of the group between the briarwoods all right you go to release the spell she immediately begins to mutter something in between you immediately feel this counteractive arcane energy if she hadn't rolled a natural one on her counterspell that would've been pretty bad but through the sheer force of frustration and anger at this point now the lightning bolt presses through her counter and the bolt is released in that direction arcing towards both of them she rolled a one to try and counter your spell 8d6 and for their saving throws-- yeah it would hit them both no he's off to the left all right so they do both make their saving throw so they both take half damage 32 okay that's a 16 to sylas and eight to lady delilah apparently both of them (impact sounds) take the blast from the-- and you see this look of okay things are getting a little weird now they both look at each other with a realizing they're now a front of two against many swarming individuals do you want to move or stay where you are you have not oh no you did you flew past as you went and you were like what the heck is that and then you pulled out unfortunately no all right so that ends your turn that brings us to you so are you staying at the edge of the bed or are you going towards the window to have a clear view all right so you leap off the side of the bed come up to the edge of the broken window looking down towards it all right let's try and make this wisdom saving throw chose to make his save using his legendary resistance remember the target still becomes frightened for the duration so now as you do this and look up lord briarwood has had this cocky grin the whole time sees this sudden albino tiefling in the window glare down and send this shimmering wave of arcane energy hissing from above the echo of the hiss hits lord briarwood and for the first time you see him recoil in strange momentary terror and seems to almost step back into the side of his wife glances over his shoulder towards her and she gives him a look of misunderstanding and acknowledgement so he cannot get near you currently cannot get any closer to you and has disadvantage against anything against you just her all right very cool so that's your turn on that one percy no the moment you fired the illusion dissipated okay go for it yeah that hits all right so you've shot reload shot and this turn-- oh so bad news is empty that's the first shot you got this cool sorry i misunderstood all right so this is the first shot second shot 25 hits all righty all right 18 does not hit the first shot (impact) off the shoulder and the second one (impact) hits the same point where bad news hit the arm blasting off another portion of the flesh and the third one this time you can actually see the shadows coalesce around him and the shot just misses through the darkness and reforms into the physical form of sylas as you're finishing your turn that you can see sylas' flesh is reforming and healing rapidly from the damage he's taken the actual tendons are forming back up from the blast damage he's looking at you with a slight grin but then nervously back at the tiefling in the window back and forth at this point in time asum is going to go ahead and back up this way and is going to use an action to hide rolls a three terrible absolutely useless all right so sylas now is going to angrily look around and pulls off from the back you can see this shimmer as there was an illusion dissipates and what previously looked like it was an empty back a large scabbard appears pulling this giant dark slate-gray greatsword from the back and lunges forward towards you grog you have not seen uriel no all right is going to then make a strike at you that's a 26 to hit all right you take 12 points of slashing damage reduced to six and i need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw no you just have a high constitution 18 all right you feel like the actual wound from the blade is attempting to draw some force from your body but you just (grunts) and flex and whatever arcane enchantment is resisted turns around for a second swipe that is going to be a 19 hits all right you take 15 points of slashing damage half that to seven or be eight round up for use so eight and make another constitution saving throw yeah once again there's some sort of enchantment that's trying to pull from the wounds as it hits you and you just grin them off with this chuckle so he's going to use the rest of his movement to step back a little bit you get an attack of opportunity yes you do with the hammer 24 hits go ahead and roll damage okay 15 cool that ends his turn keyleth right there all righty a 40-foot radius this way you mean so sleet storm (boom) right in that area right there so as you slam the ground the ice begins to move around and all of a sudden the cold air begins to form this almost like mist as the temperature shift suddenly impacts the surrounding vicinity the grass freezes in place and you can see bits of ice and sleet begin to rain down in the vicinity good to know cool all righty so that ends your turn vax all right go for it no the additional action is not so much a potion greater healing is 4d4 plus four yeah all right that ends your turn vex you're up you can try and shoot either if you want to move over to the side and get a better view on him okay okay go for it 28 does hit go ahead and roll damage for the arrow and you do an additional 2d6 radiant damage to lord briarwood 2d6 radiant damage okay good to know so as the arrow impacts (impact sound) he puts up his cloak to guard in time as it goes (whooshing) through the cloak you hear this (grunts) in pain as the arrow bursts and as the cloak comes back you can see this burning sensation across the front of lord briarwood where the flesh was healing and sewing itself up that has been halted immediately by the impact of the holy water which is beginning to pockmark and burn his flesh yes that'll hit that's your second holy arrow right nice second one (impact) shatters and you can see now like part of the jaw is hurt and wounded (panting) there's this wild frenzy to his face as you can see lord briarwood is starting to look a little ragged all right that ends your turn lady delilah briarwood steps forward up to the back of her husband she does and against the spell 'cause it's magic she gets advantage that would be an 18 what's the dc right but it's against your dc of your spell so yeah she makes it so she steps forward almost slips but catches herself on the shoulder of her husband and says my dear i fear it's time that we make our leave casts dimension door both of them (whoosh) out of visible range on him yes you sense that they're not that far from you they're around the corner where you guys came from as you guys rush around the corner you can see on the very edge of the cobblestone walkway the carriage that they came in is now gaining speed-- 27 hits go ahead and roll damage 20 points of damage all right the wheel splinters and (grinding sound) is now coasting on the ground the young gentleman who is currently on the top is looking over his shoulder trying desperately to usher them away right now they're about a hundred feet-- trinket was over at the stables on the far back of the palace unfortunately can you just shift it over there oh well no it's concentration to keep it in the area so you're casting sleet storm again what's the range on it 150 feet the sleet storm lands down the cobblestone becomes sleek the carriage begins rocking back and forth however it does manage to keep on its course currently it does not get knocked prone it's hard to knock a carriage prone but it is sliding out of the way good call actually that is a two (cheering) from a visual standpoint you're about 60 to 70 feet from the front of this the doors slam open and you can see lord and lady briarwood step out hold on as you've guys are just turning the corner you can see now lord briarwood stands up and is trying to compose himself ruffles himself up angrily looking at his damaged circumstance lady briarwood's against his shoulder and she goes (clicks tongue) well (sighs) at the very least i think you should come visit us sometime percy you're always welcome back home it'd be nice of you to visit your family once in a while roll initiative just you as you were the first action to take 19 go ahead and roll roll the attack for the exploding arrow this is against lady briarwood yeah 29'll hit yeah roll for your-- so 16 regular arrow damage okay against lady briarwood cool all right and then for the additional blast that blows up it's additional 4d6 blast damage to her and they both get saving throws to try and halve it so half damage to both of them 11 so half that six damage to each she needs to make a concentration check advantage on that for war caster yeah that's a 19 okay so (explosion) a portion of the outside of the carriage just blows apart wood shrapnel goes flying to each other side as the smoke settles and the explosion you can see both lord and lady briarwood are still standing there seemingly unscathed by the event she wraps her arms around him and whispers in his ear it's all right and they both (whoosh) vanish in a swirl of arcane energy you don't recognize it because right now you don't have the intelligence to really-- you walk over to the carriage driver who is currently on the ground this young man who's horribly hurt part of his torso is burned and he's like (coughs grunts) trying to climb away (gasping) please please spare my life please what do you want from me (labored breathing) about what (gunshot screams) it's an easy enough hit he's prone before you three of his fingers are blown off and the bloody stumps (gasps grunts) shaking (panting) i'm sorry i don't-- look--  i am you don't know what it's like i had no choice please don't please the rest of you are gathered and you step out from the edge of the window and make your way with the rest of the crowd and they're watching this display on the front of the palace yes he's gone he's gone sir i'm sorry they're all gone sir they all-- i don't know i don't-- your family is gone sir they were taken they were killed i'm sorry they'll find me sir they'll kill me and with that we're going to go to break (yelling) welcome back guys couple of quick things before we jump into this one we are 38 subs from our next giveaway giveaway is for those who are active in chat get a signed photo of the cast of critical role as well as a signed piece of art wonderful piece of art from our kit buss who's right here with us it's pretty awesome it's a wonderful piece of art of keyleth transforming into an earth elemental and attacking k'varn in the k'varn fight so yeah we have that coming up also we have the winner of our shirt giveaway tonight the winner is one blair beverage (cheering) i was so scared so as you all begin to gather around on the front of the courtyard of the palace you can see some of the guards start rushing out amongst the splinters of this carriage that has been royally destroyed by many of you yeah you get the sense that there is no immediate danger okay you guys currently are too engrossed with percy currently pinning a young boy on the ground and shooting his hand off he's currently like please what do you need just let me go please okay 21 at the point of life he has left (whack) yeah he just (impact) falls and crumples to the ground unconscious pool of blood forming there are guards coming now from the palace well not from the head but he is missing three fingers from one hand and is currently pooling okay so taking care of that he's unconscious you guys all take a moment to breathe in and realize the danger that just transpired the briarwoods got away god knows where they're off to you gather somewhere back in their territory on their own turf and you all look about at the guards gathering making questions and there are now two guards very intensely harrying this tiefling that showed up out of nowhere and began aiding the battle you see now one guard has an arm going to your shoulder and says you what's your name what's your business here you do not have approval to be here at the palace i think we would notice a tiefling in our midst you're under arrest throw her in the cell the guard gives you a look and says as far as we know right now you both all of you attacked two of our guests in the center of our own palace they managed to flee we're going to investigate this currently we're holding no one at immediate prison sentence for this but-- make an intimidation check you do get a d6 inspiration dice well if you already have scanlan's then that's all you need all right the guard looks at you for a second then steps away i mean no offense understand we've had-- he relinquishes the hand on the side of the tiefling and says we're going to investigate this i mean no disrespect to you you've been much aid to emon just understand this is a very peculiar circumstance please we'll call you when it's time to get your opinions and your perspectives on the evening's events we need to go ahead and notify-- at this point you can see now tiberius you've stepped up in front of the stairs as allura comes rushing out to inspect everything and sees you you can't even form language thoughts you can give him an emotion that's the most you can get to him right now tell her what emotion okay she steps forward and says tiberius-- and you just breathe flame out and allura steps back for a second tiberius are you all right you've been cursed by something hold on she takes your head and holds you in place to calm you down tiberius calm yourself and begins to inspect you running her fingers up the side of your snout and like this is not good this is very powerful magic i don't know if i have capability of doing this really you need a cleric please sit tight stay right here the rest of you as the guards back away you're left alone and the rest of the group are looking upon you in a curious way you can make a medicine check sure percy go ahead and roll an investigation check okay yeah there are definitely two puncture wounds on the side of his neck most everything that would be of interest has been destroyed in the sheer force of the explosion the carriage is in tatters there's not much you can really glean from it unfortunately time of night right now it's probably cresting close to 1000 or 1100pm i mean (laughs) the temple is always there per se i mean there are multiple temples in the city as well the sarenrae temple is the one you know best at this point as you guys are discussing and you're already nervous that you're out in the open anyway you're not under one of your various guises you feel this warm bolt of heat in your upper torso area and you guys watch as suddenly across the front of her chest this strange glowing red eye-like sigil (flame noises) emblazons across the front and then slowly fades you guys watch her visual image shimmer back into that of a servant and even through the illusion there is still this dull pulsating red glowing arcane mark of an eye that's slowly shimmering on the front of her torso a voice rings out suddenly from behind you towards the palace all of you stop your business and you look and you see there in his robes uriel which you summoned standing at the front of the palace am i to understand there has been a scuffle with my guests you see now on the front steps sitting there next to allura who's cradling him as he's unsure of what is happening you do yes uriel looks and says i'm certain there is some sort of explanation for this we will investigate look the briarwoods are esteemed guests of ours and friends so this is going to be taken very seriously then we shall have to have a conversation for the time being take care of this one tomorrow when the sun rises find yourself back to the palace i would very much like to speak with you this disturbs me you have as have they all right go ahead and make a persuasion roll very well calm yourself calm yourself take care of her we'll talk tomorrow bring me what proof you have this is a very very serious thing you're discussing you guys gather up-- okay you guys leap onto the back of keyleth as she rides off allura takes tiberius takes you by the elbow and leads you over the rest of the group as they ride off if you are indeed going to a cleric perhaps you should take tiberius with you he's not well seeker asum currently is nowhere near this situation all that are present because many are now riding away on a horse (laughs) but the rest of them get a fine licking you all manage to make you way up to the temple of sarenrae the lantern light of the interior of the temple's main structure is low as it is late in the evening nevertheless the gates are always open and as you enter you are greeted by two clerics that are dressed in long flowing yellow and gold robes and there is one elderly cleric that you recall the one that led the resurrection ritual on pike not but almost a year ago actually the two younger clerics step away as the older one steps forward he's balding on top this long straggly white gray hair that crests-- there does appear to be arcane residue on this one yes we could hope to cleanse him of this come enter light the lanterns and the clerics all start turning up various lanterns and the magical light source of it as soon as you enter the temple a cold ripple sensation begins to curl on the back of your neck as you step in as you do step in too the two clerics give you a look and are uncomfortable with the presence and as it has you guys through your travels you have encountered very few tieflings let alone on this continent in fact most you have met were in vasselheim this one in emon stands out like a sore thumb and everyone seems to be just a little put off by her presence that's right never mind i retract that entire sequence as she comes out of this feverish daydream none of that happened (laughter) illusions all right so as you guys enter the center of the chamber he begins burning various incenses as you step up the cleric says understand these services are intensive in the costs required to present them to you (chuckles) the cleric oh no that-- that's that's very-- he says for this one we require a donation to the temple of sarenrae of a hundred gold pieces he steps forward and touches the side of your head on your temple and begins to focus the symbol of sarenrae begins to glow on the front of his clavicle and suddenly you can see these strange gray veins that had wrapped around the sides of tiberius's head retract dissipate then fade as intelligence swells back into your brain and for the first time in at least the past half an hour or so you are back to being tiberius stormwind okay as you bring vax forward the cleric leans forward what is wrong with this one oh the good news is if you're standing here then most of the danger is gone however there might be some residual of the infection he leans forward and inspects it for a second reaches into his pouch and pulls out some herbs and presses them into it it burns a little bit make a nature check this is glissfoil glissfoil is used by many medicinal practitioners as a means of burning away infections and cleansing wounds as he presses in he looks to you as long as this doesn't get infected it should be all right i assume based on what you say the nature of these wounds that is some sort of-- vampirism from what i know of vampirism it requires many tastes of your life force and bringing you to the threshold of death and beyond to truly turn you unless this is some unnatural thing beyond classic vampirism you should be fine certainly he reaches into a pouch and pulls out a handful of glissfoil it's like a dried yellowish green leaf that curls in itself a little bit and gives it to you there are rituals but they take some time if you'd like to leave it here we could make use of this and bless the contents of it yes unfortunately it doesn't work that way but should you require such blessing we would be happy to oblige for that amount there two days for this volume-- he looks at it for a second and says this is an enchanted vial is it not i'm curious to see how this will interact with the enchantment we'll try we'll put it at a 25 gold donation for the two days of enchantment thank you well is there anything else i can do to help you this evening that was a simple disinfection there's no price for that we're happy to heal here pike trickfoot this deep smile brings his face from this deep melancholy tentativeness to this warmth you hadn't seen before and he goes i had not known that our lady had reach as far as vasselheim (offscreen thud) it appears you've messed yourself i'm happy to hear that she has continued carrying her faith to distant lands and that she has recovered well since our last meeting good make a persuasion check he goes gilmore i think i've seen that shop around me and the clerics might have to go see it then good to know appreciate that nevertheless sleep calls to me i must get back to-- well good night and adieu to you all tristan of course he steps back the lights dim on the inside of the temple as you exit you guys step out into the cold night air on the streets of emon you look back at this point and you see as you guys are reaching the outer wall of emon (galloping noise) behind you (happy bear noises) rubs up against you (moans) licks the side of your face (sloppy bear noises) roll an attack go ahead and roll a d4 divided by two two plus your strength modifier which i believe is four so you take six points of backhand bludgeoning damage as grog (whacking) the echo from the impact as you guys are having this discussion a voice rings out behind you and says don't worry it's not going to help you no you turn around and look and you can see a gentleman standing there about 25 feet away from you you see dark brown and black studded leather armor with a cloak over one shoulder standing straight with a grin deep dark red skin burning yellow eyes and jet black slicked hair between two horns that jut back a tiefling stands there looking forward with two individuals flanking from side to side that are slowly stepping-- the tiefling the male tiefling steps up forward and says i've no quarrel with any of you we've been scouring this city for a fugitive for a number of weeks and as luck would have it you guys happened to smoke her out of her hole okay you guys are walking from the outside of the wall to your keep right now they are coming from emon you guys are in this in-between section between your keep-- you are yes and we're going to go ahead and have you guys roll initiative keyleth started this right casting spells generally for most people is a bad idea all right so from a visual perspective here stoneskin's up on you anti-life shell who is where all righty trinket is over this side here the prisoner was brought to your keep by the guards yes you guys would be up that way all right as you look at this point you notice the two individuals to the left there is a sickly-looking older woman with dark verdant clothing that flows and drags behind her to the right is a shirtless humanoid with darker scarred skin very muscular shirtless torso wearing a white featureless mask over the face and they both curl to the sides the initiative was what's the initiative order here so who got 25 to 20 all righty 20 and 20 for you as well all right okay 20 to 15 19 nice grog what did you get 18 15 to ten 13 all righty percy what'd you say keyleth you got 11 all right is that everybody cool we're good so as you (crash) how big is the radius of the anti-life shell not technically grog because grog would be up front right there so a ten-foot radius around you and what does it do anti-life shell the top of the round the broker goes rolled a very high initiative high dex character yep sweet lillith you've been a very bad girl nefertiri nethspira and bellenore would all like to have a word with you they've paid quite a bit of sum and proven legally you need to be taken back now to your friends here it's your choice the easy way or the hard way choice is made and with that (whoosh) he vanishes from sight that ends his turn there was a casting yes all right go ahead and roll a d20 all right it's a spell oh no it just fails you don't have to roll for this one this is invisibility so as he goes to vanish you oh as a reaction pull out your counterspell and his image shimmers and then returns oh that's not even fair very good well he's then going to use his move action to shift over this way to there all right that ends him lillith you're up if you'd like to yeah all right against which one all righty so he's going to go ahead and make his wisdom saving throw what's your dc all right go ahead and roll 4d10 psychic damage this is blending in because the spell usually triggers on the start of his next turn this is you both going at the same time and conjoining your minor illusion fear into hitting him with this spell and working it's this combination of everything hitting at once all right and as that hits you see he looks at you and his expression goes from glee to terror and he's immediately reconsidering his decision here do you want to stay where you are or do you want to move all right that ends your turn vex you're up tiberius you're up at the same time we'll go with vex first all right trinket (galloping sounds) rolls forward and (bear rolling sounds) both of them try to move out of the way they both get their dex save all right so broker manages to pull out of the way just in time however the other the big thicker character doesn't quite have the dexterity to shift out of the way and takes the full impact okay he suffers 14 points of bludgeoning damage as trinket tears through he is knocked prone that's trinket's attack for how that works for you and your bear because that's his attack this turn well that's his attack it's been a while since you attacked with trinket once right you can make one attack yourself while commanding it so you get one weapon attack as trinket goes by since it didn't hit him he gets an attack of opportunity on trinket does hit trinket does take seven points of slashing damage from the broker as he misses him and he hits as he goes by he rolled a 21 to hit 26 against the broker all right go for it all right the broker's going to make a concentration check maintains concentration all right as the arrow (whooshing) moves out of the way hits the armor and splinters past not dealing any physical damage but you see the broker is now visibly shaken by the two members of the party and sweat is starting to bead his confidence he strolled into is quickly failing all right that ends vex's turn tiberius grog's in the way you can barely see here right there it would hit both of them and not hit trinket okay so they both have disadvantage on their saving throws okay cool as you arc around the side you release the one single beam of flashing red energy sparks at the end of the finger lobs forward (explosion) with a gargantuan explosion red flames swirl into the area sending the whole area the dark part of the night open field alight you see all the green dried grass is immediately burnt to a black crisp go ahead and roll damage what's the dc yeah they both fail with disadvantage full damage you can only use one metamagic option on a spell when you cast it oh interesting good to know thank you for the heads up that's cool i like that 46 as the explosion bursts forth the flames dissipate you can see the broker there looking angry frightened immediately takes some of the flame okay you vanish behind her and as he pulls back the flames and then releases them they snake between everyone and go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw it is fire damage oh okay good thank you for the heads up on that so you take half damage the angry tiefling hits you with a hellish rebuke it would be seven damage you take half damage from fire so that would be four fire damage as you take the hellish rebuke's burst of flaming dark arcane energy and (gulps) swallow it and take it in you blow it out the side of your nostrils and it burns but damn does it look cool scanlan you're up over here on this side yeah all right so it's a wisdom saving throw on her end what's the dc on that is it 19 okay so no that does not make it so what're you choosing so she turns around she's holding this gnarled wand in her hand as she comes around she gives you this strange look and goes what and falls unconscious on the ground asleep you take a d10 inspiration dice it makes you laugh it's less of an attraction thing and more of a oh gnomes they're so small all right that ends your turn grog you're up yeah you can get there all right so that's five foot wide so it'll hit him and one of these or her and one of these two guys it hits something in a five-foot line so you pull it out and as you throw it downward the javelin goes from a metallic blade into a bolt of arcing electric energy that slams downward penelope does not-- not penelope you keep shouting it at me the old woman on the ground gets no saving throw because she's unconscious and she takes double damage so 4d6 the javelin arcs through and goes towards there and then he does make his dexterity saving throw against that he's a pretty dexterous guy right so it takes a little bit of damage which was what was it you rolled was it a 14 so it takes seven points of lightning damage for that and then make a ranged attack on the actual javelin oh sorry that was against the target so since he was the target he takes the impact the lightning bolt arcs through the old woman she (screams) shakes awake screaming as the bolt arcs upward from the ground and right before it goes toward the broker as he rears back in fear it solidifies into the javelin as it once again slams into the front of his torso he's like (grunting gasping) he pulls it out shakes it for a second looking at it confused the guy gets up and only has a half move on half movement yeah runs up to you as he does so you can see holding on his side gets up and goes bolting towards you arcing around the side anti-life shell the anti-life shell does-- it was a ten-foot radius you said okay so he's unable to just runs forward hits the barrier skids past hold his place there instead then however has a spear still rushes around with it both hands on it arcing towards you with it that is going to be-- well that's okay it rolled a three to hit plus eight that's going to be an 11 so no it just (whiffing) it swings wide with the spear this is going very poorly for them all right vax it's your turn now all right 18 against the broker just barely hits all right that does hit yeah constitution he is going to fail that all right so you're staying where you are all right percy you're up okay so right there the broker you see has like a shortsword out he's currently tossing it and catching it or he's tossing it and catching it but like (grunts) he's having a bad day the broker was not prepared for vox machina that's to the broker 16 points that is doubling the dice the broker can't do anything it already used its reaction 19 hits that that was five shots well all in all it was six shots but five hits yeah that's okay (chuckles) first and foremost how do you want to do this (cheering) i feel bad for him (laughter) (booming gasping coughing) make an intimidation check with advantage with a d6 inspiration dice okay standing there smoking giant hole tombstone style in the center of his chest there would be no dripping except for the cauterization of the heat round that exploded in his chest and is a blackened cinderous tube where once there was a chest cavity the broker (death rattle thud) falls onto his back with a smoldering spiral of black smoke pouring forth from the chest wound on the ground as you stare at the other two screaming that out you can see the old woman who's still on the ground (panicked gasps) looks extremely out of place and freaked out the masked individual from what you can tell behind the eyes of the mask does not seem emotionally affected by this it may there is a slight vibration that ends your turn all right the old woman gets up and is like (panicked gasps) as a bonus action casts misty step and appearing 30 feet over here no because misty step happens she stands up and vanishes in a swirl of vapor she appears a little ways away in the field and immediately (mumbles a spell) you would be able to because it has been your turn you would have your reaction back so yes you could so go ahead and roll a d20 (laughs) so she (mumbles a spell gasps) (laughter) tries to run away the slippery wet grass she slips a little bit as she's trying to get away now that ends her turn keyleth you're up all right the broker's not getting a turn lillith you're up you can begin using it because it's a one-minute casting time you have to get closer because you're probably a ways away we'll say from there you begin concentrating on animate dead as you begin pulling through and speaking in guttural tones that have multiple layers of tonality and volume it's this weird symphony of discordant voices as she begins to speak you can see now the smoking ruined body of the broker begins to shift and twitch on its own so that'll conclude your turn lillith vex and tiberius you guys are up okay the big guy yeah that definitely hits all right good to know and so as you pull back the arrow and release it there is that-- the way that you constructed it there's just this pouch of very thick gooey-- is this the spell or is it the actual arrow constructed by percy right the one that he built so what happens is that the front of the arrow it doesn't do any actual damage on the impact instead what it does is it when it smacks into it there's a pouch in the front that detonates from the impact and sends this very quick-setting tar like glue substance that just spatters across the body and lower torso it expands like a foam there's no damage on that one but it's currently (grunts) grappled by it and cannot move from its place okay go for it roll for an attack what did you roll heh it's funny-- mages don't have a lot of armor even with mage armor you manage to hit her square in the back go ahead and roll damage she goes (cries out) and stumbles and catches herself and gets back up and you can see the arrow sticking straight up out of her back probably four inches into the back of her shoulder blade trinket growls (growls menacingly) she goes (terrified shriek) and yelps out as the giant bear-- when we get to her turn i'm saving it what's trinket's movement actually i have it here trinket's movement is 40 feet okay that's as far as trinket can get right there i have a little trinket cheat sheet okay scanlan you're up the guy in the mask is currently grappled his lower body is currently held in this weird tar-like substance he's like (grunts) trying to break free you just choose somebody else to do it to yeah let me see if you can for another creature but can't target a creature again-- oh if it succeeded on a saving throw you're right so she can so what do you want to do oh that's right sorry about that so he waits for you to finish but he can hold his turn yeah she's within range and what're you doing that is a 17 nope (panicked breathing) falls asleep on the ground with the arrow (arrow twang) right out of the back and you acquiesce to tiberius it's your go all right d10 inspiration die tiberius it's your go he's taken quite a bit of damage all right tiberius what're you doing she's currently asleep on the ground this guy's like (grunts) nope she's just out of the range okay as you do it catches itself spinning in the air up ahead of you (spinning) this strange vibrating high-pitched whine sound as the blades are spinning in rapid circular motion okay go ahead and roll a spell attack roll yeah it's also a critical hit because she's currently asleep so it's an auto-crit so go ahead and roll 5d4 a d4 for each dagger on the spinning blade spinning at high speed plus five or 5d4 times two plus five yep so just roll 5d4 and then multiply everything by two so 26 plus five is 31 points of damage the unconscious woman face down on the ground the blade tears through and grinds a large wedge out of her back spraying a bit of gore across the nearby grass thankfully she was asleep so she probably didn't feel it it was so fast but she is definitively gone i'll say for the sake of brevity at this point because you have a glued guy and the entire team pretty much at full health here over time you all slowly gather around the guy who's glued to the ground and he's fighting at first (grunts) and you see he lowers his head giving into his fate at which point the head lifts he goes no kill me give me honor i have fallen all right you pull the mask off-- at which point you pop the mask off and from immediately beneath it reaches up and covers the face-- you can the face beneath it's humanoid but right as you get past the nose and the mouth area it's all melted like a horrible acid burn there's severe damage to the face he looks at you and goes kill me it's all i have (angry growl) and it's flexing and reaching out at you but it can't quite get the range it's going to attempt to try to-- no it just cannot break free of that (strained grunts) as you're still concentrating on the spell slowly the broker steps up the eyes rolled back and white the giant wound in the chest hobbles towards you as you pull your blade out she commands and gives a hand motion and the broker hobbles towards her you look down the mark that was there on your chest has vanished upon the point of the broker's death whatever enchantment was placed upon you that was keeping you under his gaze was abolished turns around and starts shambling off there is a mostly ruined set of studded leather armor that is enchanted plus one it's basic but it's need of serious repair as it currently has a large gaping hole in the chest area and a shortsword plus-one vicious shortsword as tiberius is pulling everything off of the corpse as it's trying to shamble away into the distance eventually this half-naked ruined body of this tiefling begins stepping off into the night (laughs) the old lady has mostly a basic wand it's a plus-one wand plus-one wand of the war mage a simple ring of protection and about roughly 320 gold amongst the two of them at this point in time the other guy's exhausted himself now just still in place you see the broker vanish into the shadows heading southward he gives you a look for a second i've been this my whole life they gave me purpose i follow them and you've hurt the mistresses make a persuasion roll 15 the tension in the muscles eventually relaxes and the head hangs i know not for what reason i live (grunts) at which point there's a large cracking sound as the hardened foam breaks from one leg (grunts) breaks the other leg free and stands there now before you i will walk and i will think perhaps i will drown and he turns and starts walking towards the shoreline on the other side to the west-- the cold wind picks up as the night air begins to darken a distant storm blowing over the horizon to the northeast the time draws late and cold all right that will be our freeze-frame credit high-five for the evening thank you so much kit for guesting with us this evening and for coming out and visiting us travis and laura have to run to catch a plane flight you guys go rock it out safe flight you guys are off to go travel safe bye guys all right as a note just so you guys are aware we had a contest yesterday about 530 in the afternoon during one of the streams we had everyone who was currently present in the chat room be part of this random drawing and the winner was a david kingsbury who won the opportunity to provide the name and essence of an npc in our campaign the broker is actually their construction the broker was designed by one of our viewers one of our critters we're hoping to do stuff like that every now and then in the future to bring in some critters to throw their creative mind in here and incorporate a character into our world my heart's been going a mile a minute that entire game because no dm wants to have to kill a player yeah it's pretty harsh the internet was very vocal
