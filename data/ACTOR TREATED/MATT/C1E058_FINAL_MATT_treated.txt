further ado let’s go ahead and dive into this week’s episode of critical role (spooky ethereal music) (heavy breathing) (roaring) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (crackling flames) that's not sports not that i'd know anyway let's go ahead and jump in this moment as the rest of the party is sleeping soundly i would like you vax'ildan - you're not sleeping to read your book you're right you are totally right well i'm going to have you roll initiative if you don't mind 16 all righty i can only imagine (all laugh) sorry i didn't mean for it to come off that way it just - as the surprise round has faded the gilmore-like entity draws the blade out of your abdomen snarls towards you and the round begins with the initiative on the rakshasa no vax is wearing a long silk robe - and that's it boots are a given everything else left behind i'm just telling a story yo speaking of stories - you’re reading your book so as it draws the blade back it goes in for a claw towards the face hold on to see if i hit you first (chuckles) because that is going to be a the claw (whoosh) you duck underneath as it spins around with the dagger and hits you from the other side as you come up from that you suffer 5 points of piercing damage as the dagger just barely (sssh) cuts across your face you can feel the little line of blood begin to spill down your chin as you hear the growl under the breath again i will send you to a place you'll never return from (growls) and is actually going to stay right there you're up okay all right go ahead and make an athletics check 16 you attempt to grapple and as soon as your arms reach around the rakshasa hotis breaks away yes it's a roll against a roll 17 sorry that is an action to do so okay all right all right can i have all of you guys roll a perception check you're awake you hear it all right many of you jostle awake at the sound of the shouting into your ear you hear a few words come through in the middle of your consciousness you hear “tower west jenga” that's as much as you make out the first word was enough to just shake you awake and you're not quite sure what that word was but you hear “west tower jenga” and you get the gist of that you however did hear the full phrase as you look around you percy keyleth and pike you aren't alone in your room as climbing through the window or in percy's - - had come in through the hallway you see - taliesin and - cloaked individuals blades drawn up in the air about to come down onto your asleep forms as you suddenly look up and see the figure there before you - - they look surprised to see you suddenly move i need all of you guys to roll initiative to add to this initiative order everybody (chuckle) yeah you just got that ability at level 14 so 19 (all laugh) all righty well as you all wake up the initiative round finishes as the attempted assassins do get their round on the three of you guys so there is the one that is up against keyleth right now is going to make two short sword attacks on you yep well this is - as you guys wake up you see them there and they're finishing their combat round so that's going to be a 19 to hit that hits okay you take 9 points of piercing damage and make a constitution saving throw ashley and okay you take 12 points of poison damage mm-hm yep the second strike is going to be another 19 rolled 12 again you take another 9 points of piercing damage and i need you to make another constitution saving throw you take another 12 points of poison damage so the one that's there before you percy as you're just sitting up out of your bed that's going to be an - oh that's a natural 17 24 to hit it still hits you and and this is assuming also the fact that that you guys were sleeping and not in your full armor either that's 8 points of piercing damage to you i need you to make a constitution saving throw you suffer 24 points of poison damage as whereas you manage to shrug off the effects percy you feel as the short sword strikes across your flesh the wound that's left open in the front of your long johns suddenly begins to burn and feels like it's singeing white-hot fire like an iron just out of the forge has been pressed into your chest the second strike rolls a natural 2 it's going to be a 9 this time you actually duck out of the bed as it slams down on the wood cutting into the side of the bed frame ending that guy's round that's going to bring us to the one that is against you pike so pike first strike on you that's going to be a 20 to hit though not wearing your armor at this point in time your ac would be just 10 plus your dexterity modifier 11 yeah you suffer 5 points of piercing damage and i need you to make a constitution saving throw all right yeah so you take 12 points of poison damage and that is going to be 10 so that misses you yeah so you take an additional 12 points of poison damage from the last strike correct 17 total and the second strike goes to hit you and you actually reach over grab your shield which is sitting on the table by your bed and just (ping) knock the blade nearly out of his hand but deflecting the blow that brings us to the top of the initiative round now you guys are all conscious some of you are aware of the danger you're currently in percy you're up first what are you doing of course you do (laughs) yes you would percy you do your room is right here no you do not have a window your room is on the inside you guys are on the second major floor of the castle the west tower as you know is up this way the staircase leads up and then spirals up to the west tower you haven't - you've maybe explored there a few times it's between 60 to 70 feet up percy would be pretty familiar with it you guys may have gone there here and there these two came in the windows this one you're not sure may have come in through other means or through another window the one that's in percy's room right yes currently yes okay yeah that'll hit they're only wearing studded leather and they're caught off guard at how suddenly everyone or at least you were suddenly conscious he was so quiet he was so quiet and yet you still got there before he could stab you i believe - yeah that is going to be a 5 plus 0 none no so how much damage is that total (chuckles) all right and pushes him how far back (thwoosh) it pushes him out through the door you guys hear this muffled (pshew) gunshot in the distance and this slamming sound of a heavy wooden door hitting stone percy as you watch as (boof) he's blown through the doorway landing into the hallway on his back and jumps back to his feet just in time with his blade still out in front of him okay 13 as you aim this time and fire for a second time (pshew) he does see it coming and ducks out of the way as it just scoots under his hood avoiding his head and leaving a hole in the fabric and then (kssh) taking a chunk out of the stone in the wall behind him okay that'll do go ahead and roll damage he rolls a 20 total yeah so it doesn't - it isn't affected by - it was sharpshooter wasn't it it's a +10 gotcha okay 7 points piercing damage on that (pshew) while the first hit managed to miss his face this one does (whoosh) scrape across his chin and cracks a bit of his cheekbone but not too much of an impact on him to actually affect his eyesight okay you guys at this point start hearing the distant echo of percy's voice screaming in the distance at the end of percy's turn that now brings us back to the rakshasa which is narrowed down takes the dagger and as a bonus dips it back into the sheath pulling it out with the liquid trailing off of it it's going to go in and attempt to claw and strike that's going to be a 23 with the claw you take 10 points of slashing damage and then the dagger is also going to be thrust back at you as it moves this way getting between you and the door that strike is going to be a 21 to hit all right this time with the dagger that's going to be 4 plus that's going to be 7 points of piercing damage and then i need you to make a constitution saving throw an additional 7 points of poison damage you used uncanny dodge on this that all gets reduced to just 7 total so it would've been 14 total you take it down to 7 sorry 7 points of piercing and 7 points of poison together would be 14 your uncanny dodge brings it down to 7 so you just take 7 points of damage that round all right that will end hotis's turn that brings us to scanlan i mean everything that you have would also include your armor which you can't really put on right now it would take you about a minute to put it on as it is leather armor but you can grab everything else if you wanted to or you could carry your armor awkwardly with you okay (grabbing sound) you gather some things okay (grabbing noises) okay all righty all right you would've walked through the castle at some point in the past you grab your things at the distance it is at that point and plus the fact that you have been there before you concentrate you remember a few nights you walked up there to look over the grounds because it's a beautiful view and it's close to where you guys usually stay here in the castle (zoopf) you come out of the dimension door and looking before you you can see gilmore holding a dagger out to one side and vax bleeding holding and clutching the front of his abdomen eyes darting around wildly trying to think of some sort of plan for survival so that's your action that's most of your movement yeah you're taking in the circumstances the gilmore looks over his shoulder and sneers at you (hissing growl) grog you're up (boof) there's nobody in the hallway hmm grog is sleeping in this side of the hallway around that way about there if you want to take a dash that's your movement and your dash your action you get to there as you come around and see a guy in full black cloak and some bullets (tssh) flying by shattering the stonework behind and then you see this humanoid character holding a short sword at his side growling he sees you looming down the hallway and his eyes go wide for a moment unexpected to see this giant train of a muscled entity charging down no the dash is your action you have a bonus yes all righty keyleth you're up mm-hm like - like basically just stepped out of the window and you were immediately next to it so the window is right to his left as he's staring down at you with a blade in the air yes it looks like the window is easy enough for somebody to slip through it's an open window make it quick so you're going to move around him first you're up against the wall if you want to thunderwave him you'd have to get on the other side of him to knock him away from you no because you don't leave his combat you dart off the edge of the bed catching yourself on the ground turn around the other side and (boof) what's the dc on that (singsong) dc of thunderwave vax you're up next prepare and what's your spell dc that is a 9 + 2 11 that's not enough how much damage does he take all righty 4 points of thunder damage however (boomf) it slams him back his feet hit the edge of the the lip of the window he goes flipping backwards out the side he's going to attempt to reach out and grab it that is a natural 2 (all cheer) as he's flung out the window you don't even hear the landing he's just out of the room now you have a few more 15 more feet you can run if you want to okay you throw the door open immediately out you see grog standing in the hallway clutching the axe kind of sleepy-eyed but filled with hatred and intent to kill while grinning in the center of the hallway okay after keyleth's turn that brings us to vax scanlan is 10 feet from you okay all right go ahead and make go ahead and make an attack roll - or no for this one let’s make an athletics check to try it’s essentially a type of grapple 16 okay you reach out and manage to grab the gilmore’s wrist holding the dagger his arm goes up and starts clawing these fingernails these currently not-even-visible fingernails that all of a sudden turn into these large hooks that start tearing into your skin go ahead and make a strength check to see if you can wrestle the blade from his grasp this would be the next action yeah since you don’t have any disarm-based abilities this is a more involved - no no no this - this is all athletics yeah 15 you still have the grip on him but unfortunately his fingers are too tight on the blade and you can’t quite pull it out okay you can drag him at half-speed - hasted (fwwsh) (all shout) yep (whoosh whoosh boomf) you hear two impacts both you and hotis 36 points of damage as you both (boomf) hit the bottom this stone surface essentially the ceiling and the beginnings of the entire castle here on the top both prone on the ground dazed from the impact all righty ending your turn that brings us to the assassins so - no you guys go after them because that was how the initiative order happened him yelling and waking you guys up avoided them getting an auto-crit on their first attack so be happy that at least you woke up for the last round happy so that’s two strikes against you pike and then this one here looks over the shoulder and sees you grog and is going to start darting this way and currently is out of sight yep most likely yeah that’ll be a 22 you take 7 points of piercing damage and roll another constitution saving throw yep and roll a constitution saving throw when you can the second strike this time you slam his hand with the shield and you can see he actually drops the blade and has to rush over to pick it up 13 you suffer 24 points of poison damage as the first strike this time cuts you right across the clavicle and down to the front of your chest and it’s just that sharp burning pain for a second and as you knock the other hit away all of a sudden you feel the (oomf oomf) your ears fill with bright burning-hot warmth and all of sudden the pain from your wound begins to pulse with every heartbeat as the poison hits your system and he’s going to move this way to start getting between you and the doorway that’s going to end their turns vex you’re up trinket’s going into a full - we’ll say he can do a full dash he’s gotten that far up the hallway he doesn’t see anybody yet you grab your stuff all right that’ll be an action to get all of your things together your quiver your arrows… the broom nope that’s as far as you get there cool that ends vex’s turn pike you’re up okay the wound across your chest with the pulsing poison suddenly the area that was once dark begins to light up as the holy symbol that forever hangs around your neck begins to glow with vibrant divine energy this whitish-yellow pulse of light the assassin standing there grinning seeing that he’s getting the upper hand all of a sudden realizes that you aren’t as disarmed as he thought you were go ahead and roll for the attack on this that’ll hit go ahead and roll damage on that what level were you casting it at usually you decide that before you roll the attack but yeah i assumed you were that’s fine let me look it up for you guiding bolt is 4d6 - - and then it would be an additional 3d6 for 7d6 radiant damage against him 27 points nice you see his eyes widen as suddenly you blast him in the face with this guiding bolt the impact just (boof) bursting across him leaving this trail of divine fire that’s burning around the seams of his leather armor he’s trying to pat it out but it won’t go out while it’s not burning him it’s lighting him up like a christmas tree and grog you see - from underneath pike’s door you see a little bit of a bright divine glow flash out from under the door and you hear a couple thumps against the wood from inside the room this is vex’s room keyleth’s pike’s percy - yeah scanlan’s and grog’s and vax’s were over here you can try to yeah okay all your stuff would be - you have your shield already that you pulled off the side you can grab maybe one weapon and go you’re not going to get armor though so you grab your mace all right shield mace holy symbol - nothing else yeah your gauntlets are on we’ll say the gauntlets were there you slip them on real fast as he’s pulled back and trying to pat out the flames you grab your things and rush through he does get an attack of opportunity on you as you run out of his combat range so he’s going to swing at you that does hit with your shield what’s your ac it would be 11-13 so yeah it still hits so you take 5 points of piercing damage i need you to roll another constitution saving throw you take another 24 of poison damage assassins man all righty naked with a mace and shield glowing holy symbol and just gash across her chest blood pouring from the wound sweat on her brow one eye’s half-closed ending pike’s turn percy you’re up amulet you would probably - you don’t need to take that off to sleep so i’ll let you have that this way you don’t see anyone you just see pike burst out of her room suddenly bloodied you now have a view of a guy beaming with divine light trying to pat out divine flames after swinging and getting a nice heavy wound on pike who looks like she’s barely standing this is the end of your movement so you have a fourth shot okay regular shot sharpshooter okay you have advantage on this shot by the way because of the guiding bolt that she did to him yeah because the divine fire that’s surrounding him is lighting him up like a giant birthday candle that’ll hit (gunshot sound) the guiding bolt flares off the impact hits him and sends him on his back foot he looks over and sees the smoke pouring out of the barrel as you’re aiming down for another shot you reload real fast go for it no that was just the first one just wanted to check the dungeon master will remember this no it’s fine so go ahead and roll damage sharpshooter as well 24 points of damage (gunshot) the second shot you reload fire again this time this one hits him right square in what looks like the side of his jaw shattered his cheekbone and his jaw and there’s now blood and teeth pouring out and he’s clutching the side of it shaking his head he’s in a really bad place right now and is looking over the back window realizing he’s probably going to - that hits with that as he’s turning around about to dart towards the window as he spins around in his space you take aim a second or now a third time on him fire you watch it’s obscured to see all you see is the moonlight from the outside sky coming through and the silhouette of his head and now the missing silhouette of his head - as you scatter the top half of his skull across the stone surrounding the window in pike’s room okay good to know all right ending percy’s turn you’re currently on the ground now you’re both prone hotis stands up using half of his movement looks down at you you’re clever which for the record the illusion has faded the gilmore visage is no more now you see before you the angry curled bare-teeth face of the familiar rakshasa the feeling’s mutual as you are currently prone on the ground it has advantage on you it's going to go ahead and make two strikes with the dagger against you with advantage yeah that’ll be 25 correct right so the first one hits 10 points of piercing damage he’s going to dip the blade remembering that he forgot that after the first strike then with the second strike he’s going to stab down once more yeah that’s going to be a 21 you suffer 11 points of piercing damage plus 10 points of poison damage unconscious so as you get up he just stabs and stabs again and this time as your finger’s extended the pain hits you and you just watch your vision fade to darkness that’s the end of his turn he has no more attacks so he just watches you go limp all right well scanlan you’re up first yeah you look over the ledge down about 70 feet 80 feet on the stonework you see and watch as the rakshasa now fully visible gilmore visage gone jams the blade twice into the currently laid-out back of vax as the back's body goes limp unconscious drawing the blade chuckling throwing it up in the air catching it and is preparing to go down for some finishing blows only about 60 feet yeah okay so you leap (shhh) - i’ll say for the purposes of this action you will have advantage on the strike as - right but that doesn’t affect your actual attack roll that’s more your ability check actually you should have had disadvantage earlier for that oh you did okay good it should be written on your attack it would be your proficiency bonus plus your - yeah so 23 definitely hits go ahead and roll your d8 plus damage 17 i’m adding to that attack half of the damage you take from the fall because of the force of yourself and the blade so the damage you take from the fall 29 points of damage you suffer slamming into the ground and falling prone from the attack but he does suffer an additional 14 points of damage as the blade (sssh) just sinks into the shoulder and the torso and he tenses in pain as the blade is still jammed into his form you let go of it as you slam into the ground and he draws it out with a spurt of blood and throws it to the ground angrily spinning around towards you still holding the dagger aloft looking over you do technically yeah so you come back to consciousness face-down on the ground scattered out on the stonework and the last thing as your eyes come open you hear the gentle tunes of scanlan’s voice calling you back from the darkness you glance out the corner of your eye and see that hotis is still standing with the dagger up on top no your turn’s not yet we have grog keyleth and then you they actually got initiative higher than you so we’re coming to you don’t worry so your turn hasn’t happened yet all righty good all right that brings us to grog you’re up roll an intelligence check 16 it takes you a moment and you have to bite your tongue for a moment as you’re running down the hallway but you ascertain that probably means it’s a tower probably jumped off the tower well he had the potion on the ground the courtyard would be over here actually this is no longer really part of the deal so in relation to where you guys are they’re about here all of the rooms that have windows are the ones on that side so currently the only way to get here would be to travel back where you came from and find an exit out to the top of the - these stairs go to the west tower yes all right you can still move though if you want to what action are you holding well no i mean the movement gets used in your turn regardless you just choose what action you want to hold as a trigger so if something’s going to happen you would then use whatever your action is your movement you have to use now or it’s lost your impulse hit now and if you decide not to move then the impulse loses the movement so okay that ends grog’s turn you’re up okay all right (boof) as you tear this wall open there - - it opens up before you and you can see a little bit of it gets pushed to the side because it’s a little bit elevated from the the roof area but you force it upward to where it bursts open and creates a slight ramp that leads up to what would be the roof of this part of whitestone castle you can yes all right all right you still have a little bit of movement if you want to use it okay there you go okay got you so it’d be there probably far as you can get all right cool that brings us to vax your turn you didn’t say you were holding an action for anything i’ll let you do it you’re generally not supposed to do - say you hold a dash you could do that yeah okay so yeah then you just go ahead and - so as keyleth opens the window you dash up and rush onto the rooftop and there you can see across the way as part of an action you can pick it - all right just as a note the way that the bonus attack works - well this is with your haste ability the haste would’ve faded once you went unconscious well you have an action and then you have your offhand strike offhand strike works as part of the attack action if you use your action for anything else you don’t get the bonus attack it’s part of an action don’t worry about it it’s fine let’s do it no the idea would be you don’t get a free bonus attack with any other action it’s whatever you’re attacking you then get to throw this in this way okay that’s fine we’ll do that as part of the action economy the idea is that because you’re attacking with one you can give yourself an opening to get a quick strike with the other yes no technically he’s not flanked because the other ally is prone and is not currently threatening his face - okay all right there you go that brings us to at this point waiting around this way as you guys are all distracted at this point turns around takes a dagger this is all like 3 am at whitestone castle right now that being the case the guard makes two dagger attacks one at you percy and one at you pike that’s natural 20 against you percy yes no it’s okay he rolled a 1 so you take 6 points of piercing damage that would be 18 against you pike that does hit you you take 4 points of piercing damage 1d10 actually because he hit you first - - it’s sneak attack on top of that he was hidden so that was 6 plus 34 points of piercing damage all together okay all righty that finishes their turn vex you’re up yes okay from this perspective no if you run out the door is this all on the broom you’d be able to from - yeah so from up there as you (shhh) shoot out above looking down you can see where they lie on the battlefield there go for it all righty 31 hits that does hit okay just as a note what’s your alignment okay cool just checking all right so go ahead and roll damage as a note your rage would have faded because you had gotten no damage but you also could have used your bonus action last turn for your rage that's what i figured all righty all righty nice you rush up in the air and these were with disadvantage on all the attack rolls because you’re on your broom roll three more dice and we’ll see if i negate any of these first one is first attack nope and i need you to roll a dexterity check okay so you stay on the broom you don’t fall off roll - okay roll again for the third one okay so the last two still hit no you stayed on you’re fine you do because that was the first one all right go ahead and roll no what are you going to use it for okay you watch as your mark has no effect you’ve never actually fought one before laura you try and focus your intent on attacking him and yet it doesn’t seem to find its form that does hit roll the last attack pike you’re up next nope so you pull - b-b-b all right that finishes your turn pike you’re up go for it what level (laughs) 5th go for it so 5d8 ashley and yeah 5d8 + 5 you heal yourself 21 points what else you doing now you can get about there okay so you run around to that area there okay you don’t know where the rakshasa is you have no idea no visual cue you just see a hole in the stone wall that everyone’s rushing through and that’s the most that you know yep you can do that okay yes that’ll bring you to 15 so you have that on your concentration good call percy you’re up no he ducked around the corner and trinket gave chase this corner come around the corner that way and you see trinket harrying the guy go for it hits hoo (gunshot) giant blast as one of his shoulders is blown back you see a spatter of blood across the stairs behind him and he almost stumbles back into the stairs trinket’s using this position to move even closer and snarl he’s feeling closed off go for it hits go ahead and roll damage all righty (tssh) this one actually hits him right above the pectoral muscle and blows him back now almost leaning against the stairs these two big wounds right in the middle of his chest 24 all right that hits yeah with this one as you pull back final shot you fire and it (fwoomp) right through the forehead eyes roll back as trinket lunges and tears the throat out that’s as far as you make it full movement you only saw two all right that ends your turn percy all right everyone rushes in the rakshasa glares around all righty all right so so hotis first is going to reach back and pull out - no actually no hotis is going to look up at the creature that just flew in on the broom looks at you and says you’ll do - you feel a presence begin to push into your head i need you to roll a wisdom saving throw wisdom 21 all right you resist the effect yeah he’s going to get quite a way aways from you guys i’d say because you’re prone you do get one attack of opportunity on him - no you dropped the blade the blade is not at your feet so you can punch him if you want as he runs by from prone i’ll let it happen sure 5 feet of you i’ll let you do it what do you want to do no it’s not against the rules it's a weird in-between you’re on the ground after falling from the top yeah but you see him running away and you can still cast from the ground so go for it what do you want to cast okay so you create bigby’s hand and what level is bigby’s hand bigby’s hand (whoosh) appears and rushes out and the fingers pass through the rakshasa it has no effect it twice more tries to reach out and the rakshasa shrugs it off like it’s nothing correct one could only conjecture perfect all right that’s going to end his turn currently he’s about 40 feet from you you can get up you’re still prone on the ground okay as he looks back at you as you’re singing out loud and chuckles to himself - - as it has no effect it was a very good song you have two more squares if you want yep up to level 2 so 2d4 + 5 just 5 it’s better than nothing better than nothing all righty that ends scanlan’s turn grog you’re up yeah you’ve gotten up and you can see them all there whatever this creature is is now in the distance trying to run back okay (landing thud) you leap and it’s a very small step down (footstep) 50 that’s as far as you can get about 20 feet from you yeah i’ll say yeah you being grog for the most part you don’t take your equipment too far from you because you’ve been in uncomfortable situations right fair enough you would have the chain on you still you attach it swish it and throw the axe go ahead okay 17 17 does hit go ahead and roll damage on that nice (throwing sounds) the axe slams into the tiger creature’s chest (growls breathes heavily) i’ll come back for all of you do you want to pull the blade back all right it’s on the ground next to him it’s not jammed into him - yeah it’s not hard to pull back go ahead and roll your athletics check you’re raging so you have advantage athletics you pull it back (vwoof) and it streaks past you (shhh) scatters across the ground in the other direction you haven’t quite picked it up yet you’re going to have to try again yep 15 then as you (shhh) pull it back - no not this day blood axe you’re mine (all laugh) about there eyeballing it right now from best you can tell he’s about 60-70 feet from you a semi-circle and wall you guys in all righty so like around there how long can you make the wall vax you’re on deck by the way i will pull this up okay 6-inch thick composed of 10 foot by 10 foot panels - we’ll say that that’s fine you do a 3-inch wall there 10 feet high all righty grasping vine is a 4th-level spell you can’t do it as a bonus action the same turn you did another spell okay you’re about 25-30 feet you may and it’s your turn vax all righty okay dash (swoosh) you’ll get right there unless you want to hold back - go for it he is grappled okay good to know this assassin is done - no turns for them he is being slowly torn apart by trinket against the stairs vex you’re up all righty go for it that hits 21 damage all righty you do roll for the next attack that hits yeah all righty no it’s all good all righty so (whoosh whoosh) both arrows slam (sound of flame catching) burst of flame - (growls) all right pike you’re up the hole in the wall you mean okay this actually is a climb up this isn’t a window this is an opening in the wall that keyleth made with stone shape you’re actually stepping up so you get up and the farthest you can get this turn unless you want to go full movement - you’ll not be able to make it all the way up the ramp and still do something so… you can actually yes you can okay so you come out onto the roof and you jump down about 5 feet and you’re on the roof now the moonlight coming down a somewhat clouded spotted sky in the distance you see everyone rushing towards some sort of entity that’s walled in by a stone wall he’s currently up in the face of vax you still have your action right now you do actually oh it’s coming don’t worry and with that we’re putting box music up (all chuckle) we’ve got a boombox right here - laura marisha and i don’t know why - input’s functional but we’ll just make up the music as we go so at a 7th-level flame strike that’ll be putting 10d6 damage going to attempt a saving throw that’s a natural 1 but does have advantage on saving throws against spells it’s coming isn’t it what’s the dc of your spell that’ll be an 18 yeah it does save so it takes half damage go ahead and roll 10d6 so 45 halved is 22 points of fire and bludgeoning damage so how do you want to do this how do you want to do this burst him like a foof so as you turn the corner seeing all your friends charging toward this creature knowing the fear that you heard in vax’s voice earlier the burning rage of vengeance - - burns beneath your skin - - your mostly exposed skin you grab your holy symbol drop the shield and bring your arm up like this as you do the rakshasa before you all of a sudden goes like (grunts) - you see the skin cracking - - these breaks to his exterior these strange glowing internal cracks on his body (hissing raspy breaths) i will return (explosion sound) and he detonates with a column of fire that comes bursting out of the ground from the body you can see the shattering burned bits of rakshasa flesh go flying across the entire exterior of the castle as this column 20 30 40 feet up streaks up out of the top of the castle lighting up the vicinity of whitestone and as it slowly subsides there is nothing but a pile of ash left where hotis was (cheers) which at this point guards start coming up from below - well portions of it are brown now due to the blood that has seeped into it from the various stab wounds that he’s suffered as you attempt to take the robe off you feel like the strength is sapped from your body and you’re like (raspy groan) and the more you try to pull it off the more and more you start to feel like it’s pulling the breath out of your lungs yeah make a perception check - you see guards scattered around the castle okay go ahead and roll a d20 and add 6 for your wisdom add 6 to the roll from your wisdom 14 as you cast dispel magic and start pulling the robe back you feel like someone’s pulling the skin off your body you suffer 12 points of damage as it feels like someone’s peeling the flesh off your body sam and no burned tiny chunks and ash it was a full - it was - we’re talking end-of-matrix-style agent smith scattering okay so you take vax and vex down towards the ziggurat okay you’re with them all right so you guys all make your way down as you’re going through the castle it’s in utter chaos now all the guards who in what was about 20 to 30 seconds of action since the moment of actual shouting at the top of the tower the reaction time would be great if it wasn’t such a short window they had to get up there and you guys were right in the thick of it and more trained than these soldiers okay and the guards begin to continue pushing around you can see now lights are starting to come on in the town you guys make your way down into the subterranean tunnels under whitestone where the ziggurat is you can see it once again the large pyramid-like structure okay you make your way into the central chamber it has a number of fire-based braziers that are set in there now for light that are just general fire but a lot of them are burned down to embers it’s very very low light in this area you can barely see anything in here you guys make your way inside the room it’s cold it’s dank it’s not a very comfortable atmosphere no effect okay it pulls back with no issue you reach into the bag of holding and it’s just an empty satchel all right okay as you pull it beyond the perimeter of what you've come to mark and it is marked by the way through the research of allura and the folks that have been here for a while there is a specific mark in the hallway where that barrier begins no noticeable effect no effect yeah you pull out a fancy robe (laughs) okay while this is happening you make your way down allura and gilmore weren't staying in the castle they were staying on the north side of the town okay and you do see there are lights coming on in the town and guards are now going out through the streets going through buildings searching for individuals that match the description you're at as you make your way towards gilmore's home you hear what sounds like a loud heavy thud (boof) (boof boof) another one and suddenly a crash of glass she's there by herself okay wild shape or polymorph okay (fft) you turn into a tiny little mouse yep you (fft) skirt under the door the first thing you notice now is there is a bookcase that is shattered and there is a figure slumped in the corner where the table is broken there's a little bit of light from a lantern that's been knocked over that's starting to catch fire on the curtains and as the light (whoosh) from the flames begin to pick up you can see the figure that was off to the side suddenly lifts up in the air and you now see there held aloft what looks to be a humanoid wearing dark leathers a cloak and a hood (groans) being held about four feet in the air tense up walking out of the next room you see gilmore in disarray a little bit of blood streaking down the forehead there sweaty in the face with his arm out what did you say that's what i thought and he closes his hand and you watch as the figure is just - (squelching noise) - squashed in this ball of flesh and you can see as it slowly twists it's like squeezing water out of a towel just blood pours out and then he releases his fingers and the figure (thud) falls limp on the ground like a crushed doll (sighs) (startled shout) it's not the night to be doing that to me (sighs) i need a drink right now he grabs you by the arm - - and just (shfff) there's a rush of air and a sparkle of purplish-blue energy as you guys are walking through the tunnel all of a sudden (boof) with a flash of light you see standing before you in the tunnel keyleth and a very harried gilmore who is - (pants) hi (chuckles) i'm glad to see you're all right wasn't expecting it to be my birthday as well (chuckles) and you can see now he's breathing heavy he's been a little winded and his eyes are excited to see - excited to see you for multiple reasons but excited to see that you're alive but as you ask him this question you see his demeanor darkens a little that you had interests elsewhere i for one could really go for some heavy alcohol i don't know then let us go search and then we shall drink nevertheless and gilmore steps into the fog cloud - (all laugh) he lets you go he pulls back with a smile and kind of reads you he gives a nod of understanding and takes a step back i'm sorry let's go make sure that everyone else is all right come follow me he turns around and goes into a jovial jog you guys make your way up back up to the castle kashaw and zahra are both fine you come to them and find that their rooms were not disturbed as neither of them were in the - actually no kashaw was (laughs) yeah no you do come to the point where there are now a bunch of guards swarmed around the outside of kashaw's room as you push past there is blood everywhere everywhere on the walls the ceiling the floor across the bed and you see sitting on the edge of the bed spear in hand shield tossed to the side also covered in bits of viscera kashaw who's currently leaning against the edge they knew better right what else was going to happen oh just one i'll take a shower first but then a drink i always hated cats oh nice to meet you too we'll say he closes the front a little bit right right it's nice to meet you too i don't normally dress like this either so don't worry huh i like you and he walks out i'll meet you guys in a minute and he goes off to clean himself up zahra's fine there's been no attack on zahra all right you guys gather your stuff at this time cassandra's awake and she's actually in the process of dealing with the guards that are coming back with information they've been sweeping parts of the town haven't found anyone else there's been no real follow-up to any other figures that have been found beyond the few select individuals and it's at this time as you guys gather your stuff and begin to head back out that allura comes into the front of the castle she comes in hair tossed and she looks a little frazzled is everyone all right she looks over her shoulder and you see kima come walking in wearing what looks like a long nightshirt her maul in her hand and dragging behind by the foot what looks to be a mostly-mashed face of one of the assassins that tried to find its way into their home no not alive at all the head is caved in and there's a long trail of crimson that leads all the way down the walkway down the footpath of the castle and disappears towards the base of the walkway at the north side of whitestone (grunts) and throws him (repeated thuds) tumbles onto the ground smears across a bit of the stonework you too i can see the rest of you guys at least seem to be okay allura goes like what did you say i'm quite familiar with them yes well they come from the hells but they make allies all throughout the realm they're manipulators they masquerade as anyone that they think would help their current intent and goal they lie they deceive they convert so you slew this rakshasa tonight well that will be vengeance on two then it will be back there are a couple of ways all of them involve going to its home plane and destroying it there so unless you marvel a trip to the nine hells it's going to be a bit of paranoia for a while it does take weeks months for them to regain their form but the process is very painful for them and as far as what i've read at least they only really care about getting back at the ones that took it from them since you're alive its vengeance was not sated i think that's two of you on its shit list well for right now it's screaming its way back to the pit of its own creation it will take weeks months before it reforms it will be very vulnerable during that time mind you it's not the most welcoming place either but (sighs) if we make a journey there in a few weeks' time we could probably find where it's currently recouping and slay it for good how long will what take the journey instantaneous to find it longer to survive that journey that is no easy task as it is a place of great danger and great evil it's possible it depends on what sort of magic wards it may have i don't know where it is we could certainly try that is the issue all creatures don't like to make the same mistake twice thence the why it seems it brought friends i am certain there are many it will be hard to find this rakshasa now or any time in the very near future as it's still finding its seed of corporeal form (sighs) but i agree this has to be rectified i'm a bit confused but do what you need to do regardless and she looks to gilmore who has taken a breath now and has pulled an evening flask out of his night robe he takes a swig off of it goes i think we need to quicken our reinforcements of the city i think we need to make certain that not only are we scry-proof but i believe we need to find a way to alert ourselves of any sort of celestial or fiend intrusion the very definition the rakshasa - at this point gilmore is like that's actually a very valid point how would it - did it meet us how would it know what i look like you mean last night dinner would have been the last time yes at this point allura thinks for a second she goes i'm fairly certain that they can peer into the minds of those nearby and can read surface thoughts it may know more secrets than you think it does which makes it that much more important that we eliminate it i can work on that yeah it's just smashed inward yeah it's horrifying straight-up horrifying okay all right so you have five questions you can ask the creature as it sits there and you guys watch as pike comes over in her robe and sits down next to it you touch your symbol and reach out and touch the body and all of a sudden you watch as the chest rises again (rasping inhale) you hear this horrible sucking sound as air is brought into the chest cavity he doesn't breathe out he just holds the air in and the deformed wrecked bone shard-pierced face that once was this assassin which you can see now it looks to be loosely elvish in appearance or at least there's some essence of elvish to its form but the eyes are gone the eyes are just mush it slowly sits up and turns towards you pike going (rasping groans) (slowly) hotis hired us we run the clasp in stillben i don't know he had information he led us here instructed our strikes we were 6 in total (chuckling) that's a fine - spireling veekar (groans) and with that the last bit of air that had been trapped in the chest cavity has been utilized and the body (rasping groan) goes back to its still rest no longer moving no longer puppeteered by your divine energies and gilmore's like (weak chuckle) i actually have one that's pretty rough in my place right now i got a little angry oh just one is there one that was left alive we'll find out all right drinks please (laughs) he's holding it like a pair of soiled underpants all - (shudders) he takes it for a second he puts his hand over and his eyes flicker for a second with a spark of arcane energy and he sits back no this is indeed a cursed robe it's a robe of flaying (chuckles) to the right people maybe oh i don't want to have any hand in this type of business i'm sorry i deal with above-the-board magical items you've gone creative with me but even that was relatively harmless this slowly takes the skin off of its wearer i don't wish to have this part of my repertoire well if you've removed it from him then the enchantment's been broken ah yes but of course you've certainly earned it (stuttering) i wouldn't say i know everything about everything between the two of us he takes a minute and walks around you looking at the armor up and down looking at you up and down a little bit but mostly at the armor his eyes flare a few times with arcane sparks this is a powerful vestige my friend this has existed for quite some time and you've - well there's certainly a bit of dark divine energy around it it looks like it has the capability to resist most elements when given the instruction and it safeguards the life of the bearer and it looks like there's some sort of a - tell you what follow me and he stops and he goes it's really me this time follow me all right and he walks outside of the front of the castle to the walkway stepping over the crimson smear that once was the one assassin and he walks up to the edge of the sheer cliffs that are on each side of that walkway and the elevated cleaved mountain the castle was built on he walks up to the very edge with you and goes do you trust me as soon as you look down you feel a thrust as he pushes you off the cliff at that moment you suddenly instinctively look up and from outside the back of the armor (fwwsh) - - these giant black raven wings spill out from the sides you get the sense that this feature to the armor was only recently - you go from falling to swooping over the forest on the outside of whitestone (startled noise) you can see he's a little nervous but he's smiling (nervous laughter) thank you no it's all right i would have been fine he freezes for a moment still figuring out his boundaries with the dynamic being what it is but eventually he gives in and you feel his arms take you in as well and you guys have this long honest connecting hug and as this happens the wings also wrap around and envelop the both of you and then time seems to pass for a minute and as you release him the wings (fluttering sound) scatter into black feathers in the wind and disappear he steps away from you and you can see there's just a little streak down the side of his face and he reaches up and smacks you on the cheek a little bit glad you're all right that goes both ways don't forget that (laughs) oh that's once every dawn that can return to you (laughing) that would have been really funny it's for up to an hour it can last just so you're aware but once per day you give yourself a fly speed of 60 by this time some of the guards have come back reporting that they haven't seen anything yet there are folks that were following the tracks into the forest but the tracks have mostly gone cold whoever it is knows how to not be found it's part of their job galdrick all right okay you shout out for about 10 15 minutes or so before you hear a distant howl (howl) a few more moments pass before you hear (panting) coming up from the outside of the forest the large gray dark wolf (padding footfalls) (sniffs) (licks chops) licks his deep pearly-white bladed incisors and turns around and - (grunts) - takes off into the forest at triple-speed all right you all at these twilight hours find yourselves gathering your friends and allies for a long-needed drink until the sun begins to rise you all appreciate the friendship that you’ve maintained the survival of those that were endangered and eventually find yourself rather tipsy finding your way back to bed this time with quadruple the guards at the door - - of each of your rooms resting welcome back so as you guys find yourself having a good night’s sleep waking up restfully around midday to the early afternoon here in whitestone everyone except for you vax you as you went to sleep found as opposed to a restful night especially given the circumstance a perpetual onslaught of terrible nightmares recapping the events of the night before with alternate possibilities looking and seeing gilmore plunging the blade into your stomach seeing your friends and family torn apart by demons called forth by this rakshasa returning for vengeance you were tossing and turning and woke up sweaty unfortunately you do not get the benefits of a full rest so you're still at the hit point value that you had before you can use hit dice yeah you actually take the time to go ahead and rest up and even then your body's just restless you find yourself unable to spend those either you're basically rocking in place and playing over the imagery in your mind over and over again and there's a perpetual cold sweat across your brow yeah you come to allura's home - okay ugh you make your way back to the house where allura's been staying and knock on the door door opens kima's there hi you guys rest okay everything all right any problems yeah she's - would you like some coffee as you come inside you can smell coffee brewing you see allura comes out of the kitchen area of this home that she's staying in oh hi i'll get another cup and she leaves actually no her hair is perfect no she - yeah way too well put together for being this early in the conscious day i know you're telling me right it's obnoxious (sighs) she brings coffee back and sets it in the center of this serving table for guests you start drinking the coffee it's very well put on nice and sweet so what - it was a very rough night let's go have a look then and so they go ahead and they walk back with you (laughs) it's good coffee eventually you've found your way wandering through the hall to get some food sunken sockets grog passes by you in the hallway and you see vax hand against the wall walking by looking dazed and a little weary okay oh you proudly hear through the doorway all right as time passes eventually your sister allura and kima make their way towards you to go ahead and check in he's made his way out allura takes a look at you you certainly don't look well it might be lingering enchantment from the robe let me try something and she pulls back and thumbs mentally through some sort of index in her head and brings her hand up eras to no est and begins drawing this strange glyph in the air that where her finger traces you can see a slight sparkle falls behind before it forges some sort of a letter that you don't recognize and it passes through you (foomf) and as it gets through you can't help but to get pushed back for a second do you feel any different no change from what you can tell still just bad place yeah the effect hits and intends to remove any poison disease circumstance no change in physical presence kima have you any ideas here let me have a look at you she pulls you down to her position just pushing your eyelids open grog do you want to help me with this i'm not going to just seems tired to me you guys walk out and see as allura sits back with a slight chuckle next to vex as you see both grog and kima manhandling a very exhausted-looking vax in the center of the hallway you want to make a medicine check you hear this echo in the distance of him shitting himself and you're like eh 23 you push kima aside and take a very intense look at his body oh very intense look over physically there does not appear to be any ailment to him whatsoever there are traces of exhaustion in him and you do have a point of exhaustion by the way for a lack of evening's rest but there's no signs of onset of splotchiness or diseases there's no pulsing or darkened vein marks nothing physical the brooch that was given to him by percy okay i attempted to dispel in case there was any spell that was still sustained on him kima goes not really my specialty at the moment my apologies all righty and so as percy has wandered off at this time you guys both hold hands and channel through both of your abilities the greater restoration spell suddenly you feel like this dark hook that was in the center of your being is lifted and as it dissipates you're still exhausted and still lost an entire evening's worth of rest but whatever was keeping you in that nightmarish realm of stasis seems to have been dispelled better tired your midsection is very sore from the constant flexing you gather that there was some curse that had taken hold of his body you gather probably something to do with the rakshasa yeah jug fills up with clear cool water no in fact you spend probably a good 3 to 4 minutes pushing through vax refuse while nobody else has thought to actually come and stop you when they've already figured out what the problem was roll a medicine check (all laugh) it seems fairly standard bile and excrement no signs of parasites nothing there is one feather no effect no effect (fwssh) fills with dark ale at this point you hear a guard's voice shout hail vox machina downstairs please scanlan are you still reading this morning okay did you get a full night's rest though okay yeah so your exhaustion point is gone all right so you guys head downstairs as you get there the front gates to whitestone castle - no the front doors to the main entranceway are partially open and the guards are waiting there as you see a shadow step in from the outside daylight you see step inside to the center of the castle a very large dark-furred wolf carrying something within his jaws drops down on the ground another dark-cloaked figure he is not alive there is a snapped neck on this individual you can see a series of scrapes across the face this person as you go and inspect had been rushing quickly through the forest and had taken a number of small injuries in the haste to escape however could not escape the ever-watching vigil okay yeah you actually find about 320 gold pieces on the body you find 6 vials of poison you're not too familiar with poisons vax would be he could have a look at it 300 gold fist-sized glass sphere about that big he walks up to you (sniffs) smells your hand and steps into it he head-butts the palm of your hand and then runs his head under it there's a familiar scent you can see there's an immediate familiarity with you that wasn't there before you can see the eyes dark and piercing into you (grunts) he glances towards you you put your hand out (sniff sniff) he sniffs your hand you do and he seems to begrudgingly give into it (grunt chomp) he picks it up in his jaws again and starts walking outside spits it on the outside of the grounds rolling off the edge it doesn't go completely off but one of the legs is dangling off the side and the guards wait there then take it and pull it away the wolf's not going to eat the dead body but it's done he's done his job he takes it out of the castle gets it out of your way and then begins to step back down the walkway path south of the castle making his way back towards whitestone and the surrounding forest you shake it you actually look inside there's a cloudy liquid at the center of it when it was at rest it had no real motion but as you shake it it swirls on the inside (laughs) she takes a look at it there's a little sparkle of arcane energy in her eyes again you're starting to get the theme here there is a specific spell that she's using to identify these objects you've seen it done before she takes a look at it and goes well i can see why this would be very useful for a member of the clasp it's a scrying eye when you take essentially 10 minutes to focus on the eye you can scry as per the spell but it can only be used for 10 minutes and it cannot be used until the next dawn well in theory you'll have to find out anything a scrying spell could as per the spell once per day you can see allura her face gets a little stern at this this is precisely the issue we have here if they could scry information anyone can which is why i'm going to get with gilmore and go and get together with the rest of the arcane minds here in whitestone and we're going to try to ward this place from any sort of intrusion if possible i'd like to blanket this entire area with illusion i'd like it so those who should not know that whitestone even exists do not honestly do what you're doing although i may need some aid from you there and she looks towards you pike and says if we're going to find out where this rakshasa is and how to head it off at the pass in the coming weeks i think your divine nature would be of great aid you and keeper yennan between the two of you i think we could map out a plot to head it off at the pass and when you return and are ready head into the hells ourselves and take it down while there's still time all right so you write down gate stone on your inventory as you can all right where are you off to then you just walk down the path from whitestone castle all right so you guys start making your way down towards whitestone proper as you walk along the way you look around and you see a boy holding a wheelbarrow nearby is picking up a bunch of fruit that had fallen out i'm terribly sorry didn't mean to bother you he puts them back in and keeps wheeling on my cabbages yes they're both standing at the northern base of the sun tree in the center of the town square you see them hugging and give each other a kiss on the cheek choco taco by the way is draconic for a fine cheese sandwich in wildmount it's a delicacy keyleth skips off in the direction - make an acrobatics check acrobatics 10 the limes (thud) all over the ground keyleth slowly backs away realizing the moment goes to get less-bruised limes make another acrobatics check yeah yeah as you guys spend the rest of the afternoon - which you woke up late for the most part so the afternoon's pretty short but as the sun sets here in whitestone the cloud cover takes in once more and a very light drizzle begins to hit the rooftops and you hear in the distance people finishing rebuilding the roofs that were destroyed in the battle some buildings that are starting to be put back up again the city is definitely over time coming back to life you also know that throughout the day you can see allura and gilmore and the farseer eskil are beginning to mark areas in the town you're not sure what for but you gather it's probably preparation for their wards they're going to start putting up throughout whitestone during this time you make your first tinker check 21 okay working a good portion of the evening - yeah you start making some decent headway you get the stirrups well-bolted into the side making sure not to interrupt any of the enchantment you also begin to work on the finer elements of the seat portion of it which in itself will have a gimbal hinge to adjust based on positioning which will allow her to actually functionally sit on the seat we'll get to that in a minute the rest of you guys anything else you're doing other than just drinking in the time you have left as she cackles loudly the hat atop her head is everything you hoped for (all crack up) another tinker check you guys are drinking carousing in a local tavern laughing at her new hat 25 as the wee hours begin to click by the rest of you have finished your evening of drinking - there you go yeah it's more stylistic it's more vex'ahlia yes i'm going to start up here as the evening progresses up to that point in time you're battling and battling with this gimbal and making sure that everything itself can sustain the necessary weight without putting too much pressure on a single point within the broom to actually splinter the wood or damage the actual object you're not even paying attention to the fact that there's very little airflow and the sweat's been dripping off of your face as you just need to get this project done and in the moment it finally hits you not knowing what time it is but you lift it up in your hands and you can see the completed work hoping it will function we shall see but for now your project is done all right roll an attack nope the arrow smashes into the side of the half-eaten chicken which in your drunken state was not on your plate and you hear a voice go hey that was my meal (arrow impact) the chicken now stapled to the wall by the arrow and the somewhat frustrated-looking gentleman who is on the other side of the table who has just been eating on his own is like - how are you going to pay for that he hasn't really noticed the flight thing at this point so he's just like (awed) oh it's okay it's burned i can tell i want my chicken untouched and he starts cutting into it trying to find pieces that are edible as this is happening while the flying display is happening and you're really intent on watching all the mechanisms work and watching how it adjusts to her weight and you want to be damn sure that everything that's supposed to move is while this is happening as you continue to drink percy - all right as percy you see the opportunity now as vax moves to take that same spot next to pike make a perception check grog someone fucking threw something at your head (screams) he slams onto a table you can now see there are two guys in the back who are probably part of the building crew here look at each other and roll up their sleeves we doing this they rush in and start slugging at you and it goes into an old-style - a giant brawl breaks out at this time you hear people laughing and the music picks up more and there's tables being tossed over there's a hint of gingerness to it no one's damaging the - - you can see in general in the city there's a lot of tension to get out from previous events and there are a few folks in this town in this particular tavern that are enjoying throwing a couple of punches and taking a few and there are some folks that are watching and enjoying watching this fight go down and while no one here can throw a punch to really give you much of an issue grog it is fun to feel the energy again all right as eventually the fight dies down another round of drinks are purchased by those who are involved you all find yourselves now into the late late hours once again probably pushing another sunrise in the next hour or so you gather you should probably find yourselves to rest you guys make your way back to whitestone castle find a full evening's sleep eventually the late morning early afternoon comes about you're well-rested and a night of good dreams come to you in contrast to the bad night before you do manage to get full rest [no audio] (giggles) the flushed gnome runs off you guys all eventually gather your materials your weapons your equipment and anything else you need for the journey and you all meet just on the outside of the front doors to whitestone castle for a final goodbye there waiting for you allura the realmseer and gilmore kima's off elsewhere right now and cassandra follows up behind as you guys step out they all nod their heads allura walks over to you and pats you on the shoulder don't worry have faith and when you return i'll know how to absolve you of this cursed individual and i think you'll have hopefully something else even more helpful in your midst cassandra comes up by you and rests her chin on your shoulder percy stay alive please i mean it no you're not and she smacks you in the face (dshh) once everyone else is looking she rights herself again she takes her coat and buttons it there in the middle i cannot express truly how important your influence has been in this city and i don't think you realize just how many lives here are for the better since you've walked into our humble home and it is for that reason that i request on the behalf of all of us here in whitestone that you come back safe that is all good luck she puts her shoulders back and walks back into the castle don't call me that she walks back in allura and gilmore look at each other allura nods and walks in the castle after pike leaving gilmore there gilmore looks at you all sorry about forgetting the hug last time it wasn't my intent i have no words you all look fabulous if you find anything really amazing that you don't need i'm trying to build up stock again (chuckling) i kind of lost two shops in the same month well i mean eventually you've got to have long-term plans my dear please i'm far beyond the adventuring business and income's been stale for a while but stay safe be careful it's weird out there very very weird out there it's weird out there take everything with caution trust nothing keep your eyes open and for the love of god absolve yourself of any preconceptions fly high my bird he walks up and gives you a kiss on the cheek and then walks into the castle after the rest where are you specifying where are you going you haven't been in there okay for a moment there's just this still quiet and then this very cold breeze begins to pick up around your feet (wind noise) and it's like someone smacked each of you on your back really hard (boomf) and with that your vision flashes for a moment and you look about and everything has changed you step forward into the now-temperate air you're struck immediately by the vibrant purples blues and pinks of a sunset sky that envelops the clouds above you just above the treeline that surrounds you the smell of fresh morning dew and poppy upon the breeze rolls past your nose and fills your senses as you look down and see yourself wading through what looks like two-foot-tall knee- to thigh-high grass vine-covered tree trunks wrap and rise around you curling as they stretch upward like a bending dreamscape of hundreds of small bobbing fairy lights that float in the shadowed distance of the forest you can see what looks to be a few small pools of water that have gathered in this small glade that surrounds you and that's where we'll pick up next week or two weeks from now
