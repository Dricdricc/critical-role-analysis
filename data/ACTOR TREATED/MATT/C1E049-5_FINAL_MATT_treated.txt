moment but things to consider part of tonight's fun is at certain points during the story if you roll really crappily on a roll or you want to get that extra action in you're doing good and you want to get that extra attack or extra ability each of you have constructed and have at your disposal a goblin song that is custom to your character you may choose to sing this song out loud on the stream and doing so will gain use of that reroll or that extra action use it sparingly it's only once in a while possibly a once-a-night type circumstance but i'm exci-- (burps) pardon i'm excited to hear all of your individual songs as we progress it's how it's the reaction i get nervous guys great so that being the case let's go ahead and get this show on the road here in the sandpoint hinterlands nestled in the western side of the devil's platter mountain range there lies the bird-cruncher tribe of rather rambunctious goblins known for their deft trapping skills having earned their name and the majority of their food supply by snaring wild birds and eating them raw you five have grown up together here among the caves and cliffs over the past six years outliving many of your other brethren making you tough although most of you were the runts discarded as weak and useless you were all taken in and raised within your cages which is how most goblins are raised by the sagely guffeye an ancient goblin oracle of nearly 30 years of age who enjoyed the idea of having her own troop of personal guardians she shouts that she is touched by the sight of zogmugot lady last-breath and the goblin hero-god of flotsam and scavenging though many of her visions have led to grave misfortune and her favor within the tribe has waned but you guys believe her mostly this cold overcast autumn morning rolls in and the five of you are returning from a morning snare run when you hear the sound of crackling shouts from old guffeye's crag porch come come the dream the sight come and she darts back into her little cave hole entering her home the familiar smell of pungent spices and rotting wood hits your nose and this hoarder hole of a home is crammed to the brim with driftwood molded leather metal scraps torn hides broken pottery all sorts of other beautiful pieces of junk nostalgia comes over you as you glance at the empty iron cages you once grew up in now partially buried and filled with wet wool as you guys enter old guffeye steps onto a small box and turns her snow-blind eyes clouded and bulging above her toothy grin my runts the lady gifts guffeye the wait is broken i have a vision once more a thing a great thing was shown to guffeye in both these eyes a stone of crack and thoom a rock that barks like the storm this rock this stone guffeye must have this guffeye must get you you must get this stone bring it to me for the lady's blessing i already like you the best-- --but i will like you twice best well i awoke this morning envisioning just how much more i like piglet than the rest of you-- silence upon brewing my morning thatch tea the vision struck my face i dropped it it shattered in a beautiful clattering of broken pottery and i saw before me a reminder that today is a special day the sun the sun rise highest in the sky today is the day of the human festival in sandpoint-- filthy stupid human festival the lady showed me a man a man in blue blue everywhere in robes a church man (spits) (spitting) zaan-- zantos guffeye saw the people around the churchman at this festival-- the churchman has the storm rock on him so go to this sandpoint go to this human festival find this blue-skinned blue-robed church-man and take the stone for guffeye yes the lady also showed me other goblins know stupid stupid seven-tooth tribe also wants stone going to city now you go sneak in find churchman take storm rock before seven-tooth dumb-dumbs bring back to guffeye get blessing-- and good meal promise this i can provide piglet you're now second most favorite bring me stone become first favorite now go time is wasting (laughs) as you guys exit the cavern you go to your various hidey-holes gather all your materials your weaponry whatever things you think you may require on this journey you know that the direction is northwest past the ravenroost mountain pass towards this town of sandpoint and that is where your path lies the clouds begin to gather overhead at this point in time a gentle rain slowly begins to hit down from the sky above depends on who's the best leader to find their way there i guess-- i would like for you to make a survival check as the leader of his group well whoever one is leading well we'll say you let (laughs) you let him lead for a while as you start heading northwest as you begin to pass the south part of the ravenroost mountain pass you're led into a relatively thick patch of very very painful bramble thicket chunk and the most painful path does manage to deal two points of damage to all of you as across your flesh being dragged through the bramble thicket until eventually snizzler decides to rise up in frustration and take over the leader position go ahead and make your survival check so well done wading deeper and deeper into the bramble thicket now under the guidance of snizzler you all take an additional one point of piercing damage as you're scratching your way through the rain intensifies starting to echo through the mountain ranges in the distance the storm appears to be getting relatively stronger however during this travel the rain that is washing down the side of the mountain does lead you to a position of the thicket that isn't quite so heavy and eventually you guys make your way outside of the immediate physical danger of the terrain at which point a large bolt of lightning hits a tree maybe about 20 feet off from you sending sparks flying the tree bursts into flames and tumbles onto the ground i need-- you've done a few loops in the area-- did anybody else want to try and lead this expedition all right mezek all right and with this mezek for as far as goblin franticness is concerned manages to medicate himself with various alcohols to a state of concentration pushes forward deeper into the forest against your better judgement but in doing so stays out from the rainfall manages to avoid a lot of the lightning storm which is now blowing over the southern portion of the mountain range and leads you guys over the next couple hours through a bit of a muddy sloshy forest terrain towards the outskirts of the actual town oh no it's about mid-day now it's pushing-- you're pushing into like the early afternoon at this point you've lost a few hours on your journey all right guys-- following mezek's path you eventually make your way through the forest alongside the southern side of the lost coast road coming upon the edge of the trees to the tyrandarock river it surrounds the town of sandpoint itself and encompasses it it's a port town that's set on the ocean and this river surrounds the outskirts of it so you find the edge you hit the muddy banks of this river and looking across you can see now the actual city proper sure as you guys glance from the flash-- it's okay you see the bolt of lightning strike a distant watchtower on the far side of the city that has a rod specifically to pull these types of things out of the way glancing over i'll have you guys roll a perception check if you could everybody go ahead and roll perception marisha all right so we got two 17s here from you guys al right so as you guys are glancing about you can see the city before you and it generally loses most interest to all of you especially mezek who while your direction sense has been great today once you get to the actual location of your intent you've lost all interest and you're playing in the mud the thick clay on the side of the river smeared on your face okay now you're not sure if it was mud because it spooked you a little so the two of you glance over and you can see there are two bridges that lead to the city itself that go over but both of them look extremely heavily guarded you have two passes of three sets of guards that walk back and forth armed with crossbows you guys do-- as the midday rain is still pouring down and it's causing the surface of the river to spatter you can see there's a little bit of what would have been a morning marine fog that's been burning off since it went out there so it's no longer really at your disposal however you two do notice right across the river against the bank before it rises up to the top of the city itself you see barely visible the outside of a metal grate some sort of a subterranean sewer or tunnel system that is sealed shut across the way it's a good say 80 to 100 feet across that river right now and it does have quite the current to it probably because the rain's been pouring for most of the morning smart one here doing the math what do you want to do to get there it's up to you guys you don't have to yes it has started the game has indeed started yes for you i need you to make a reflex saving throw so go ahead and roll a d20 and add your reflex you rolled a 19 you go and (raspberry noise) begin to spew grease from the outside of your goblin staff-- piglet however a little ball of anger and muscular rage instead darts out of the way slamming into the side of the sandbank that you are currently playing in the mud and clay with causing that to collapse partially onto you you are now partially buried under the clay and what little bit of your head is pointing out is now being sprayed with grease looking there's about six to each bridge that you can see it's hard to say a town full of people-- make an intelligence check go ahead and roll a d20 natural one what ten altogether okay so you know humans you know them pretty well and they're tall but they're pretty weak there's a lot of them on these bridges that's a lot of really really weak things conversely in the sewer who knows what's in there there's filth there's scavenging pieces and possibly dirty humans so it's up to you do you want to go out in a delightful goblin blaze of glory or do you want to go out in a delightfully messy goblin blaze of glory sure make a survival check okay it takes you guys the better part of about 30 minutes or so as you find things in the nearby edge of the woods you start pulling up the bits of clay and sand that you were buried under as something caught your foot and it was a bit pointy but you found a chunk of driftwood that looks to have made its way there i would like you all to make a stealth check as you are now having to dart in and out of the forest to find material plus 20 goblins oh my god okay you guys deftly running back and forth along the bank of river grabbing what you can out of the sand and the dirt apparently entirely unnoticed as there even is a series of guards that come by four of them that just walk on past one of them you swear stared into the forest right at you and went-- hey steven did you leave some gnomes out here stupid gnomes and they keep on walking past wait i want some garden gnomes and he comes back in nah they look filthy all green from the mold stupid garden gnomes and he keeps going so you've crafted this raft it's less of a raft and more of a pool noodle buoy thing this is less like tom hanks in castaway more gollum in the river you guys are having to hold on and move across however as you push it into the water it is buoyant and it does seem to carry you the current does tend to push it so you guys are going to have to guide it across the current if i could have you all make a swim check five 17 okay so you guys are pushing along the three of you are back to back feels like goblin power getting in there you glance over your shoulder and see the two of them going (yelling) ivan and as part of the screaming echoes out you hear someone in the distance go d'you hear that okay you guys stop moving and the current carries you and you slowly begin to rotate in the water and you're being rained on in the face and you see a couple guards look as you drift under the bridge on the far left side of where you entered and they look down and go man they'll throw away anything these days perfectly good piece of wood as it drifts under the bridge you guys have a moment to go ahead and try and push to shore go ahead and roll swim checks again haha it's okay so as you're pushing there you're making headway except for the fact that snizzler is going like (yelling) and pushing your heads under trying to climb out of the water as the splashing and chaos hits you guys (impact noise) hit the sandbank on the other side of the river you have managed to cross it primarily i want both of you guys to roll initiative to see who gets to the vomit first what did you get you guys both-- and with that mezek grabs a hand scoop up of this crusted sand-- puts it in the jug closes it off at which point you hear another voice say did you hear laughing i'm going to go check and you hear a number of footsteps coming your way okay what kind of sound are you producing on the direction of okay so at this point you guys watch as grizznak spins around points his staff forward and quite a ways away you hear this boisterous (indistinct drunk storytelling) start blasting from the opposite side of the bridge up near the rocks that begin to meet the base of the city's foundation the footsteps shift and you hear them going across the wood planks above you on the bridge in the direction that he set now is your time to go ahead and dart for the grate on the outside of the sewer go ahead and roll stealth checks all you guys 23 jesus you vanish from time and space you have a fifth-dimensional goblin on your team now okay you guys darting through the rain using the edge of the rocky-- you get to the grate and there is indeed browntooth sitting there picking his teeth with one of his blades piglet go ahead and make a strength check roll and add your strength modifier 25 with one hand piglet holding the hammer in one hand grabs the grate spins it in place sending rust and metal sparks and throws it behind her (sploosh) at which point you hear the howl of distant wind and the droplets of condensation within the depths of this sewage system beckoning to you as an entry portal to this city secretly privately and hopefully to wherever this festival is happening where you can gather this storm rock okay good to know you guys step your way inside the sewer the slick stone structure of it has lots of residue buildup from various minerals that have come through as well as various degrees of wastewater that have found their way to the river the smell is horrible for anyone but you guys it's a familiar scent as you make your way inside-- i'd say about 100 feet in as you're going through the darkness here-- but you guys can see fine in the dark this is goblin speciality go ahead and make a perception check all right glancing about you do see a cluster of some sort of an egg sac that is pushed up into the corner along the curved rotation of this duct it's roughly the size of a large melon and it twitches-- as you're looking up at it (fwoosh) it bursts into flames you go and glance and the slight tiny series of squeaks you hear as the hundreds of tiny spider young have burned to their end there is a nice waft of cooked scent that hits your nose and the rumbling in your tummy takes over as you guys all leap in at once grabbing small chunks of what you can we learned a very valuable lesson this evening tumblr get on that you did this phil you did this progressing forward for the next couple hundred feet into this slick sewer making your way along embankments where bits of clutter broken sticks chunks of wayward stone and mortar pieces that have washed down here have built these small half-walls of junk that have mucked up the side okay you guys walk forward until (explosion) you all glance over your shoulder real fast-- go ahead and roll an attack 14 okay you turn around real fast as a piece of rock that is set loose from this small firecracker explosion whips through the air and you punch it with your fist go ahead and roll damage with that you turn this piece of mildewed slimy sewage-encrusted stone to dust as it (poof) in front of you holding your fist as it shakes there quivering your eyes open any buzz you may have carried from your morning alcohol has waned for now and you are far more awake and conscious-- with a mild headache the path does split here now and divides to the right and left to see sure go for it piglet you're the instinctual tracker most goblins hunt with traps you hunt with teeth so you get down and (sniffing) begin getting into the muck and pushing it aside less than a visual perspective here you can smell that the bulk of the waste that comes through here comes from the left path that probably means more waste means more people all right so you guys-- (laughs) you charge forward here-- no you had to smear it on your teeth a little pushing forward you guys travel another 80 or so feet before you come onto a large series of waterfalls that run into a central open cesspool area that is down below this path the actual path diverts and goes around this central tunnel before it continues in a singular direction as the water is pouring in make a perception check okay you look down into the cesspool and hock a loogie to see how far it goes down (splash noise) you glance up and you can see there is some sort of a large heavy grating that most of the water is pouring down from you're not quite-- looks like a lot of the rainwater runoff from the city itself however you do notice a glimmer from what little bit of light that is bouncing through from the surface and your goblin eyes catch this little glimmer in the corner and you glance over and instinctually run towards it you go ahead and take a look you find a hefty well-made human shortsword what did you roll what was the total on your perception check again 25 you take this and the blade is perfectly clean this place is filthy this blade is perfectly clean and as you glance over underneath the waterfall you see another glimmer both of you guys make initiative checks right now so as you see this and you glance over out of the corner of your eye you see piglet her eyes go wide and both of you have that immediate knowledge of me first you both dart off around two different sides of this cistern and starting to get there however piglet you get there first and immediately leap towards this shiny and the shiny is bigger than you expected is it a five-pound maximum you go ahead and cast mage hand towards that shiny and pull and (grunts) it's a little heavier than you can pull you get there and you grab on to it what you notice as you get there is a set a full set of a breastplate armor human size giant breastplate with some shoulder pauldrons and a human ribcage on the inside of this breastplate you smell it marrow hasn't been tapped yet you can it's pretty big yeah you could sleep in it so you grab the ribcage break off a couple ribs start gnawing on them sucking the marrow out you do notice getting there and inspecting the ribcage is white it is clean as well you can see upon close look as she is gnawing not even paying attention you see these little teeth marks on it like rats have come through here and there overall the bone is perfectly clean the armor itself is spotless looks like it's been perfectly polished you could try and pull scrap from it if you wanted to try and scavenge pieces of the metal could certainly try that if you want to yes okay i will say for this-- you know what go ahead and make a survival check on this to try and-- 12 you manage to (grunt) for a minute with some help from a couple other of the goblins pull one of the pauldrons off you take it and-- based on your combat aesthetic it's not going to be much of a help to you sure the armor yeah go for it the armor itself does not appear to have a magical essence to it in fact a close look-- it's pretty close to the design of armor the guards were wearing on the actual bridge itself it's just completely polished down here in the middle of a dank sewer it's delightful decoration it's about 40 feet up from you guys the path continues across the cistern deeper into the city beyond the cistern the tunnel continues after it converges who's leading this expedition now piglet go ahead and roll perception 19 okay all righty so as you go-- as you put your new shiny hat on and begin stepping forward across where the paths converge you-- big knees forward stomping steps and you put your head forward and stop as there's a distortion in the air before you and you breathe out huh and it (wobbling noise) quivers you make a perception check 14 you pull her aside there's nothing visible in the air before you you're wondering why she stopped and as you step forward you hit something at which point you guys watch as you suddenly notice there is a large cube-like creature made of some quivering gelatinous material as grizznak is slowly being pulled into it everyone roll initiative you can certainly try here we'll see how this works out for you all right so initiative rolls here oh man all right all right so initiative orders we have 20 to 15 what'd you get grizznak what did you roll it will happen every time all right so as you watch grizznak sucked into this giant creature you see it shifting and (squelching sounds) top of the round is browntooth browntooth what do you want to do on your turn all right go ahead and roll for attack that hits go ahead and roll damage so you move up there you can move five feet and do your second attack if you want to you're close enough that you can attack with both so what's the damage on the first one three damage all right 13 does hit it has a very low armor class because it is a giant cube so go ahead and roll damage nice all right so as you rush forward taking your five-foot step and attack with your first goblin cleaver you slice through part of its form then slice through with your second one as you cut each time you can see it leaves a giant opening and you cut a wedge out that (slurping noise) slops onto the ground and turns into a slowly liquefying piece of water the section that you cut out begins to slowly reform but however it does lose the mass that you cut of it so it appears to be having some sort of impact that finishes your turn browntooth mezek you're up however actually real fast 'cause this is part of the fun of it nope actually you're good you're up mezek sorry keeping track of the rules for the creature i haven't used gelatinous cube in so long technically you were okay go ahead and roll for the attack 16 hits go ahead and roll damage for the fist what is the save dc 14 it rolls a 14 plus-- plus nine yeah this cube is unaffected by your tiny goblin-- it does wob wob wob wob (laughter) so i'd say you moved into there you going to stay where you are okay so you step back it does get an attack of opportunity as you move back its giant pseudopod shoots out towards you that's a 12 what's your armor class no this is a general one 18 yeah as it (whoosh) out towards you you duck low with your quick goblin reflexes awesome that ends your turn piglet what do you want to do okay (laughter) 20 plus seven that hits go ahead and roll damage also grizznak i need you to roll a constitution save sorry a constitution base saving throw fortitude save well no it should say your second attack down is during raging all right there you go 14 points of damage as your hammer comes down wham hitting it stopping an inch from the edge of grizznak's face as he turns and watches from inside the whole thing shakes from the impact you do 19 that hits again go ahead and roll for your bite damage as you go in and bite a chunk out of this giant gelatinous mass like it's dessert yeah so roll a d6 and divide by two yeah so that would be two two plus two plus three so you do five points of damage giant goblin maw bites into the side once again near grizznak's face as you pull a bit away immediately as you pull back the rage is in you you don't really notice the fact that your mouth has gone tingling and you've lost all sensation in your mouth as you blah drools out as she talks her lips are numb it's like blah blah blah (laughter) grizznak did you roll your fortitude save 11 okay okay you are currently paralyzed for eight rounds marisha and being engulfed by this entity it's actually caused all of your muscles to lock up and you feel that same tingling sensation as you glance over and all the little hairs that might be protruding on your body dissolve and part of your skin begins to peel away all right so finishing piglet's turn that comes to you snizzler what are you going to do no no he is fully engulfed by the entity right now you are right there by the way this is the opening this drops down about 20 feet and the water is pouring into that right behind you so be careful where you're stepping you can if you want to you want to go with it so you take a step forward you-- okay so you're going to step into there so you watch as this haphazard piece of metal shrapnel that's been matted together with pig feces and twine goes (sticking noise) and is now right in front of you as you see a little fuse going (sizzling) are you going to stay right there so it would probably be one two three we'll put you there as you do that and pull back another giant pseudopod goes (whoosh) out towards you and slams into the stone next to you but you go huh that's the least of your worries right now as you pull back there's an explosion sound as it bursts inside the cube so i want you to go ahead and roll for an attack on this just for the purposes of this 18 so yeah this is a direct hit on the creature so go ahead and do your firebomb damage to the cube 15 points of fire damage as it bursts on the inside you are paralyzed cannot make a reflex saving throw you take six points of fire damage from being in the blast radius of this thing oh good to know so the actual cube is also on fire due to the blast radius-- because of the size of your explosion too because it is the ten-foot i need both of you guys to roll reflex saving throws if you could yep d20 and add your reflex save 16 it's half damage right for that so both of you take three points of fire damage as the blast radius of this sends chunks of this creature sticking to the ceiling and slopping down you take none because you're a rogue you're like partially out of it right now with the blast radius but-- you're slightly exposed it's partially exposed and as you're there going (muffled screaming) it (sucking noise muffled screaming) closing around you slowly all right that finishes your turn now it is your turn you take two points of acid damage as it begins to slowly digest you from the inside all right so as you two are there right in front of it the thing begins reforming the front of it which is currently blown open from the bomb that snizzler left in there it begins to shift and slither towards both of you guys and intending to engulf you as well i need you both to go ahead and make reflex saving throws you don't know what the result is but do you want to use your song now what'd you get browntooth okay you dart out of the way into the groove here as it moves forward so as you duck as it begins to shift forward piglet in a moment of intensity staring into the face of this for the first time probably your entire life you're like i can die what what are you going to do all right go for it what's your song all right well done so go ahead and reroll your reflex the creature has now engulfed both piglet and you get pulled up right next to it jammed into the currently paralyzed grizznak i need you to go ahead and make a fortitude saving throw and as you're pulled into it trying to find your way through you get pulled into the thing and you feel like that same numb sensation all across which by the way your goblin song maybe missed a few vowels because of the blahlah but the rest of your body begins to tingle and you begin to fight against it and your body won't move your body's paralyzed for six rounds jammed up against-- however it does take another d6 points of fire damage from your bomb so go ahead and roll that if you could four points of fire damage all righty all right that brings us back to the top browntooth you're up you dodge to the side you see it engulf-- it is it moved this way and you sidestep and it's moving parallel to you okay so you move-- a pseudopod swings out towards you but you-- it misses you entirely as you dart backward with your crossbow loaded you take aim and go ahead and fire you've heard the term couldn't hit the broad side of a barn thankfully this creature is the size of a barn you manage to sink the bolt into it go ahead and roll damage you feel a slight bit of pain at your back as a bolt nips you in the butt but you can't do anything about it because you're paralyzed five points of damage all right you guys can see the creature's shaking and shimmering as it's moving forward it's having a hard time keeping its form together it's looking really rough as it's slowly dissolving your two friends all right that's going to go ahead and bring us to mezek no because you are sober-- you require a full round action to do flurry of bros (laughs) you are two squares away from it so in order to get into it you would have to do a full round action go for it 13 hits go ahead and roll damage seven points of damage-- how do you want to do this okay you guys watch as mezek goes batshit insane on this cube smacks into the side manages to hit a core of its form where some of the bones are floating inside from previous victims probably the shiny things you saw earlier the person that once wore it bits of them are floating inside as it begins to collapse on itself like an order of cold flan and as it liquefies part of it pouring into the cistern the two of their bodies are starting to be pulled into the cistern with its form unable to keep shape okay you guys grab them pull them out onto the side the last bit of the flaming corpse of this cube sloshes into the cistern you wait about another minute or so before you both get your bodies back so as you're resting up from this do you guys need to do anything to heal up a bit no this is pathfinder girl sure i'll let you do that being the monk that you are 20 and with that with the various burn wounds on your body from the acid that's burned away and parts of the actual burn damage you've taken from the explosion mezek rushes in and like the roughest masseuse you've ever seen-- i'd say for that go ahead and heal four points due to the rhythmic massage of mezek's rough and tumble goblin hands yes yep that happened no however make a perception check 20 you have a jug it's mainly sloshing water and grime your usual-- what you like to sip on the way of your journey whatever you find along the way you guys are into this whole scavenging thing as you're thinking about this ah you didn't bring any alcohol you smell alcohol all of a sudden you guys watch as mezek darts down the path-- as you dart ahead you come to the edge and you can see there the path continues for another 200 feet before it dips off but you don't know quite where but the scent is strong here and you look over and you can see the wall to your immediate right actually has a fissure in it a part of it has cracked or a part of it has semi-eroded away and you can see the very distant dark glimmer of something beyond it go ahead and make a strength check eight you go and grab the stone you lift your whole goblin body up on it and start pulling you guys catch up and see mezek fighting with this wall and making no headway whatsoever (laughs) okay so you guys are just like double-pulling on it you make a strength check as well go ahead and roll an attack against the wall well go ahead and roll damage because you hit the wall outside of a critical fail you're fine yes a normal d10 plus-- you're not raging so that would be a plus four five points of damage as you guys are pulling the hammer comes down as piglet smashes into the side of this wall the stones crumble inward and you both go flung forward into the darkness tumbling over each other before you both (impact noise) against the wall slowly slide down as you look around you're inside this darkened chamber glancing around you first off you immediately notice that there is a heavy smell of alcohol in this room which as you guys are getting hungry you look around this chamber you're in you see a sack of moldy grains small containers of salts and spices dried meats that are put on racks against the wall casks and bottles of wine and ale all throughout this-- you guys go nuts devouring everything grabbing at meat filling your bellies you'd be welcome to fill your jugs with alcohol-- do you clear out your jug first or are you just going to add to it all right cool for the circumstances here you heal one hit point from the food-- i will say if you want to go ahead and tear into that moldy grain that might heal you a little more but it looks like your stomach might have a rough time with it do you want to go for it you get on top of that moldy grain you tear into it you destroy it-- as you go ahead and focus over on the wall you hear this rumbling in your stomach go ahead and roll a fortitude saving throw well the good news is you heal three additional hit points as your goblin metabolism takes in the horrible moldy grain the downside is you then vomit up all the moldy grain and you lose the hit points okay secretly so nobody else sees it or-- make a sleight-of-hand check (laughs) as everyone else is marveling themselves at this display of goblin gluttony you step backwards and somehow in the process of giving your fellow goblins a little bit of a head nod you have managed to fill all of your pouches and pockets with every single piece of meat on that wall it goes from full to empty in a second and no one's the wiser you got like saddle bags filled with food right now and no one seems to have noticed as you guys are finishing this mountain of goblin gluttony we're going to go ahead and take a quick break here we'll be back here in a few minutes all right we'll be right back [break] okay you gather a couple of bottles of wine you not really being able to read the labels gather what seems to be alcoholic and functional all right while this is happening does anyone want to do anything else here okay you roll around in it and you feel like it'll give you sufficient protection against a light wind you can hear the footsteps and what sounds like voices from upstairs there is a ladder in the far edge of this room that leads up to a trap door and when the trap door is closed you can hear what sounds like the occasional chuckle voices that are muffled through the wood it appears that there is an actual tavern above you on street level that has a handful of patrons in it sure ten i mean there's the path you can keep going or there's the tavern which as a note you guys currently have no idea where in this city you are you're just in the sewers okay you guys climb outside of the section of the broken wall and continue down the path (chuckles) okay okay you see the flare begin to slowly cause an ember to burn at the edge of a burlap sack of some spices in the corner all right you guys continue to walk down this pathway in the sewage system for about another 100 or so 150 feet it slowly pinches into about a five-foot-wide tunnel you guys can stand shoulder-to-shoulder two at a time at your goblin size to get across and the little bit of water that is coming through here from the rain runoff from some of the upper grate areas that are pouring in it seems to be running to the edge and you stumble a ways ahead before you find out that there that drop-off that you noticed you come up to it and it is indeed a drop-off you glance down and the walkway you're at ends abruptly around a large cylindrical cistern-type chamber probably a good 80 feet across and about 80 feet down further than your vision can really see you don't see a bottom of it you see (water falling) you spit out the loogie make a perception check you get so caught up with the flow of the loogie that you keep leaning forward further and further trying to figure it out as your heels lift up you guys watch as grizznak suddenly tips forward and goes over the edge this would be a straight up i would say dexterity go ahead and roll a dexterity check on this one to see if you can be fast enough to grab oh you're not helping you're watching 20 okay piglet reaches forward and goes over too as they both begin to tumble over the edge you grab and you both slip forward the three of you manage to grab the back of piglet and pull her up and slowly you guys get back up into the tunnel no no no piglet managed to grab the very back of grizznak and pull him back up grizznak you're really frustrated because you swear you were this close to seeing when that thing would drop before you got pulled up okay make a perception check you glance upon the sides of the stonework on the inside of this giant cylindrical cistern that leads up to the where all the water's pouring in from glancing about there are very very sparsely set stones that are slightly more protruding than the rest you gather they could be leapt from stone to stone if one is so interested in being a good climber so there is a way yeah mezek ties the rope around who gets the other end of the rope okay piglet you have one side of the rope now okay because there isn't a lot of-- roll a strength check 12 so you swing him around once before you realize that because you're up against a wall there's not a whole lot of space and (impact) into the stonework you take one point of bludgeoning damage hitting the side as he slips down and then is now dangling and you can pull him back up there's a big gap in mezek's grin as a tooth is now missing from that looking across the way you can see there is another opening 80 feet across you can try extract okay what is normal-sized snizzler shrinks down to about half the size now voice is higher appearance is ridiculous you guys now all can't help but chuckle at this snizzler you immediately regret this decision a natural 20 so you take this tiny goblin lick your grimy finger feel the wind point sir ruth style and shotput snizzler arcs forward much farther than you expected overward you see in the distance-- rope not attached by the way over it comes up and you can see you may or may not be close enough to the ledge oh god it's right there before you go ahead and make an acrobatics check in the middle of the air to try and maneuver yourself in the air to catch-- 12 it's up to you if you want to let it go you can sing your song and go for a reroll go ahead and reroll that acrobatics check so piglet you had this this isn't your fault stupid bomb goblin can't catch a ledge but you like you cross your arms and look around just so everyone else understands that it wasn't you (splashing) into the water below i do need you to make a swim check so you're treading water and slowly making your way across this giant cistern about 20 feet below where they are you get halfway across splashing you guys see snizzler trying to make her way over to where you guys are roll another swim check to try and make it the other half of the way 13 you make your way up to the edge like (grunting) you guys can look down now and you can just barely see outside of your darkvision here you see snizzler approach and is now treading water at the bottom of the cistern below you yeah you go over and reach over and you grab a rock and pull onto it and pull your weight up and your fingers slip off of it there is a slick liquid from general grime okay the rope (thumps) into the water next to you you grab onto it and the rest of you guys slowly pull snizzler back up onto the entranceway currently it is a dome a smooth stone dome that then has three openings where the rainwater is pouring into currently and filling the bottom of the cistern okay go ahead and roll a climb check 18 as you pull yourself up (grunting) and it is a slight curvature so you're like hanging and holding onto it but in true goblin tom cruise fashion keeping a stern expression on your face makes sense hopping on the sofa as you pull yourself up tiny goblin feet dangling below keeping your focus browntooth you bring your way across the ceiling carrying that rope in your grin you get up to the edge of where the water's currently pouring into the cistern and it's moving past i need you to roll another climb check to try and keep holding nine your fingers are starting to slip you're starting to slip yeah you know what for a-- yeah let's see if we can what's the spell this is open yeah there's no resistance to it as you're slipping slipping all of a sudden the grate that contains the water opens and actually slams into your side but you manage to catch onto it it knocks the wind out of you but you manage to hold on the edge you catch your breath and you realize this is first off holding your weight and second there's a number of cross iron bars that are all welded together that would be a good place probably to tie the rope off in climbing up the side of the grate however going on the other side you are now fighting against the torrent of water so i need each of you to make a climb check you don't have to you can stay back in the sewers we'll say for the sake of brevity here an additional hour or so is spent perpetually retrieving your allies who keep getting all the way up and then (splash) right into the water but you have to admire the tenacity okay so you get your ki point going eventually you guys make your way up past the flowing of water which has slowed now and that's probably how you're able to do it yeah you make your way up into an upper sewage system and you guys crawl through what is a much smaller series of pipes to the point where you as goblins still have to crawl to make your way through the sludge is thicker here and what little bit of rain is pouring through you manage to keep between your arms and legs eventually you find your way into the bottom of some sort of a chamber that is filled with apparently human waste okay like the finest of candles it does catch fire and begins to burn slowly it's not dry enough to catch-- we're having this conversation it would need to be suitably dried out to work as proper fuel but-- all right make a perception check all right while you're collecting your filthy prize both piglet and grizznek you guys look up and notice that there is a wooden or stone ceiling but a singular opening above you like a circular hole make a perception check you listen and you hear the muffled noises of conversation as well it sounds like there are a few different voices though they're behind a couple of walls from where you are no okay you cast open the opening is open (laughter) as you pull yourself up out of it in a wonderful medieval version of the ghoulies vhs cover you pull yourself out from-- oh man i couldn't go near toilets for years because of that movie cover at the vhs store there you go glancing ahead your open spell missed but did hit the front of the outhouse which has currently swung open in the mid-day facing the window leading into the tavern that you guys nearly entered beforehand closes shut however it does appear to be nestled in an alleyway on the outside of it it's a very thin opening you didn't see any people actually in the alley you saw the outside of a window and a street thoroughfare all righty so as you-- okay go ahead and roll a stealth check if you could all right as you stumble into the shady alley looking about you glance over the side of the window real fast into the tavern and you do see there are probably a dozen patrons in there some drinks being served a guard at the door on the inside however looking to your left there the alleyway spills out into a main street thoroughfare and you can see people walking by families with children there's a general air of jovial energy to it and some people are wearing flower crowns on their heads you can see carts being put along the street seems like the festival you were told of this terrible human festival seems to be in full swing go ahead and make a survival check you come out to the edge of the alleyway glance about first thing you notice is the sun in the sky you were like eh it's probably mid-day-ish no it's pushing toward sunset now you probably have another hour of sunlight so you don't know how much longer this festival's going to be going you spent quite a while getting here and wandering the sewers indeed however you notice that everyone is walking a certain direction and one there are a number of carts that are going by there are currently unmanned closed carts that would be used to sell fruit and fish this being a port town fish is a big export here and the alleyways that you came out of there is a second alleyway that offshoots from where the outhouse is that goes between the buildings off the main thoroughfare this is what you're able to gauge in your time out here you glance over the window and look inside one of the bar patrons sitting by the bar is this rotund-looking gentleman in his late 40s balding hair a double chin leaned forward on the bar looking like he's ready to pass out from the amount of alcohol he's been drinking he is in the inside of the tavern he has a very long coat that drapes past the bar glancing in there you see probably ten patrons altogether you do not have penumbra because he cast it on her right or is it a once at a time thing or can you do multiple people we'll say for the time being it affects both of you it's fine using the shadows around you it's getting late the angle of the sun shadows are not too hard to find roll stealth checks all three of you as you make your way along the side darting between barrels and trying to find a way into the tavern from the window other than the front door woo you guys duck behind every single possible piece of discarded material empty crates and boxes barrels that are available you jump at certain times following the lead of browntooth you manage to find your way through the thoroughfare to an entrance to the kitchen on the side of this tavern the door is partially ajar you look in and there is one person manning the kitchen you see this poor older woman who is in the process of running around with four things burning and is like there's too many i hate festivals coming she's not paying attention to the door right now you could try she seems largely distracted you guys with your current stealth not an issue you make your way through the kitchen unnoticed you make your way into the tavern proper you can see a handful of patrons around a table playing cards talking to each other you hear a couple of them one person's like stupid tradition i'm just going to stay here and drink until i care takes a big old sip somebody on the other side of the table goes speeches every year speeches father zantas has shown that religion has no sense of brevity you see this other guy at the far end table gets up and what about you zed and slaps the shoulder of the guy who has the large coat on he's leaning forward and goes at least the meals were good i'm probably going to skip out on the consecration i've no stomach for prayer these days he's face down on the bar right there oh zed that'll be me in an hour he goes and sits down at the table there's just the barkeep at the bar who's close everyone else is at the table now at the card game and zed is passed out at the bar what are you going to do no he's not wearing blue he's wearing a dark muddy brown color all right the three of you guys going into this tavern area go ahead and roll stealth again cannot roll perception for npcs today at all you guys dart under one table wait for a moment the barmaid walks by dart under another table you're chaining your way across this room between these men eventually finding your way right to the outside of this passed-out zed whose arm drifts and hangs loosely to his side his body is half against the bar and is a good two minutes from slumping directly onto the ground and off his stool the barkeep is like you okay zed pokes him a little bit he's all right goes back to cleaning a mug yeah you're just waiting (creaking) (slamming) you can only see the coat on him right now because it's a long trench coat what do you throw there is a shelf of bottles mezek you pull out your goblin jag star which is essentially the equivalent of a shuriken but it's carved out of pieces of odd rusted metal that had been tied together it's more of a cluster of broken whatever you found from a wagon wheel that was busted weeks ago but you throw it as a ranged weapon roll an attack 20 a bottle shatters and sprays across the back of the barkeep who's like hey what the hell is that he seems currently distracted the three of you together make sleight of hand checks right now as you rush up to try and pull this off this is probably me sorry so you guys aren't trained in it so this is going to be a basic roll adding your dexterity modifier okay you're all above a ten with two high rolls that's good you all leap up real fast grab his coat and pull it off of him before anyone seems to notice you glance and there is a belt pouch there roll another sleight of hand check this is another sleight of hand 15 okay you snatch it and all of a sudden you hear a voice from the front door go hey what's that i saw something is someone trying to steal from zed you hear footsteps as somebody begins walking over to where he was right now you guys run make stealth checks guys you have the coat with you yeah okay you guys run as you're running piglet you're running behind them hanging on the back of the coat and you slam your head at the bottom of the table putting a big old knot on it it happens to be the table where the card game was being played all the cards go (crashing) all the coins scatter in the air the guys go whoa what the hell is that and they see as this coat scampers off into the kitchen on its own you guys hear voices go did you see that it went in the kitchen come on you hear the sound of chairs scooting as all of a sudden people are beginning to stand up and rush towards the kitchen after you you're holding the knot on your head you pull the jar pour it out and spill this slick mass of goblin vomit and whatever else liquid you put inside there as you dart through the kitchen the cook goes your food's ready what the-- and sees you guys dart out the door as the crowd comes in and two of them (yell) and fall on their backs immediately there a third man steps over and follows you into the alleyway the cook's like you can't be in here what are you doing as the door slams you guys make your way into the alley you see the three of them rush out holding the coat as the door opens again you see this breastplate-adorned guard of the city who is essentially the bouncer of this place rushes out blade drawn helmet half-cocked on his face where it doesn't fit right and one eye looks higher than the other and he goes you (explosion) as smoke fills this entire alleyway he begins coughing you guys rush out of the alleyway you get out of the fog you manage to dart off to the side and wait a little bit you hear that guard wander off and start shouting and vanishes in the distance after a few moments of waiting you're pretty certain he hasn't been able to keep up with your trail because you're that stealthy are you going to do this this is the best goblin voltron ever in the pouch you find eight gold pieces a small snuff box okay roll a will saving throw 16 okay the world gets a little funny for a bit and you feel exhilarated though a little unfocused what normally is the goblin adhd is now in hyperdrive you're looking everywhere we have grizznak as the head you guys are the middle marisha and with that you stand up coat goes on snapping it shut so where are you guys going it was yeah you follow that great the sky has cleared by the way okay so (laughs) i'm so happy right now as you guys trudge down the alleyway the sky is clear now most of the upper areas are dry other than a few rain barrels that have caught a lot of water in the side of this alleyway you can hear the music in the distance you can hear the laughter of children you can hear people playing it sounds like this festival is in heavy swing you come to the end of the alleyway into an open town square a main open thoroughfare with large tents that are erected with large carts people barking for food different carnival games set up throughout this area what you notice amongst the buildings and houses is a large stone cathedral that looms over this entire area in front of this cathedral there is a raised platform where the band is playing where the music's coming from people all around this area are now talking and families laughing there are small poles that are erected that are covered in flower wreaths that are hung around it actually quite happy and jovial people are gathered towards the center of this area around that okay as this is happening a drunk man 30-something a red chin-strap beard and long hair pulled into a top knot has a tankard in front of him and (hiccup) hey happy autumn's-thing make a bluff check he goes i think you need some more of this than i do he pats you on the back with a hefty arm since you are the guys that are holding the legs right now i need you to both make strength checks five one leg whoa goes forward and you stumble and take a knee like you're kneeling in the middle of the street and the man who holds the drink goes-- oh you're one of them church types never mind and the guy stumbles off at this point you see the crowd starting to hush a little and gather towards-- you get back up make a perception check if you could grizznak 17 glancing up you can see now-- the people that are gathering towards this central platform area you can see a person ascending the steps on the side what you see is a man dressed in simple but elegant blue robes that walks from the cathedral who is standing now at a podium in the center of this as people begin to hush some yell towards him he has short brown hair and a well-kept beard that show a social station amongst the townspeople although his demeanor is very humble but some people are paying attention to him some people are looking around some people are still yelling and playing games he seems to be a little frustrated that no one's paying attention you do not see a stone however as you guys begin to make your way through the crowd and everyone's paying attention to various things in the area he reaches into the pocket of his robe and pulls out a small cast iron pellet about that large and he takes it looks around and throws it to the top of this platform as it hits the woodwork you hear a sudden (thunderclap) it causes this echo of thunder throughout the entirety of this area and everyone stops and goes (gasp) you have not actually for you go ahead and roll a wisdom check you realize at this moment as you were instructing the goblins that can't possibly be the stone because that's a boom-boom rock you realize holy shit this entire journey was to retrieve a boom-boom rock with this suddenly you hear screams you hear dogs starting to bark in the distance and you see the glow of flames over across the way as two streets three streets away you see fire beginning to glow and plumes of smoke build up people begin to run and chaos breaks in the crowd as people begin looking about screaming what's going on we're under attack goblins are here no all you see is the single stone rolling off the top of the stage-- okay you mage hand and the stone stops there in place as you begin walking towards it the crowd now is scattering and running away as people are trying to flee from this distant flame you hear another explosion in the distance as a section of burning wood flips okay so as you throw another firecracker you guys stumble forward foot by foot i want you to make another bluff check and i want both the legs both of you guys to make another strength check to try and get there quickly okay okay so as you're rushing forward you can see the crowd look at you as you turn and be like no don't go that way the goblins are that way and they're actually genuinely trying to save you and as you say that the firecracker goes off behind everyone looks around distracted as both of your legs tumble forward and you tumble forward the coat unravels as what was once a single entity rolls into five goblin balls that all (rolling thumps) across the stonework slamming into the base of this platform you guys can hear the distant screams of goblins two or three streets over where the main battle's happening the guards have moved in that direction this open thoroughfare is mostly empty of all people at this time you glance over and can see the stone is in the center of a light piece of mud that hasn't fully dried from the earlier storm you rush forward grab the stone and put it in your hand you hear a voice say halt you will walk no further foul creature sarenrae's vengeance will end your existence you all glance over to the left of you and you see a woman dressed in gold armor and light blue cloth clutching a scimitar in one hand and a small gold statue of a winged woman in the other as she glares at you you hear a voice behind her say come on kyra don't think we'll let you have all the fun to yourself you see walking up behind her a small halfling man grinning with shaggy blond hair saunters up pulling out a flute behind him a human in heavy armor his long brown unkempt hair around his shoulders draws two blades and scowls goblins of course he readies himself as a shield appears before him as another heavily armored figure steps in front of the lot a tall woman wielding a longsword her hair pulled back tight and her face tense goes behind me we shall smite them where they stand behind all of them you see an older man with long white hair and a beard hold up a staff and smirk well seelah i can just destroy them from here that's fine with me i need you all to roll initiative all right hold on just a second 20 higher than 20 anybody damn look at that all right that's browntooth you had-- these humans look ready and eager and there's a part of you that's like oh man it would feel good to cut them down it is up to you what you want to do 20 to 15 anybody sorry 20 to 15 nope all right 15 to ten nope ten to five top of the round all of them charge into the square as the rest scattered bring this in here browntooth you're up first closest place to hide here would be behind this cart or behind the platform they're right here you duck around here go ahead and roll a stealth check to hide in the shadows 13 30 okay you duck underneath the platform keeping an eye on what's happening is that your turn you can see them snizzler it's your turn right there all right he is 25 feet away do you want to get a little closer to do it lob it roll for an attack 18 hits it is a touch attack correct he's actually on fire right now indeed what's the dc on that that is a failure success success three damage three damage and six damage nice 13 points of damage woo sure that's about as far as you can get right there you run up fling it and dart away as it lands at the foot of the guy with the blades out he prepares himself and goes to guard as it (explosion) bursts in front of him you can see the flames coast up and now the fire is caught into his hair and his armor is burning from whatever goblin liquid napalm-like material you had in there adhered to him as the fire bursts outward in a ten foot radius because of your goblin expertise with explosive devices the flames catch the three other allies of his who all manage to avoid most of the impact but you do see them scarred and burned a little bit from the side of the blast the fighter is furious as the flames lick across his torso that ends your turn piglet you're up you are an up-close and angry-- yes you rage you can move 40 feet because you're a barbarian so you can go pretty far where do you want to go that guy you can get right up to him you (yells) rush up hammer in the air you get one hammer attack on this turn 17 just hits his armor class is 17 go ahead and roll damage on that yep d10 13 points of damage as you rush up to the man that's on fire you leap into the air (yells) and plant your goblin skullbreaker hammer right square in the chest you can see his armor bend inward and he goes (gasping) as the air escapes with a spatter of blood that crosses your face it's warm and you take it in as you pull back the hammer the flames still burning on him he's coughing up blood now from the impact he's already taken a very poor round that ends your turn angry piglet's up front first and foremost the little halfling bard shouts out to the rest of the group valeros you okay bud all right let's do this great and he jumps up onto this cart right here and pulls out his flute and begins singing and as their footfalls to the ground the strength and mighty muscles bound they raise their blades into the sky and cut those goblins nigh and high as he begins to sing he bolsters all his allies in song you see all of them begin to rally themselves for the battle hearing their friend accompanying this rousing fight that finishes his turn they all have bonuses to their combat prowess the paladin who watched her friend get pummeled in the chest and set aflame goes not on my watch and steps in to you and is going to take a swing with her longsword would you consider yourself an evil character she's going to attempt to smite evil as her swift action that's a natural 20 i have to confirm to see if it crits that is a 17 what's your armor class 19 it does not confirm crit however you do suffer-- that's eight points of slashing damage as the blade strikes into you and a burst of divine energy as you feel your dark core of your blackened goblin heart all of a sudden burn with radiant divine energy that ends her turn next up this older wizard dude is going to look to the one who threw the bomb and goes (casting) and holds aloft his staff you put out your giant goblin ear to listen to the strange language a pock of greenish energy forms in the air as an arrow streaks towards you what's your armor class 17 okay as this arcane arrow full of acid streaks towards you you do a goblin cartwheel out of the way and it hits a barrel behind you it begins to melt the barrel and you can see a thick series of berries begin to spill out onto the thoroughfare he goes oh damn it he ducks into this alleyway between those buildings here that ends his turn the cleric now is going to step up to the center holds her scimitar in one hand and her holy symbol to the sky and goes sarenrae protect us energy drifts off all of her allies heal up six hit points you also heal six hit points because you are a living creature and you're in the radius so you heal six unintended consequence of her circumstance the fighter who's on fire is going to grin and bear the flames because he wants to take down the one who smashed him with the hammer he's going to take another 1d6 fire damage go ahead and roll for that however he is angrily going to unleash upon you with his longsword and shortsword that is 13 to hit with his longsword what's your armor class you duck out of the way he goes in to stick you with a shortsword that's an 18 can't seem to find you with his blades as he angrily swings outward grizznak your turn there yeah you have the movement i'm okay with this what are the rolls you have to make for that one what'd you roll are you kidding me that's what happens is it called fire sneeze or flaming sneeze based on the effects of this spell i need you to-- roll a reflex save seven go ahead and roll 2d6 of fire damage as you glance over at the wizard wink go to sneeze and suddenly you catch yourself close the mouth as you sneeze there is a ball of flame that bursts out of the nostrils and ears of grizznak as smoke pours out (yells) and falls onto the back (sizzling) unconscious but smoldering at the moment negative one mezek you're up yes mid-run you throw a star using your deadly aim 18 hits go ahead and roll damage with the additional plus two damage for the deadly aim as you rush up you throw it it embeds in the side of his throat and he's like (coughing) he reaches up and pulls it out and a gout of blood goes (spraying) he's like (grunting) holding his longsword in one hand stupid goblins as the flames are still burning around him you move all the way up to him ending your turn we're back up to the top of the round browntooth you're up they have no idea you're hiding right there there's the paladin and there's the cleric there that's the bard go ahead and roll for attack yeah that definitely hits go ahead and roll damage with additional 2d6 sneak attack damage seven points of damage to the cleric the bolt strikes the back of the cleric's lower torso the kidney area and she goes (grunts) and almost drops the holy symbol catching it in the middle of the air looks around make a stealth check to see if you manage to remain hidden this round 26 she glances around and doesn't know where it came from and is like (grunts) are you going to move or are you going to stay where you are that ends your turn snizzler you're up piglet you're on deck you lob it towards the cleric go ahead and roll for an attack what'd you roll yeah 12 that's going to miss it's going to land right there minimum damage on that is six i need a reflex save from piglet and from mezek all right that's six damage to all of them you take six fire damage you take three points remember your maximum hit points went up to what your rage score is whatever it says as you're raging your hit points are up higher keep that in mind all right that ends snizzler's turn you're up no but because you're raging and you're in base to base with them you can attack and bite go ahead and roll with your normal attack natural 20 roll again to see if you can confirm critical roll another d20 plus nine that's a critical hit what's the damage multiplier on that it should have a multiplier next to the weapon roll 3d10 yes plus six 3d10 plus six damage yeah how do you want to finish him off because you destroy him so the man who's on fire in front of you with his two weapons out how do you want to finish him off he's (heavy breathing) the bard you swing as the fighter goes to parry your blow your goblin rage gets you a faster speed than he ever expected as he goes to swing it to the side the hammer comes straight across from the direction he wasn't expecting like an unintentional feint his eyes goes wide for a second before the hammer (slams) and the head gets carried off of his shoulders it spins backwards and the bard who's singing his song looks up as his friend's head towards him falls onto his feet and goes (yells) makes a concentration fails his concentration i'll say the song ends he has to start it again because he just saw his friend's head land at his feet he goes valero you you can see there is a genuine horror and sadness in his face yes you do this is the paladin right here go for it roll for attack 13 oh the paladin yeah it definitely misses the paladin her shield's too big you go to bite her and she slams the shield out and you catch metal instead she pulls the shield away and you scrape tooth marks against the metal which is impressive for a goblin she looks at you and goes you you foul terrible creature you will pay for what you've done you see tears in her eyes that ends your turn the bard is too angry to even consider-- no no he's too angry he's not going to be able to do his bard performances this turn he's too fraught with frustration he's going to cast sleep as part of the sleep spell just to double check what the saves are i believe it's a will save there we go we got sleep give me a second guys i need you to make a will saving throw you get plus two because you're raging with that you look over as the bard ends up singing this incantation in a language you don't understand you feel a wave of sudden sleepiness hit you one of your eyes begins to sag and then you (grunts) shake it off foam forming at the corner of your mouth the bard goes (yelling) unaffected by it that ends his turn the paladin friend is gone cannot do anything yet is going to angrily move this way to begin a pincer movement and is going to power attack you that is a natural 20 see if it confirms with a natural 18 i'm pretty sure that hits that's times two on that you take-- it's not too bad you take 12 points of damage as the sword streaks down cleaving off part of your ear and ends up embedding in your shoulder you look over grab the sword and pull it out and throw her backward she's caught off guard by how this tiny thing has so much might that ends the paladin's turn there we're going to bring us to the cleric the cleric is going to see how rough this is circumstantially she is looking over at the bombing one moves over here turns to you and goes you will set nothing more ablaze creature i need you to make a will saving throw as the hold person takes effect your muscles lock up as you're reaching for a bomb (grunting) you just can't move you see a grin across the cleric's face that's what i thought ending the cleric's turn the fighter is gone boom grizznak you're down to negative two go ahead and make a fortitude save 20 i'll say for the sake of this you manage to stabilize you're no longer bleeding you're good that ending your turn mezek you're up you frog leap over the raging piglet and land go for an attack 15 hits she doesn't have a huge armor class which she rolls a five she does not yep as you jump over leap to the ground and then shoryuken-like upper fist to her chin you see a tooth go flying and her helmet gets set off she pulls back she drops the holy symbol in her hand which now hangs from a chain grabs at her head going (groaning) and is doubled over unable to gather her senses right now ending your turn there browntooth you're up paladin all right go for it roll the attack for that one you haven't used your song yet if you wanted what's your song go ahead and reroll that as you steel yourself locking in another bolt into the crossbow (singing) goblin songs are cursed i got you a sad trombone for you there as the crossbow bolt goes off somewhere into the skyline you're realizing perhaps the distance game isn't working for you might need to get up close and personal if you're going to land an attack here are you going to stay where you are the church is up here these are the steps to the church over here roll to see if you can remain stealthed all right ending your turn brings it to snizzler you're locked in place make a will saving throw to see if you can resist the effect of the hold person spell yeah unable to shake the effect you're still locked in place hand on the bomb you're looking down at it you were about to light it and your hand is hovering there and you're like (strains) piglet you're up you can both hammer and bite go for it that hits go ahead and roll the hammer damage 12 ooh as you bring up and slam the hammer down she pushes the shield up to block the blow but the mallet catches over the top the sheer weight of it pushes the shield away as it comes down and slams into the side of her chin you can see the jaw breaks from the impact a little bit of blood begins to trickle out of the corner of her mouth she's like (pained grunting) she spits a glob of blood across her otherwise pristine silver armor roll for the bite attack that also hits go ahead and roll damage roll a d6 halve that add three four points of damage as she's reacting from that and spits the blood out looks down you run up the side of her shield and bite into the chin you just broke and tear a chunk out of her face she's like (screaming) who does that that ends piglet's turn the bard whose spell has been less than active and the wizard who spent his last term in absolute horror of his friend regains his senses and is going to step up yeah the wizard hid off to the side and watched his friend get beheaded and spent the turn looking in horror the bard is going to attempt to cast sleep on you again make another willpower save 18 plus three once again shrug off the effect and he's like why won't you stay down stupid thing he's pointing his finger clutching his flute angrily in the other hand nothing is affecting you he's going to rush over to the side behind the cleric now and be like can you heal me please he's running off to the side and asking for a heal the paladin is going to as a reaction to you furiously swing at you with the longsword that is a 22 to hit that hits you take seven points of slashing damage as the blade streaks down across you you're still chewing the chunk of her face that's running around in your jaw but the blade goes across the front of your torso and leaves an opening that begins to spill dark brackish goblin blood you don't even feel the pain you're in such a furious bloodlust right now the wizard's going to step forward now going to go ahead and cast magic missile one arcs off at you while you're held in place one's going to streak off and hit you mezek you take two points of force damage snizzler you take three points of force damage as two missiles arc off and slam into the sides of you from the arcane nature of the spell that ends his turn the cleric can't do anything is stunned this round manages to shrug it off but has absolutely no way of using any of her abilities because of the fist in the face she got from mezek grizznak finishing that mezek it's your turn your last go for it so you are doing two punches or two hits with your quarterstaff stunning fist is as an attack you can have it be a stunning fist attack so roll for that see if it hits 20 that hits go ahead and roll damage on that rolls a seven six points of damage and she is stunned again quarterstaff clocks her upside the head now causing the armor to bend in on her temple and one eye has gone a little cross-eyed from the impact go for it 12 total bonus she is currently flat-footed with the armor that's still 14 so yeah 19 hits roll damage eight points of damage how do you want to finish off the cleric so after you slam her in the side of the head stunning her she leans forward from the impact you spin the staff in one hand and then do a golf swing up the side of the head you hit at such a way that you cause the bent metal of the helmet to act like a guillotine-like blade with a (boomp) her head up in the air rolls on the ground the bard who came up to ask for healing heal me heal me and the body slumps down on the ground in front of him and the head lands a second later and he rolls a one on his will save he is currently horribly shaken by this experience and is having penalties from watching his two friends lose their head in the same battle currently the bard yeah okay roll to confirm crit 11 i'll say with the penalties he has suffered from watching his friends die i'll say it just barely hits how do you want to do this to the bard as he is screaming the staff goes through bursts out the back of the base of the spine where the brain connects and goes (gurgling) blood dribbling down the side of his mouth you hold him aloft what do you do with the corpse at the end of the staff okay he is currently now held limp against your staff just being held aloft by your weapon absurd there is the wizard and the paladin and they are both looking around themselves and wondering how these goblins steamrolled their adventuring party as far as you know yes crossbow to the paladin go for it 19 hits what is the critical range on the crossbow does it just say times something so roll again to see if it crits go ahead and roll double damage on that roll 2d6 plus sneak attack so 4d6 damage total on this how do you want to finish the paladin how do you want to do this phil the paladin's back is to you bearing down on piglet now both bloodied and engaged in gladiatorial combat this tiny goblin meat shield and this shielded piece of human meat she does yes yeah as you aim carefully you wait for her as the blows trade back and forth between her and piglet after the hit she pulls back and spits off to the side and you can see the front of her face as her head turns back you use that moment to release and catch it right in the side of the helmet where the ear would be the bolt out one side and gets partially out the other she stands there for a second before (thud) to the knees face first on the ground in the mud snizzler make a will saving throw you know what the spell does break because the cleric's dead you regain control of yourself thank you for the reminder there's one wizard that rushed out of the alleyway like okay i can do this runs out and all of his friends are dead and his chin's quivering under his short gray beard it is your turn right there a cross between a bazooka and a large egg shell she jams the bomb into it as it detonates it sends out a wave of smoke and ash it blows apart and sets you on your feet from the impact of the launcher roll the attack it doubles the range that's just enough 18 does hit his armor with mage armor of 16 go ahead and roll damage on that that's 2d6 plus three plus 1d4 because of your explosive feat 11 points of damage and he is on fire as he looks over and is like my friends what (explosion) he's screaming on fire that's snizzler's turn piglet you're up leaping on top of the cart that is there before him go for it leaping in the air you go and swing with the hammer and because the flames are hot in your face you swing wide and end up smashing part of the cart instead he looks at you through the fire going no you have to be right up close to do that that finishes your turn piglet everyone else is dead the wizard is in the flames going no and put out his hands like this and a gout of fire like a flamethrower bursts from the arcane energies go ahead and roll d6 fire damage by the way go ahead and make a reflex save if you could you take six points of fire damage through the flames more flames come you burn the cinders what little bit of hair may have existed on you is gone you are a charred black mass of cracked goblin flesh and anger you're enjoying being on the edge of death that ends his turn no one else is alive you mezek you're up you're horrible you can use that we're going to consider this an improvised ranged weapon go ahead and roll an attack with your dexterity bonus as opposed to your strength bonus with a minus four because you're not proficient in ranged improvised weapons just melee ones what's your dex modifier roll a d20 and add three to it just your attack bonus 14 unfortunately misses you look through the flames he goes (heavy panting) and looks over as the bard head careens towards him and ricochets off his arcane armor he goes (screaming) your monk speed you get right next to him he's being surrounded now browntooth you can move this way you can get there and see him off to the side roll a stealth to see if he sees you he does not he is so distracted with all his dead friends and being on fire there's no way he can beat your stealth score with a six he rolled yeah you're fine go ahead and roll an attack 16 just hits go ahead and roll that is his ac with mage armor go ahead and roll 3d6 13 how do you want to do this on fire looking aghast at the heroes slain around him he's over there and he's like (heavy breathing) as he looks over up to the sky for the first time in his entire existence becoming a religious man at the cathedral the flames behind the cathedral from the mounting goblin hordes that are descending upon this square he goes why as the bolt strikes him right in the center his eyes go wide and slo-mo (thud) the flames (sizzling) consuming the rest of his body on the ground you guys can now hear the screams in the distance still growing louder you can barely see the shadows of the seven-tooth goblin horde coming down the mountain coming through the alleyway here you gain five hit points every corpse is marked appropriately with your victory token of the goblin dickbutt (laughing) roll an attack (explosion) you see an explosion as flames begin to burn up on the long tapestries that hang in the front of the temple inside you see two people that were hiding in the temple from the goblin hordes come running out on fire just as the goblin hordes round the corner and go (screaming) and rush and start striking them down stabbing them repeatedly with their blades the rest of the temple begins to catch flames as it licks out the sides of the now-shattering stained glass you nod your head proudly before you dart back into the sewer after your friends you guys your way out of what remains of the town of sandpoint heroes left scattered across the center of
