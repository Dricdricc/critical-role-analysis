to talk about before we jump into the game all righty that being the case then let's go ahead and hop into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] all right so vox machina taking your time to mourn in your own interesting ways what is your path of action what is your course going forward okay so you've all spent the majority of it in your respective rooms-- most of you in your respective rooms-- figuring out where you are as a person and where this story leads you after an evening's rest the next morning comes around breakfast is already prepared by the servants in the castle though maybe not the amount of bacon you were hoping and easily rectified upon request it's at your disposal there is a tension in the city the barrier remains up as you're having breakfast you can see zahra wander in at the smell of bacon glances over the rest of you still holding a book at her side that she slams closed oh i'm glad to see you're all right and you're safe please tell me there's more bacon she comes and sits down and spends breakfast with you guys catching up on what has transpired and what your current plan of action is kind of let's just say we're estranged at the moment you will find no allies where you're asking believe me i'd be happy to offer if we could but no it's all right i'm going to continue with my research since the rest of the ziggurat clan are now scattered about or maintaining that barrier guess who has to do the research in the meantime and she rolls her sleeves up you can see the slightly smudged dirt across her reddish skin she's been hard at work digging around trying to figure out what the basis of this enchantment beneath the city still is i'm certain time will allow me at some point it better i'm going a little stir-crazy she grabs the bacon from the table and walks out of the room i'm sorry what i haven't seen him for a couple days i've been underground most of the time it's actually a sigil by memory that he has and it's a spell that he casts it's not a permanent fixture in the city it's a renewal feature he has to spend some time each day maintaining it he's not stuck there the whole time roll an intelligence check that's what they look like they're huge most definitely they're nasty they burrow the actual blood within their body is heated to such a degree that even to be in a scuffle with it is to scar yourself with flame and heat you guys head outside of castle whitestone not far from the base of the pathway into the actual city you can see there is a series of newer-outfitted guards they are people being trained in the force of combat you can see that there's definitely a ramping-up of the defense force for whitestone as a precaution many of them look able-bodied and people that are strong and fit but they do appear to be civilians that have had to take up the cause just in case no kids no they all look to be at least of strapping age to be carrying a weapon as you are watching the group go through their different weapon practice moments they're breaking off into small sparring groups and they're going up against ramshackle built training dummies there are a few that are doing forms in succession (grunts) you know the deal you do see on the opposite end that the person who is currently helming one section of the training is kashaw you can see a bunch of shield and spear fighters right now and he's basically giving them instruction on how to use a shield defensively and the spear offensively simultaneously as you approach you see him leaning in with younger early twenties-looking men a bit scrawny they're still armored the helmet looks a little lopsided kashaw's like you're not supposed to put the shield away (sighs) oh wonderful take five take 30 so you're alive that's great i'm excited what can i do for you depends on where and what you'd have me doing so you're saying that i go back to frozen-ass vasselheim to deliver a paper message to the headmistress whom already i am so happy to be away from he glances over at the rest of the soldiers yeah i'll take it (laughter) i'll do my best to muster some semblance of emphasis all right give me a list of what you've got to offer i'll bring it to them make a check as you're having this conversation (whack) right in the knee cap a surprisingly painful and forceful blow it's less the strength behind it and more the precision in which it strikes you right between the kneecap and the rest of the lower half of your knee yeah and you're like (grunts) and you glance over and you see vax hide a wooden sword quickly behind him as he backs away roll a strength check actually this time it's an attack roll as well you're not proficient with a sword (laughs) you whack him this time it hits the meat of his thigh and has no effect okay roll an attack roll before this happens as you're getting up you watch as vax rears back and as he throws it (yelps) he pulls a muscle in his shoulder and it drops to the ground and you're like (pained noises) make a persuasion check you watch as roughly 45 armored soldiers all turn towards you with their shields and spears and freeze they all slowly look towards scanlan and whisper among themselves then look back at grog and stay frozen and two creep forward for a minute get a little closer as your form swells into your now enlarged goliath battle-ready form you notice a few of them start giving off this rattling metal sound as their armored knees (clanging) together many of them step back about ten feet and kashaw who hasn't left entirely spins around and goes the gnome's fucking with you it's fine he walks up to you scanlan pats your arm and goes that was pretty funny don't get the people killed i've been working on them for four days well we'll see go ahead and roll an attack roll roll a strength check okay roll again because he used a luck point to force you to reroll your attack roll what was the strength roll again strength check was 24 so as you peek out of the corner of your eye you hear this (heavy steps) and as you try and spin and dodge out of the way instinctually-- i know and we'll get to that instinctually you turn to dodge out of something grog-sized not giant-sized and in that brief minute that you remember that he grew you pause just long enough to (whack) feel the force of what feels like a giant battering ram slam into your side sending you off your feet and arcing a good 30 feet before you (impact) tumble and skid to the ground what's your strength modifier seven you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to half because you're taking uncanny dodge so only seven points bludgeoning damage you stay there for a second stunned you feel a bit of bile and iron taste in the back of your throat (laughing) make an investigation check they appear to have maintained their composure as gauntlets you watch as a lot of the soldiers who had been watching this endeavor step even further away from grog and some of them begin walking off taking their helmets off all right we're done they all nod their heads yeah i know that thank god but they're all doing this while still locking eyes with him that's great and slowly walk off a portable writing desk you have access to a quill and ink you have access to parchment you have access to that yes all right yes you have access to that he has a spell for that (laughter) as you finish penning the letter you read over it once twice make sure all the information is contained you go ahead and grab the little bit of your offering of dragon scales and teeth present them to kashaw he takes the letter and reads it over sure are you going to do your tree thing for me otherwise i can walk but it'll be a month and a half before i get to shore i'm can figure something out (chuckles) no all right gets his shield and his spear and walks down with keyleth towards the sun tree as he's walking down at your side as he walks with you down the pathway having this conversation it's that awkward quiet about three four minutes of walking before he goes (sniffs) ugh so when all this is over-- if we survive all this dragon business-- do you want to get a drink good great you guys begin to approach the edge of the tree he goes i think you answered your own question is that a yes open the damn tree yeah it doesn't work out for anybody trust me all right then we'll just-- hey and you push him through the tree shuts behind him you're left there alone standing in the cold whitestone air outside of the sun tree around mid-morning all right you guys make your way towards the building that has recently been essentially given to and is acting as the abode for shaun gilmore while he's here in whitestone as you come to the front door the door's closed you knock (knocking) no response you hear a muffled voice in the distance within the building go yeah hold on it sounded like gilmore he's under some sort of duress slightly yes hold on please and you watch as the barrier flickers for a second and restores itself almost like a wave of energy brought what was a slowly dwindling bit of the blue energy now restored to its full strength a moment passes before the door opens again and you see gilmore there beads of sweat down the front of his face he's got his fuzzy purple-blue robe wrapped around him my sincerest apologies i had to take care of the now morning ritual i'm fine this is child's play compared to what you're having to deal with on a daily basis i'm sure go for it 15 what can i do for you well at the very least that gives us a series of days to make the best of the time we have so marquet it is all right come in he closes his robe a little bit and walks in and you enter you can see there's a half-drunken tea set and he begins to walk past tea anyone i'll do what i can currently there is one cup but as he walks by he does this with his fingers and you watch as multiple cups drift off the shelf and find their way (cups landing) on the table it looks a little disheveled but also it hasn't been too long since the assassination attempt on him and he threw his attacker into the far wall but it looks like the furniture has been placed up there are still some bits and pieces of broken things here and there but for the most part it doesn't look like he's had lot of time to clean up other than just making it functional it seems livable it's not too bad he goes into the kitchen he comes back out a moment later with a fresh pot of hot tea and sets it down all right so this isn't going to send you to where you're going-- it's hot it's dry bring some water if you can i should not got to keep this going until allura comes back best i can tell you because i haven't been there since i was very young one this going to send you not to ank'harel itself it's going to send you to shandal which is a small oasis village a little ways south of ank'harel it's where i grew up shandal i will say that it has been about 15 years so i don't quite know what to expect there i apologize in advance for any ensuing chaos but it's a nice town it's small it's sleepy it's not my speed hence why i came here however in marquet it's mostly music culture fun people good food don't break the laws don't drink the water freely from the various channels you may stumble across water there is a commodity it is controlled and sold throughout the city those are the main things i can think of i don't know what else you're really looking for there i don't know anything about that unfortunately but most folks that have information are eager to give what they know with a little coin to grease the palm depends on who you're talking to anything else he pours tea for everyone else who asked for it and for each person that asked for a different flavor of tea he begins to snap his fingers and the tea color changes there are many that would definitely probably narrow it down but none that i can remember off the top of my head when you meet them and you'll know who they are tell them i say hello and actually-- he thinks to himself for a second rushes off comes back with a small backpack made of leather and thick light tan wool he opens it up and reaches inside pulls out a small silver locket and takes it and puts it in your hand vex he goes just give that to them he closes the bag and places it back in the other room (sighs) we do what we must yes i guess if i had one request of all of you this goes universally can we end this dragon business soon please i really just want to set up shop again great good because i've been keeping a tally i don't know about you guys but the tab is running very deep fantastic i love it i'll be here if you need me all right you don't want the rest of your tea these didn't belong to me so please take them if you want (laughter) not that he'd tell me anything but he doesn't have a very lengthy period of keeping this up without him probably collapsing like he did back in the city just please try to do your best to get this over with i'm worried at the very least until allura comes back at least they can share the load all right she knocks on the door and opens it gilmore gilmore breakfast the door closes behind her it doesn't take you long he is still stationed as one of the central figures guarding the actual castle of whitestone itself similar to the place you saw him last time you guys had a conversation walking up to the castle he stands there with his crossbow at the ready giving a long view over the surrounding valley before he watches you approach friends you have returned i hope all is well on your end can i be of service it was maybe ten nine years ago and it was not under the best terms probably would be in jail had i not got away they are not very forgiving of broken laws there and based on certain judgments let's just say a slap on the wrist usually takes the wrist with it (sighs) whatever was needed for survival to ank'harel no (laughter) the cerulean palace the cerulean palace is where the hand of ord generally keeps most justice where most of the courts are kept it is also where the tower of j'mon sa ord is maintained for watching over the entire city and most of that eastern side of marquet the scarlet prison is where people go to disappear it is also referred to as the scarlet oubliette people are placed there to go away people are placed there to be tortured people are placed there rumors say to be part of various experiments regardless i would highly recommend-- he looks to you don't steal anything unless you are damn sure nobody knows of it he closes his eyes a second that was a very very-- not any merchant i know but this den you speak of they were a rather serious gang running rather violent activities in the city maybe 70 80 years ago in the outer walls the outer walls are solid they are thick they are meant for defense only i did not run with them i do not know anything it was before my time but they have not been around for at the very least 50 years it is j'mon sa ord j'mon i have not seen j'mon though i have heard the stories j'mon brought the city together 400 years before when it began to grow expand when it became this great oasis long ago it went into chaos and there were many who wished to utilize those who lived within the center desert to be abused to be swindled to be enslaved j'mon started the hand of ord which was the peacekeepers and really brought the town of ank'harel into the grand city it is today not known to appear in public very often there are many rumors that circulate some say that perhaps j'mon is some godling an entity that has existed long before ank'harel and will exist long after there is also-- and this is my personal belief-- i think j'mon sa ord is many people i think j'mon is more of an office a station a title that's passed on from person to person because i've heard referenced as a girl i've heard referenced as a boy they carry ornate armor of a deep blue sapphire color and brass shandal yes (laughs) it's more of a podunk comparatively yes ank'harel is immense shandal is usually a small stop in case camels or other horses have died in transit as well as a small water stop on the way to the city i'd say maybe a day's travel it is to the south-southwest of ank'harel oh emon comparable a bit bigger i don't recall i've met people missing many limbs and parts of their body kind of happens it' a dangerous place the deserts in marquet but there are also many people that live there i have no interest in titles i just wish to stay alive i'm sorry i am much more of use to you here i assure you i would be a perpetually nervous paranoid wreck if i were to come with you good we'll keep it that way yes for many long years yes the oasis is built around well most of it's controlled in the river district a number of canals begin in the river district this is where there is the spring the perpetual oasis that fuels the city and many of the caravans that travel to and from yes there is 'be pleased' with a small bow preferably with the hand down towards the stomach with the hand out be pleased to be honest anything you do will offend somebody in the right place right time but people are pretty laid back in ank'harel as long as you follow the rules it's a beautiful city i'm actually excited for you to see it i'm very proud of it had i not made some mistakes you know what if you can there is a special spice that is harvested not far from the city if you could find me some fusaka spice bring me a small-- not a lot just a bit it's for food yes it's a bit pricey i can give you some-- all right well i appreciate it (laughs) work on it for a bit maybe watch some folks you'll pick it up right quick just pay attention all right be safe friends look forward to your return that is my purpose is he all right i may have noticed it myself i will do this for you promise my pleasure all right you guys head back to gilmore's place you can pick up a few we'll say for about five gold pieces here you can acquire some jugs that are compact enough that they'll actually fit within the bag of holding should you place them the healing potions that were available in the city you guys have already taken five jugs she's so busy getting married or something percival presents you with a nice flowing light whitish-gray cloak ceremonial within older whitestone gatherings it seems nice it seems light you can totally place it over your displacer cloak all right what's the plan you close your eyes and concentrate and you see peeking out from the metallic rim of the sword which you gave her the aberration's bane longsword you look up and you can see the edge of a wooden table you hear faint music in the distance it sounds like some sort of a piano being played no accompaniment just a straight piano you hear distant whispers of conversation the occasional burst of laughter and you can see the edge of kaylie's elbow leaning against the edge of the table there's a long pause no movement then all of a sudden she shifts back from the table and goes that's right all the money on the table's mine nice try scoops down throwing her hand of cards on the table you hear a couple voices go (groaning) you see her scoop the coins over and go place them into a coin bag all right so perhaps another round then where are you going are you a coward or something shouting this in the distance as apparently the previous people she card sharked walk off frustrated and growling you see one of them comes up to the edge of the table and goes best be giving that money back little girl or you're-- before that happens you see a large meaty hand grab the back of his neck and pick up him by the scruff you see appear into view the very edge of dr dranzel's chin and hat and he goes i'm sorry were you talking to my lady friend that way that's poor manners and drops him there at the table the guy adjusts himself better not see you guys in the street he walks off she reaches her hand up watching the guy leave and fist-bumps dranzel your vision fades back and your consciousness comes back to you all right you guys make your way back towards gilmore's home at this point in time you come in and find there are a couple of plates crumbs to the side gilmore's sitting in the chair with his tea eyes closed in a meditative stance as soon as you enter the room he jolts back to momentary awareness all right gathered your things are you ready to go if you don't mind he grabs the edge of the central table in the center of the room with the tea on it he looks towards you you guys shift it move it to the side leaving an open space on the ground he kneels down and places one hand in the center of the floor the other hand he reaches back into a small pouch on his side and pulls out a small amount of shimmering glassy sand material you recognize as a hint of residuum processed into its dust crystallized form he scatters it around while he's muttering under his breath as he does with his hand in the center you see the dust pull together into these small symbols on their own almost like magnets to iron filings they're forming into these rigid structures as they do they begin to flare up and glow and he takes a step back his eyes still closed brings his fist together into a grip as he does they light up and you recognize this as a teleportation circle he goes all right it won't last long in you go my pleasure is the last thing you hear before you dive in as it begins to fade each of you guys step into and transition past immediately piling up into each other as you come out the other side as you're in a dark and enclosed cupboard or closet-type circumstance it looks like there is a set of doors to it it's a giant armoire you guys are pushed into it but it is latched over flick it up it bursts open and you all come stumbling out as you all stop vex you look back around this is a very large dresser-like armoire it's empty it looks like there are a number of hangers inside like it was a place for various outfits to be kept and stored on the floor of the wood you can see carved into it a small symbol or a sigil if you will sam and marked as the symbol he put glancing around you can see a small dark wood room atop a wine-red circular carpet in the center empty shelves and cobwebs fill the corners there's a bit of dust and sand coating over where the bed rests against the wall a closed window hides behind a drawn curtain with a little bit of peeking sunlight making its way through there is one single door that sees you out though it is currently closed step onto the carpet close your eyes how do you will it moments pass no effect the door is locked it is not trapped you're peeking out the window you said you glance through the cloth and it looks like it is a glass window but it is partially opened and looks like there's a little cluster of sand that's gathered over time underneath the sill from what little bit the wind's pushed through glancing out as soon as you push out the light is very bright and you have to take a moment for your eyes to adjust looking out you see a simple street there are some small buildings built of fine wood nothing too extravagant you can see a number of trees that protrude from the sand long tall thin palm frond-type tops to them bearing some sort of large nut-like fruit you can see what look to be small troughs of gathered water whether it be from rain or them placed there intentionally but they're currently locked with some semi-translucent top and chained shut on the outside of two of the buildings you do see a few people walking back up and down the street general civilians all dressed in longer full-body robes some of them with scarves around their neck i wouldn't say peasants per se but definitely not well-off in their appearance casual civilians darker skin looks like they've definitely been living in the desert for a long time that is what you can see from the window's point of view currently you're on the first floor you don't know looking under the bed you see what appears to be a small wooden box that is closed and hidden toward the very back and what appears to be a small series of shirts that have been folded up and have gathered a lot of dust over the top of them yeah pull them out really nice high-quality silk and cotton based embroidered shirts look more ceremonial special event type long maybe knee-length currently it's pretty bland you can see a couple of colored tapestries similar to the center of the floor rug that are hanging but there are a lot of blank areas it looks like decorations have been removed or at least haven't been there for a long time the room for the most part seems to be abandoned make an investigation check 14 it does not appear to be trapped you do open it up glance inside it looks to be a series of folded papers it's easy enough like butter (creaking door) the door opens as the door opens up immediately your nose catches the smell of sage and cooked meats as the door opens you look into a large room to your left with some furniture not too extravagant but nice and a humble living space as the door opens the other way you look to the right and you see two figures sitting at a table seemingly eating an older couple with dark sun-weathered skin graying hair and bright eyes they look confused and slightly scared at their table staring back at people wandering into the middle of the room they both look at each other they both look to each other and then immediately begin mouths filled with food laughing (laughs) this is unexpected friends of shaun's you say the man himself stands up and begins to walk over wiping the edge of his mouth with a small piece of cloth finishing chewing and swallowing the food he has currently as he walks up the man has thinning white hair that grows long straight down towards his back simple long robe-like dress with simple cloth pants that go round these slipper-like shoes on his feet he approaches which one said shaun gilmore and shaun approaches you as you stepping forward as one of the more you know assertive members of the party and goes how is he if you could please tell me opesa opesa come and the woman gets up from the table yes i'm sorry it has been a while since we've had guests from so strange and sudden arrivals she walks up and pulls these small glasses out from her pocket and puts them on you can see her eyes open up wide behind them and she comes leans to the side and puts her arm around him they both hold each other he goes i am sorry let me introduce i am soren geddmore this is opesa geddmore you know our son and you say he does well with his business this is good he has always been a brave one you don't have to embellish that's okay would you like to eat with us we can make more food yes you are going to ank'harel yes follow me he takes her by the arm and they both walk arm-in-arm leading you guys to what looks to be a front door of this abode as he pushes it open revealing more of the street of this small oasis town he goes let's see if you follow-- that is the sun he looks up and you see his eyes adjust to the brighter sky the sun is there it will be setting that direction continue what is the word you speak that is west you want to north so go that way yes that is where you want to go i haven't been in many years as far as i know there are signs there are not roads there are guides you could hire to bring you there you get the sense these are probably who he was referring to what-- and he looks to his wife the woman steps forward adjusting her glasses thank you so much she holds it and opens it up looks over to him and shows him you get a bit of a glance at that point you can see it's a picture of gilmore he's happy jewel-encrusted rings it's almost a promotional still if there was one for gilmore's glorious goods she takes it she closes it and goes gilmore is originally geddmore he changed his name when he went for better business to the tal'dorei place glad he's doing well give him our love and tell him he is more than welcome to visit it has been many years not a worry safe travels you're sure you don't wish to have food they both look at each other i'm not familiar with this spice you speak of my apologies she's like i'm sorry i do not know this fusaka you speak of we have around this way-- he leads you towards the back of this small kitchen it's very condensed you can see there is a high metal fence and there appears to be a rainwater receptacle there like a well that is built into the homestead it has chains over the top he begins to pull keys out and lock to it and as he pulls off the chains one by one he pulls back the lid this hard dry wooden lid and within it is a very deep well though it looks like the water level's maybe ten feet down from the top of the well right now hey opesa do you see anything and she blinks a bit no it's empty nothing you are a strange man (laughter) how much water does it create oh wow you are still a very strange man but i'm very happy and appreciative all right i can see now gilmore has his work cut out for him he pats your shoulder geddmore indeed as you finish pouring the water out they lead you guys back to the front he pulls out a small sundial from his pocket holds it up it would be closer to late afternoon well thank you so much for coming be pleased and they both in a very rusty joints way give you both a bow as you leave that would be the saddest tpk ever let's go guys and so ends the journey of vox machina (laughter) all right as you guys take a moment to concentrate each one of you transforms into mist as you begin to go one by the other you do hear a couple of (gasps) you glance over your shoulder to see three kids all looking up at you all with these big scared smiles make a deception check after you give your presentation they whoa as you begin transforming you do that and they go (terrified screaming) and go running indoors that's what vox machina is all about you are terrible people you guys rise into the air as the sun begins to bring itself to set in the west you shift up over the city you look down probably maybe 150 200 buildings make up the entirety of shandal it's not a very large town but you can see little dots of moving caravans both to and from the city it is a fairly lively stop for people traveling to and from ank'harel every now and then as you follow the direction they're going you're traveling much faster than they are the hot air does feel a little uncomfortable against your cloud-based misty forms but you do not feel like it's responsible for evaporating any of your form you're like oh this is uncomfortable you continue to press forward as the sun slowly begins to set the temperature begins to get colder and colder and the sky grows darker if you'd like to it's up to you entirely the form is your choice you continue to travel throughout the night yes you guys cruise you guys push forward for another four to five hours post-dusk you're now hitting the early hours of the morning before you begin to see in the distance hundreds of sparking lights begin to appear up above a distant sand dune you can see the lit lights lanterns and general glowing night life of a massive city over the high walls that surround its exterior this is a pretty amazing sight for those of you who have not been to such a large desert atmosphere and it is pitch black below you and at the height you're traveling-- how high are you traveling versus the ground i guess i should ask okay from this view you can see a large queue about eight heavy caravan carts long of caravans that have camped for the night outside of the front main gates you do see along the line of the outer wall there appear to be a number of small spires that open up like guard tower parapets that come to a pointed what looks like a hand cradling the outside of each section of the wall on the outside but on the inside you see a hundred or more of these long multi-level spires that progress all throughout the city and it goes on and on in its large oval-like shape it's hard to make out much color other than the thousand small lights you see throughout the entire city orange yellows greens blues it is a beautiful view what is your plan still night yes it's two in the morning at this point you can't tell from this height unfortunately you scoot down around the outside of the city walls the landscape here near the town appears to be more packed and hardened badland dust and sand you can see where lots of it from a recent rain have caked and hardened and then broken in places it leaves this soft shale-type texture to it that breaks into sand upon crumbling underfoot from what you can see there are a number of various heights of dunes in the distance this city is thrown right in the center of what appears to be hundreds of miles of desert from the view that you had as the sun was setting the gates to the city are closed from this perspective yes you guys timed this i didn't the giant iron gates stand about 65 feet tall and about as wide from end to end they have a very tight weave of iron bars between them to where it's almost a very thick fencing that you can almost see through you can just see the outline of things that walk back and forth behind it however on the front side you can see a number of guards stop looking at my piece of paper on the screen not actually not anymore it's not it's gone all right amongst the carved-out circle of caravan carts and people that are camping overnight before entering the city you do see what appear to be a dozen guards all dressed in dark blue and dark reddish metallic armor many carrying heavy scimitars to their side or long pikes and shields they're all wearing intricate helmets that crest down past the nose to the point where it looks like they just have eyes and a lower jaw it flares out at the bottom and then curves to a point right across where the clavicle would be the armor itself is designed in a very beautiful ornate fashion but also looks very functional you're at a distance they don't seem to have noticed you as you've all crested down still in your cloud forms the hand of ord isn't secret how far are you guys how far did you decide to stop and transform that's up to you they're maybe 40 feet from the gates make a perception check at a safe distance you can make out some detail and there is some lantern light on top of some of these carts it appears that a number of the folks have set up small tents and most appear to be sleeping there are a few guards that are set on top of the carts with crossbows resting over their lap keeping an eye in case anyone decides to get too close to their wares throughout the evening yeah it takes you a minute to transform the light radius beyond the wall itself is not very strong it only low-lights maybe a 30- to 40-foot area around the gate itself and there are a series of small torches that appear to be ever-burning on the outside of the wall there are a few campfires that have been set up by the caravans that are waiting amongst the sand and broken ground there they give a little more light as you guys get to the outskirts of this your shapes becoming visible to those that are keeping watch you see a few individuals stand up on their carts with their crossbows at the ready just have a seat and keep an eye bead on those of you that are visible doesn't appear to be any aggressive action just an acknowledgement of your presence and a show of readiness should any aggressive action be taken best you tell at this distance the few that you can see-- because a lot of them appear to be in small tents encamped-- the few that you do make out appear to be dressed in a little more wealthy attire than the people you encountered in shandal you can see the gentlemen and ladies that are guarding the encampment are dressed in functional leathers with hints of hide and metal plates incorporated in the defense but nothing that shows overt wealth or overt destitution general mercenary guardians for a traveling caravan at this hour no you get the sense looking at the surroundings of the campfires it looks like some sort of party or gathering may have transpired earlier in the evening but most everyone have passed out at this time scanlan the doorway glows with a faint purple hue in the distance you see some of the guards step forward and keep an eye out there attention has been gained by the doorway but none of them are approaching immediately you guys begin to step into the doorway one by one as three of the guards begin to slowly walk towards the doorway so with that percival scanlan and vex wait outside the shimmering doorway to scanlan's magnificent mansion you see the guards begin to approach the one at the front a square-jawed intense-looking man who looks to be not enjoying his current time schedule as a guard on the outside of the southern gates of ank'harel approaches hand at the side clutching some sort of weapon that he has currently sheathed may i ask the business of this strange conjuration you've brought at this hour of the night make a persuasion check percy i do not know of the nature of this magic that you bring but i recommend that you keep it outside of the city oh magic is allowed but this is unknown to us and unknown magic is a dangerous magic it does not matter we have 12 crossbows trained on this doorway and will for the remainder of the evening should anything strange happen we will not hesitate but to fire good turns around and walks back to the gate this is all the new schools of magic you guys go in mansion's prepared servants are at your ready beds are freshly fluffed damaged kitchens are rearranged to have been not touched at all you are able to rest for the evening as you prepare for your next day entering the city of ank'harel itself mulling over the events that recently transpired and digesting all the questions you still have okay as you guys have a restful night we're going to take a break we'll be back here in a few minutes and we'll pick this up in the following morning as they enter the city itself see you in a minute [break] okay (laughs) make a stealth check so as the morning comes about vex you go stretch out of your room scratching the side of your head messed up from sleeping wrong on the pillow and as you walk out you hear (clicking) and look to your right and see your brother slowly slinking away from keyleth's room yeah that happened take that luck feat (laughter) trinket comes waking up from what was his sleeping stance yeah you do all right as you all find breakfast a fair prepared chicken feast as they've been given no other instruction (laughter) yes scanlan the servants vanish for about ten minutes and return with a robust meal of bowls and bowls of chicken ravioli slightly you finish your meal feel yourself satiated as much as you can be with chicken ravioli for breakfast you guys exit find yourself on the exterior walls of ank'harel the sun blazing down in the early morning a hotter temperature than you've been used to in quite some time would be the equivalent of probably the low 100s fahrenheit by our standards all of you with layers of armor which is all of you except for grog immediately feel this is going to be uncomfortable fairly quickly grog you are used to higher colder climates even without being heavily armored still fairly uncomfortable it's not great you can see the caravans that you guys were camping loosely next to are no longer there it looks like there have been a couple of dark spots in the dust and the sand that have been kicked over where the campsites were where the fires were put out and tracks of where the carts and wheels have been dragged to and through the gate you can now see about ten guards that are all stationed at the front of that iron gate on this side of the ank'harel wall grog make an intelligence check you have no idea what they're talking about you find yourself instinctually nodding as you guys approach the outside of the gate you can see seven of the guards stay behind while three seemingly the same three that had been keeping a close eye upon your initial approach in the evening walk up the same man walks up now looking a little tired his day is probably finishing out the rest of his station here at the gate approaches hand still on the side of his sheathed weapon so you awaken you have rested what is your business here in ank'harel what is your contact within the city who do you wish to speak to you come for an audience with the emperor make a persuasion check you his arm relaxes at the side of his weapon and he looks down upon your diminutive gnomish structure though glances over at the much larger goliath and back at you if you indeed have business with j'mon sa ord then the emperor will let you in if you do not you will be sent out we have no business between either of those answers if you wish to enter do so but keep your weapons sheathed and keep an eye on that one yes i don't trust his face very well welcome to ank'harel be pleased he turns around and walks away his bow is much smaller than you were originally taught by jarett you get the sense that that's more of a formality and is on a smaller scale for more informal conversations as he walks back he lifts one hand and does a loop with it as he does (door thudding) the gates open ever so slightly enough to bring through as broad-shouldered an individual as grog as well as the rest of you easily you guys walk up and approach actually no one seems to bat an eye at the large bear that's wandering inside okay as you walk past him well best i can think there are many fine establishments of rest where rooms can be rented throughout the entirety of the city depending on how much coin you have to give i would say you could he thinks for a second as i look at my notes i would recommend within the suncut bazaar you would find the debt's respite the shade or the corner cove all very fine establishments and very well watched by the hand i am is this your first time in the city then (laughs) as he watches you guys enter the gates closing behind you you now see the incredible reveal of the interior of the mystical city itself streets of smooth cobblestone-like red pebbles lead your eyes to hundreds of visible vertically-inclined buildings of reaching peaks and smooth pointed rooftops as far as your eye can see across the cityscape it's a city of vibrant color you see nearly every home storefront and outhouse has some form of draping silks or painted mural to give it individual character standing out against the rest of its neighboring abodes creating a calming beautiful symphony of really nothing in the presentation of it all the people are walking with purpose and the sounds of foreign barking and shouts occasionally break the air welcome to ank'harel what do you guys wish to do as you glance over you see walking down the street what appears to be two teenage boys huddled together wearing drab ankle-length cloth robes one of them has a purple shawl over their shoulders the other has a hood up and they're both carrying small satchels of fruit in their arms they both stop and turn they look curiously at the small gnome the small pale gnome in foreign clothes and adorned beautiful armor that walks up to them in the street (muttered conversation) you are a very small man i'm sorry to hear that this fruit is actually very difficult to find and come across if you wish you could purchase this batch bazaar you are looking for the suncut bazaar it is farther down that way look to the blue tower in the center of the city walk in its direction to the eastern skyline-- okay make a perception check look for the strings of crimson flags that hang across the very street corners that will signify the entrance to the suncut bazaar 20 they both seem confused but also strangely enamored with this tiny man who's talking to them no shifty behavior beyond that (muttered conversation) i don't know what you're talking about i am sorry i'm confused he puts his hand out he takes it good luck finding your fruit and they both walk away but at a slow pace looking over their shoulder at you the whole way all right as you guys continue deeper into the city the sheer size of this town reminds you of a mirror universe form of emon in the way that the streets narrow and then open and the liveliness of culture around you in its heyday and it saddens you because it reminds you of back when the city was at its prime when you first arrived and made it a home for yourself but at the same time the energy is infectious and you can't help but feel like there's a lot of interesting people culture and momentum all about you no matter where you seem to walk across these streets though the culture here appears to be far older than that of emon that you've encountered even the buildings and constructs range in ways that-- maybe not as old as vasselheim per se but at least you can see that there's some variation to some of the abodes here that have been worn through time more so than any you have encountered in tal'dorei for the most part these decorated and intricate buildings fill the streets you can see pride in their construction and the smells of horses and hot desert air combine with various burning spice and sage that occasionally wafts through the air to your nostrils the ever-changing exotic skyline occasionally grabs your attention you see the distant shadow of what looks like a skyship docked at a sky port you get looks of many citizens expressions ranging from amusement to mistrust as you pass by until you come upon a massive building that shines with the sunlight above you you see a number of red flags that hang and drift about five feet in length these thin draping pieces of silk that shift with the breeze and you can see numbers of these strands across different roads and it's at this point that you look up and realize that this is the entrance to the suncut bazaar looking off towards the left and what you've been watching as you approach there are this cluster of dark blue and purple towers of various widths marking a central place in the center of the city in the center of them there is one very large cylindrical tower that rises up past them all into what looks like a chalice or a cup-like platform at the very top that is impossibly high amongst the rest of the structures here in the city it seems to be a beacon or watchtower over the entirety of ank'harel but your attention now here in the suncut bazaar as you step around the corner you can see tents and storefronts and buildings and voices raised as different barkers are shouting out for their wares you can see carts being drawn through the streets by horse and camel you can see what appear to be dozens upon dozens of people coming through with small satchels and coming by and purchasing their necessities for the day you can smell cooking meats and food in the distance you can see street performers juggling and distant music of buskers in the side of the street playing various flutes and instruments some you recognize some you do not you actually see a shawm it catches your attention on the side of the street and here you are amongst the suncut bazaar make a perception check 14 no matter where you walk eyes are on you most people you come around here it seems a largely human population beyond that you've not seen a single dwarf as you've walked through the city but you have seen a number of dark-skinned halflings a few half-elves not an elf has caught your eye since you've wandered through you've seen a couple of tieflings that walk openly in this city which is a rare thing from emon even there most tieflings generally are met with mistrust and prejudice in the street here no one seems to pay mind or bother you do see a few half-orcs this team of half-orcs that are shouting out in a language that none of you understand some sort of sales pitch they're giving and there's a few people gathered around them this is a very wide variety of people that live in this city and everyone seems to mesh together without issue or prejudice but not one goliath has caught your eye and you've caught the eyes of many and wherever you walk you can see the townspeople stop and they don't gawk they don't stare intently they're more curious but no one appears to be following you there are a few that appear to go into buildings but the majority of this as you look at now the suncut bazaar itself while it is a section of the city it is mostly open sky and is probably hundreds of various tents carts pop-up stand-ups and even the center of the street blankets set out with the various merchants there with their wares strewn across the ground waiting for anybody to come and approach go ahead and make an investigation check yeah it's pretty easy to see and most everyone's-- 11 you look around and ask a few people and most everyone shrugs their shoulders or points you in an odd direction and no immediate spice merchants catch your attention you're still on the outskirts of the suncut there are a few actually yeah and it's interesting in this very hot desert environment and you understanding how most plant life exists fruit should be pretty damn rare and what fruit would make it here seems to be pretty dry and withered but everything you come across here is very plump beautiful and fresh you go up to what appears to be a woman probably in her late thirties her hair is long past her shoulders and these dark black brunette waves that spray out like mermaid hair across her shoulders as you approach she eagerly reaches out you look like you are traveling here to ank'harel in search of beautiful delicious fruits of which to whet your palate yes would you like for these fine apples of which are the finest you could find ah well-- she takes the apples back what you'd prefer then would be the kurrak fruit and she pulls out what looks like a mango but the exterior of it is very rough with these little spines all around it while it is difficult to hold crack open for a delightful flavor it is gentle it is like a sweet water experience of course for this that would be two silver pieces the apples would go for one silver piece apiece thank you so much for your patronage anything else you would like the shade the shade would be-- it's hard to explain do you see that building over there with the dark green steeple and you glance off in the distance you can see layers back there appears to be one spire this very harsh point that has a dark green tint that is the roof of the shade that'd be what you're looking for not a problem okay you watch as she walks away she had her hands out to vex and as soon as vex keeps walking away she goes-- you are free to shop here any day you like she pulls the coin out and pops it away and says i am shubad shubad a pleasure to meet you okay both of you make investigation checks as you look around and ask around you stay close to grog grog glancing about you look to see something shine across the ground as you rush up and find it you find what looks to be a magically enchanted stone about that big rough around the edges but the reddish color is brighter red than the rest of the stones on the ground and you're sure that this may be exactly what you were looking for there are many red stones around it as you press the bit of dust and sand gathered around the other cobblestones but this one appears to be unique there's a hit of saltiness to the dust that has gathered in this vicinity you did (laughter) yeah percival what did you roll yeah it's funny for all the preparation of being a noble and public speaking you are utterly lost the culture is so vastly different from what you're used to and the people don't seem to really pay much mind to your relatively important outfit and presence and you're lost at sea vex walks up to you 19 the two of you begin to meander around look around you see after some wandering what looks to be a single blanket set out with a small half-dome shade structure of various cotton cloths that have been layered and pinned to create this loose escape from the sunlight and you see what appears to be an older man with a very long braided beard that goes past his belly-button he sits there sleeveless open shirt baggy pants no shoes and before him a deck of cards that is laying in a stack and he has his eyes closed with his hands resting at the ends of his knees depends on if you guys want to follow okay as you guys are approaching you over in the corner make a deception check deception yeah this marks your ability to double-talk or subtly put out the vibes for an individual who knows what scanlan's ultimate destiny is after a few moments of you doing this and a few people walking away looking frustrated and taken aback partially by your visual form and the unexpected contents of your words one man in his early twenties walking up what looks to be a damp cloth wrapped loosely around the head to keep the head cooled under the sun's heat walks up and leans in and goes you're asking about spice yes well i know folks who are purveyors of many spices here please what do you seek good good lead on we'll have a conversation as we go as he stands back up after leaning down for you you get a little glance at what appears to be a slightly pointed ear and what looks like a hint of a mustache that's grown through very similar in visual presentation as to your comrades not full elf not full human though definitely a much darker shade due to the out-in-the-open lifestyle of ank'harel you begin to walk with this figure through the street we'll get to you in just a moment so as you guys make your way to the older gentleman sitting on the ground eyes closed his eyes are still closed laura taliesin and be pleased his eyes open and you can see his eyes are snow-blind they are clouded over with what would probably be terrible cataracts or something else that has caused him full blindness but he stares past you as he opens his eyes so you wish to be read then laura marisha and five gold for my services he places it into a small side pouch what do you wish to be read for he takes the cards and begins shuffling his way of shuffling cards is interesting as opposed to the usual like double shuffle he picks up the deck in one hand and splits it and then shuffles it together turns it around splits it and then shuffles it together on each side it's this weird boy with a crystal in labyrinth but with a card deck it's wild as he stays still looking past all of you the shuffling stops and he grabs the deck you search for a garment and he takes two cards out and throws them across the center of the blanket for you guys you guys step back and take a look one of them appears to have a fire or a camp flame with smoke pouring up out of it and the other one appears to have a storm a torrent of water and he goes this garment you seek it looks to be in motion moving if you seek this garment here may haste take you your second question what were you saying in the second one what did you say pulls up two more cards and throws them and they land almost exactly in the same place as the other two cards that he tossed before they scoot to a stop one card appears to be mostly blank except it carries some sort of a stylized symbol or letter that you don't recognize and the other one appears to be a hand of cards stuffed within a pile of coin you seek this man yet it is not a man you seek to where the luck brings you the answers lie and he puts out his hand and the third question go for it pulls the two cards forward throws them down landing once again almost precisely on the same space as the last two tosses they slide to a stop one of them shows a chasm cracking in the earth and the other appears to show a singular sunken skull the path is to change historic but many will fall as the transition is to take take your time wisely for the hourglass runs quickly is this all of your questions he bows his head ever so slowly towards you then be pleased and he takes the cards and shuffles them back into the deck rights them into a perfect square with one quick move of his hand and places them back in front puts his hands back on his knees and closes his eyes and puts his head down there's a pause and he reaches over and grabs a small partially eaten apple and (chomp) his chewing stops and he swallows reaches out patting around it and finds the gold coins puts it into a pocket you ask for one more question what do you inquire (card shuffling) two cards land across the carpet before you one of them shows upon it two hands joining and the other one shows a symbol of a sun rising over a mountain range he says you've made many choices but the one you speak of brings unity and a new dawn he nods be pleased takes the cards up shuffles them back into the deck and sets it down he goes back into his meditative trance scanlan is gone as you're walking with your half-elvish friend down one of the nearby alleyways you hear keyleth speaking over the earring so you guys make your way towards the shade your half-elven compadre goes are you all right please which spice are you seeking he nods it may take a bit of time i know someone who could bring this but i could not bring you to them they'd have to bring it to you well where are you staying where would you need to meet that is far too busy it needs to be private away if you want a place to stay there is luck's run the casino there are back rooms there yes there is the debt's respite inn which has its own grasp of lowlifes those are probably the best bets the casino it is which room wear a red shirt he will find you in the casino all right hour past sundown we'll find you there an hour past sundown how much do you want he starts looking a little untrusting make a deception check he gives you a look and bends down he gets close to your face interrupts you and goes i mean this with all due respect being as small a man as you are you have to be careful he backs off hands up he goes very well the amount you ask i have no specific amount i'd have to inquire but i would say to be safe bring about 200 gold pieces with you just in case he looks at you confused he reaches out and takes your hand and you shake very well hour after sundown casino he brings his cloth up and brings it up over his face for a second and darts into one of the nearby corners and vanishes you eventually find it you guys find your way to the shade and it's a large circular sandstone wall that has a pointed tent roof above it held by a singular pole in the center it is segmented into various rooms that have no ceiling so everyone shares the same roof this is what appears to be a lounge tavern meaning there are drinks and wine served but each room seems to have a carpeted and pillowed floor looks like there are beaded curtains and various draperies that separate each of the different rooms and there's large hookah-type tobacco pipes it's very much just a relaxing lounge area scanlan takes about five minutes or so but eventually catches up to you guys yeah you look around you can see what looks to be a matronly older woman wearing some nicer dark purple and black clothing who is sitting there with one big hookah next to her side by herself with a glass of wine to one of the sides and is staring into space be pleased can i help you over the next few hours yes you don't say both of those have rooms yes do you have any other specifics or requirements corner cove is maybe two miles that way but the debt's respite is about a mile that way there are many merchants that live here warrior if you're looking for warrior merchants you're probably looking for the scarbearers well this definitely narrows down your search the debt's respite is where you'll want to go it's actually run by one of the heads of their ilk scarbearers they're a bit of a rough-and-tumble lot they hunt for coin sell what else they find odd jobs some of them maybe not the most up and legal but they work with a guarantee and the head of their troop i think runs or at least partially owns the debt's respite this i don't know raises her hand and one of the various workers there approaches with another bottle of wine yes may i help what is this you put in here blows it in her face that would be a dusk blossom sage walks away dusk blossom sage pungent would be the world you're looking for scanlan by the way is right behind you you see her eyes roll i mean no offense but this is my 'me' time she takes the coin flicks it back to you and goes i appreciate but do not require your patronage you guys are brought into one of the small sections of the shade you are given your choice of various tobaccos while it's not a large room per se you can all comfortably lounge in there it's a nice place to get away you can hear the distant sounds of the city but for the most part there's a soft violin music that plays towards the center of the area so at least it has a nice atmosphere to it make a perception check you see people with small large scars people with scars all over life out here can be a little tough at times but no more scarred than most of the people you've encountered in your lifetime and definitely nowhere near as scarred as the people you've run with for half of your lifetime it seems to be just delightfully flavored tobacco not really a bar it seems the servants take orders and bring you your various liquid imbibements yeah you see a man walks up to you long dark curly hair bit of a goatee growing how can i help you you want the sandkheg's hide the sandkheg's hide it's a drink it's expensive ah do you wish to have a glass or a bottle a bottle will run you 350 gold pieces walks off comes back with two very full-- (laughs) he comes back a little later with these two dark green glass wine bottles that have this heavy leather wrapped around them and bolted together at certain places it looks like leather at times but as you get closer you feel it's actually hard it's almost like a chitinous armor on the outside of the glass both of these vials are given to you with heavy corks that are wax-coated over the top here you are thank you very much and please do let me know if you require anything else and he exits the room you may you're currently private in the room it's an open ceiling but there are rooms segmented by cloth and what looks like sandstone walls so there are little pockets and alcoves and you guys currently have one that you're in right now comes off and the cork flies and bounces off one of the nearby walls the smell that comes to you is extremely strong it resembles a very vinegar turned wine mixed with this for lack of a better term a very earthy scent it's almost herbal medicinal it's not at all what you would have expected for something so expensive as it touches your tongue that smell transitions into a very acidic taste it actually burns your tongue and it goes numb within a matter of seconds it is not a delightful flavor and as the tongue goes numb the back of the throat goes numb as you swallow as the numbness continues down the rest of the body the flavor has not improved at all but it brings this universal numbness and as the slight pain of the burn subsides you with just but a few sips become extremely intoxicated but also just numb liam and you take a sip and the same sensation takes and the numbness sets in this slight vibration at the back of the skull elements of this remind you of being very drunk with but a few sips depends on how much you're drinking hour maybe 'it's very dangerous to harvest and create yes he thinks a minute then goes i don't know which part of the sandkheg it is but it is taken from the usually venomous bile or spittle of the creature mind you it is refined and pickled by the finest of various-- it is a delicacy across ank'harel and northern areas of marquet i was merely fulfilling the request of your companion i mean you are welcome to stay should you pay an evening price yes but that is not part of the price of the drink of which you have purchased no no you guys woke up maybe two and a half hours ago you're maybe getting close to noon the sun last you saw before you got here was close to the center of the sky okay who's leading the charge for that okay go ahead and make an investigation check if you don't mind 26 investigation check within ten minutes you've asked the right questions between a number of various street urchins and street salespersons to be directed straight towards the debt's respite in following the direction you end up walking up to what looks like a rather rundown-looking establishment the broken glass windows and missing front door lead you to think that perhaps it's been abandoned for months looks a little rough and ramshackle he said it was a place you could stay because you were asking for taverns and inns as you approach the front door it's partially ajar and as you push it open you can see the inside is a whole different story as your eyes adjust to the interior you find actually a bustling business of barhands slinging tankards across seven stained wood tables some of the folk look rather day-drunk similar to these individuals though it has worn a bit off since the original sip and most look to be various miscreants or post-work farmers taking a break the interior is familiar and probably closer to the taverns you're used to in more of the poorer districts of emon and surrounding cities than some of the more luxurious areas you've recently found yourselves in vax vex and keyleth-- actually keyleth make a perception check with disadvantage yes okay vex and vax as you guys walk into the room you do catch off in the distance behind a series of barrels that are stacked and the edge of a shelf that contains rows and rows of glasses tankards plates and various things you just barely make out what looks to be an androgynous figure face masked with dark blue and black cloth with a hint of leather armor hiding in the corner like barely visible to you and you can make out the details due to your very keen ability to gather your surroundings quickly nope this is very muddled low leather armor can't tell their back's hidden and they're quiet they have a hood and a mask looks to be like a cloth mask wrapped around him you guys also watch throughout all the various patrons and people that are wandering about this establishment one figure stands out amongst the others you see a bronze-scaled dragonborn bulky and thick muscular armored in light hides and bracers he clutches an untouched mug that is brimming with an amber-colored ale and is lost in thought staring off towards one of the broken windows that leads outside very heavy muscular arms maybe not quite the height of grog but definitely a similar build sitting down you can't tell what do you guys do there is no tavernkeep there are barmaids walking around and passing drinks but there is no barkeep right now you would speak to treev and points to the dragonborn who is currently staring out of the window he's spacing out as soon as you approach he goes (groans) what do you want bothering a fellow in mid-fantasy what can i do for you all right well what's your name vex'ahlia treev treev bonebreaker and grabs your arm as opposed to a handshake like a full-on forearm meaty grasp treev t-r-e-e-v treev bonebreaker current caretaker of this fine establishment looking for rooms i've got three available at this rate sure i doubt i'm going to find myself back to that dream anyway what do you and your rather scrawny-looking friend there have to say never been there well that's unfortunate sometimes cities fall to the lowest despots it happens rooms three rooms available how many are staying and your bear well we have to put a bear tax on this you realize yes i haven't had a bear here before who knows what damage it can do consider it protection all right i take no responsibility what happens to your bear outside that'll run you ten gold per room 30 gold for the night no god no i don't know where you're from in emon or what the prices are there but here it's expensive make an investigation check with disadvantage yeah he straight-up jacked the price up he can see the foreigner on your face certainly whatever your business may be is that all you need me no not originally why there is no tail behind him of draconia unfortunately no grabs his drink that he's holding up slams it on the table it spills over you fucking with me well there's a reason for celebration and just chugs the entire drink in one go you can see his dragonborn gullet just accepting the entire drink in one gulp (sighs) (laughs) sit down all of you 15 gold for the lot all the meaty details sure you tell him about everything and he listens in he starts enjoying it and eventually falls a bit sinking in the stake of things and eventually that celebration falls to acceptance well look if you're looking to hire you've got to explain the task then we do have a code fuck what the rumors say aye long enough what's the point in living without one that's how you end up shivved in the stomach and left to bleed in the street what you looking to hire for i know who you're seeking aye mistress asharru she's one of our

on your entire group since you arrived all sorts of entertainment there's various singers musicians dancers performers if you're looking for company there's all sorts of entertainment in that regard of all the spectrums if you're looking for games probably a few months out before we get to any sort of the gladiatorial events that's months away well you could certainly find a scrap but none that are sanctioned by the hand and they'll put you away lest you have someone to duel you that's a whole different business that's sanctioned by the law if you challenge one to a duel and they accept aye you just have to sanction it by the hand you have to make sure that you both agree to fight to the death and the fight has to happen in the bowl of judgment travis and sits about the sandherald district outside of the cerulean palace that's the cerulean palace it's quite close to it aye it depends on the sanctions of the ord and the agreement you come to but fisticuffs are great for the gladiatorial events but if you're fighting to the death sometimes it's nice to bring a blade in the kind that got nothing to lose the kind that got a point worth proving with their life those kind doesn't happen often when it does happen it's a spectacle a few months until the games begin but until then that's about the only way you'll find bloodshed here at least that won't lend you up in prison you're starting to gain it back what do you write he takes it he packages in in a small container a leather container oh don't worry (whistles) whistles through his fingers and the figure in the wall that you'd been watching steps forward and slowly walks towards the table holds up the scroll and the figure leans in covers his mouth and he whispers into the ear of the figure the figure takes the scroll gives a nod to all of you and walks out of the tavern he'll deliver that to her promptly now be on your way 15 gold takes a keyring out and starts fudging through the keys pulls a few off and tosses them to you across the table all right you've got it for a night okay you vanish out the door make a perception check 22 okay as you glance out the door and pull outside-- you're going stealth as well you said roll stealth 25 okay you turn around the corner just as you see a flash of dark cloth around the edge of the debt's respite you rush off to the edge and look around the corner way and down the alley you can see the figure full on arms out to the side rushed behind going into a very fast run down the shaded hallway the alleyway okay so you continue to follow all right following the masked figure you continue to give chance it darts erratically zig-zagging between areas you can see this is a very trained pattern to lose anybody following them but you're also trained in following those that wish not to be followed make another perception check you come around one corner and you can see there's a wall that ends there and you see just a little slip of material pass and as you glance over you can see the figure has jumped down onto a lower walkway onto what appears to be a recessed sector of this part of ank'harel and has already darted beneath a nearby bridge and overpass that walks across to another series of buildings you leap over keeping in the shadow and give chase down that way you turn around underneath the bridge and you can see underneath the bridge there is an archway that leads into a dark path down an actual hallway beneath the series of buildings you just saw ahead of you make another perception check 22 you look down the hallway and you see the shadow of the figure framed against what looks to be another opening on the opposite side but the sunlight is coming through you can just see the dark outline as it darts forward and then leaps off again down the right past that exit you follow and you look off the side just as you see the figure slink behind one large crate next to a storage section outside of a warehouse it ducks behind another one darts up to a building that looks to be shuttered and closed it looks like a furniture store with a little sign at the top that says a kingly home it moves an empty rain barrel to the side and slips the leather case through a hole that was previously hidden by the barrel dropping it inside the building slides the barrel over it again looks back and forth make another stealth check 25 doesn't seem to make notice and then darts off leaping leaping up onto a rooftop and vanishing off a kingly home keeping a very close watch on the path you took and marking it mentally back to the debt's respite it's probably a good mile off from where you guys were if not a little further you guys continue your conversation go about your own business eventually vax returns with the information the path of wherever this letter was dropped off to are you serious no i ain't drinking that bullshit yeah too stiff for anyone it's-- what that's not a drink that's probably squeezed from the arsehole of some sort of beast out in the desert i prefer my stuff taken from berries and the sweet stuff have you have some have you tasted it then i guess you know what an animal's bum tastes like eh oh completely they hold it down and just squeeze its abdomen and the whole sandkheg spews out into this little glass barrel and then you pay for it top dollar oh did you buy some make an insight check you brain is filled with image of whatever creature your imagination has come up with being held down and it is squeezing some sort of yellowish liquid from its abdomen into a glass wine bottle and you're now looking over at percy and keyleth who had just had sips of this earlier it's not sitting well with your stomach (cackles) vax now appears at the edge of the table (scoffs) no you find your own food it hasn't been filled since no do you guys head to your rooms okay you make your way up to the rooms they're all clean serviceable nothing too fancy but functional rooms each with two beds investigation check investigation check natural one nine nothing seems to be out of place or out of the ordinary 13 seems to be a room okay make an investigation check 29 you find dust dead insects a dried-out rodent husk and that's it it's also about 300 in the afternoon what are you guys doing you do not own a red shirt but you could probably find one not too difficult it doesn't take you too long costs you two silver pieces you find a nice red shirt billowing sleeves it's totally up your alley he's gone through the bazaar you're not too far from it maybe a ten-minute walk you walk around and there are weapons being sold no most weapons you find here are ornamental they're for decoration they're for putting above mantelpieces there are various blades that have bolting mechanisms in the back where you can easily mount them to a wall none of them that you can see at least that are open in this bazaar for sale are presented as an actual item for warfare make an investigation check 19 asking about you do come to within the bazaar a small wooden building that's like a hut but it's constructed of dark wood panels it resembles those strange marionette performance boxes except it just has this one frazzled-looking young woman standing there with long strands of curly dark brown hair red lips dark eyeshadow she's eagerly looking out with a sign in the front that reads oddities and eccentricities good day be pleased to you as well there are many oddities at my disposal i'm nisaba what kind of oddities are you looking for well let me show you over the next five minutes she brings out all sorts of strange knickknacks it's essentially a display from the most awkward of vintage salvation armies you've ever come across however you do catch a quick flash of what appears to be some small crystalline vials that appear to be strapped to some sort of leather bandolier this is for well a gentleman who passed through many years ago who claimed to be a great alchemist sold this off when he had come into a lot of debt within the city so i made a good price no one has really showed much interest in it you may the leather's finely made if a little worn the chemicals inside-- one of them does have a familiar color a deep herbal red this looks to be some sort of a low to medium level healing potion most likely from your experience in the use of that the two others are grayish and murky and don't really draw your attention or anything you're familiar with make an intelligence check 15 they do appear to have been prepared in the way that you prepare magically enchanted vials for potions themselves but you're not really able to make out just at a glance you'd have to spend quite a time to make out what their nature is well knowing that is now a magic potion of healing and two other magical potions that is a very valuable belt with its contents i would sell you just the belt for five silver pieces to include the vials and they do come as a set unfortunately that would run you 275 gold pieces we've had it for a number of years (chuckles) that is not going to work she reaches out and takes the belt away from you and sets it back down on the inside for the belt maybe right but you're willing to have and to offer that 75 gold for it please no it's not going to work i'm sorry make a persuasion check she goes 225 gold for the set make a charisma check just a straight charisma modifier to your roll she goes i appreciate your patronage but i am a patient woman and that is how i hold business (laughter) maybe a 45-minute to an hour walk you ask around it looks to probably be about four hours from sunset so you guys are making your way towards the cerulean palace as you approach the large extremely imposing palace you come upon what looks to be an endless series of stairs that brings you to the upper platform that is the central portion of the city where the palace seems to reside eventually peaking in the sandherald district that you were referred to earlier as the location of the palace and where the bowl of judgment exists you step up to the very top of the stairs to find yourself already breathless at the sight of the immense purple-blue-colored palace a dozen towers reach for the clouds the daylight peeking through their slightly translucent material like glassy waters ever-frozen in a fall the central tower the one that caught your eye that ends in a large cup-like position rises above all of them with a slight spiral-type texture to the outside of the palace that is incredibly tall amongst the rest of the cityscape as you get closer you can see the main palace structure presents hundreds of arches pointed at their apex in its structure smaller and smaller as it recesses further into the palace its very architectural build is a marvel and seems to both have consistency and a chaotic feel to the placement of some of these arches too in size it's a very strange but fascinating structure you can also see turquoise detailing and trim against many of the pillars and carvings and statues that adorn the exterior of the grounds of this palace as you approach what appear to be the front gates that ascend with a very bright blue turquoise exterior close to 50 hands of ord patrol various elements of the grounds around it it looks like there are actual pockets of grass and gardens that exist around the cerulean palace in here the topography changes almost to feel like it belongs entirely anywhere but the middle of the desert the guards do eye you suspiciously as you approach and you watch as one armored woman her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an ornate helmet of brass and blue approaches you guys welcome to the cerulean palace i must ask your business here our emperor does not take meetings my apologies but i must ask you to leave make a persuasion check 24 let me inquire with the grand maven she turns around her armor clinking and walks back to the palace leaving you guys there amongst these courtyard grounds a few moments pass before she returns the doors opening as she descends next to her you see an older woman with these long ceremonial robes that drag behind her spilling across the stairs as she descends seemingly dozens of gemmed bracelets that jingle as she walks with each step she wears a tall headdress with what looks like brass quills that press behind her head and down her back as she approaches you all the woman earlier that you spoke to the hand that approached you stays behind quietly and watches weapon at the ready the woman steps forward with a smile and unlike the abrasive appearance that most of the hand have given she seems to be more welcoming and gives for the first time since you've been here a very formal welcoming bow with her hand before her the other hand out says be pleased everyone i must apologize we were not aware of your arrival here i am the grand maven gameshega please enter and follow me as she walks past you and the female hand that saw you earlier steps aside and watches you as you pass then ends up stepping behind you and flanking keeping a watch from the back as you guys are led up the final staircase through the front turquoise gates of the cerulean palace and they close behind you with a resounding (impact) the impact echoing through these long halls from the interior massive pointed archways that lead down ornately decorated halls that echo with each footfall that hits across what looks like endless white and black bespeckled marble she leads you through a series of hallways more hands walking past as well as a number of other robed individuals what appears to be a central chamber that has a number of steps and seats where it looks like various philosophers are in mid-heated discussion in once again this same language that you have not heard on your ears before you are eventually brought to a very intricate and decorated waiting room with some finely upholstered silk chairs couches the grand maven stops if you would not mind please have a seat she walks into a nearby doorway it looks like a single door that leads into a small-looking room from the brief moment you have to see it the door closes and you hear a (magic sound) two minutes pass five minutes pass ten eerie quiet minutes pass no windows in this particular room but you notice as you take a close look the roofs while they are built of this deep blue almost glass-like thick crystal they're ever so slightly translucent and it gives this general blue glow about the entire room you can't make out any details from the outside but there is this strange translucence to the entire structure there is the hallway that you left behind but there standing in the doorway is the same hand that approached you guys and has been keeping an eye the entire time is away from you standing in the large archway hall that led you into this waiting room she glances at you you look like a strapping young man perhaps you can hold onto that for a time she leans behind the hallway (foreign language) just a moment another guard walks up behind and kicks a bucket into the room make a perception check you have your ear up against the wall well you're subtly doing it and there's nothing you get closer and closer and there's nothing the rest of you hear (magic sounds) but you're still-- eventually the door opens again and there the grand maven stands again she looks up to the rest of you come with me you have been granted an audience she steps back into the chamber you walk into what is a cylindrical chamber of smooth blue-purple quartz-like material with four strands of heavy chains taut between the ceiling and floor about 15 feet above you no other exit you all enter and the door closes behind you the maven still relaxing her arms to her side her headdress still giving her this ominous presence looks up and there's a (impact) shuddering sound suddenly the bland uncharacteristic walls compared to the rest of the palace begin to slide past the chains now making this rattling sound as the floor itself seems to be lurching you feel a bit of pressure in the room that wasn't there before you're all being lifted and the walls now no longer walled in by the rest of the palace you can now see this occasional traveling-down line as the spiral on the outside of the tower you once saw now surrounds you the walls are much thinner than the rest of the palace as you can see through this somewhat-translucent glass exterior the entirety of emon surrounding you from upon high as it goes lower and lower as you're lifted higher and higher into this tower it's very off-putting but beautiful at the same time everything's seen through this shimmering somewhat-refracted blue passage as you go higher and higher you can see the countless homes walls and towers getting smaller and smaller other towers eventually ending as you go higher in the tower the maven says i request you do not touch the walls please the view reveals the entirety of the city around you and beyond that the distant dunes and the desert that seems to have no end you view a far-off mountainscape a little bit in the northern direction that just begins to peek past your view then (boom) the floor ceases again you all seem to lurch for a moment yourself an inch before you catch yourself on your feet the maven catches herself very used to this transition you now see behind her where it has stopped there is another set of doors similar to the ones you entered from in the bottom portion of this tower the door opens (creak) and you can see the next room is a set of staircases of the same color that slowly curl off and disappear upward above you please follow me she walks in her robe dragging behind her you guys give enough berth for it to follow as you're led up the stairway choosing right or left they both lead to the upper platform in what is the top of the central tower of the cerulean palace as you enter this room you see close to a hundred dangling silk tapestries from 50 or 60 feet up of multitudes of different colors rainbowscapes of beautiful translucent cloths and silks gently flowing with breezes and mingling and mixing into each other around the outside of the wall high arched windows on each side and behind what looks to be a large opening reveals passing clouds surrounding this height and obfuscating certain portions as they meet with the height of this tower's apex you see a large balcony from the opposite side of the room that is opened from its own similar-sized arch that extends outward it has a railing about four feet up that is an opening that overlooks in open air all above the city to see in the center of the chamber you see a series of step-like platforms circular that rise up upon each other and in the center you see what seems to be a tall throne of bronze and sapphire that probably sits ten feet up from the base thin but extremely long and widens towards the top you can see hundreds of sapphires put into and set into this shiny ruddy metallic material that frames the entirety of the throne and there sitting atop this throne you see a slender human-like entity wearing no jewelry no ceremonial adornments no crown just a simple brown cotton shirt over simple elegant pants bare feet no shoes androgynous and beautiful you're unable to make out the sex of this creature it's not a man nor elf not fey but something somewhat alien almost the skin a deep-set reddish brown smooth and impeccable the features are extremely fine and delicate the eyes are what catch you black like night but the pupils burning points of molten metal the entity smiles and stands off the throne now at this height seeing it standing almost as tall as grog by comparison the limbs are elongated extends a hand towards you as you step into the chamber welcome to ank'harel heroes of tal'dorei i am j'mon sa ord and it is my pleasure to greet you and that is
