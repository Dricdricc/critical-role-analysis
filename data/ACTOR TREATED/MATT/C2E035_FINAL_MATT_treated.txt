it's to your right you see the left hand get cut off he screams out bleeding from the stump as he grabs it with his other hand the hand and the bracelet that was attached both clattering to the ground with a wet thud and it (spinning) falling over to the side beau you also look over and notice there is this horrible strange undead entity floating immediately to your right of you and algar this spectral creature that is ethereal but made of dark blue and black energy this drowned spirit that is giving off this horrible guttural sucking sound and fjord still stands there blade in hand looming over the two of you technically yeah you guys know where they went but you have no idea what's transpired since currently zsundie is floating towards the back of the chamber towards where they are what do you do okay you pick the bracelet and algar's like (groaning pained panting) make an intimidation check with advantage yeah it was part of my post what are you going to do please don't kill me please at this point zsundie appears at the back of the chamber rounding the corner the large thick barrel-chested fish-like form wearing this very well-tailored vest with the silks of the shirt billowing around its wet elemental form its fish face curled into this sly grin it spins around and looks towards algar and you guys it says with this low burbling fish voice ah i see the hour is nigh for vengeance it pulls the collar from its neck and it clangs onto the ground (uncertain noises) it puts out its hand you have seemingly come to the aid of this humble individual please hand me the implements of my enslavement that is not of your concern algar's still (moaning) don't trust him the rest of you are closing up on this space you guys leap up and begin to climb in the meantime the creature looks to you and says let's just say that there were powerful minds that were interested in the benefits of my undivided attention towards things that were of not my interest catches it picks up the necklace and both of them get tucked inside of its vest with this heavy wet sucking sound looks over to algar it would appear that you have this taken care of but would you do me the honors he's bleeding out yeah you guys all now have gone into the chamber you can see this he's definitely passed out he's not dead but there is a large amount of blood coming out of his severed stump make a medicine check that's enough to stabilize okay you've prevented him from bleeding out he looks pale and has lost a lot of blood and there is this dark pool that's still suffusing the space around him on the stone floor on the raised area of the hallway so he's stable zsundie as the rest of you came around the corner you can see him standing there looking at the group well i have things to take care of now it looks to you ketiv zsundie is my title i've been held here for too long should you find yourself among the endless seas of my world come to my silversilt palace there i shall reward you for your assistance now i'll go to free my partner that's a good question and it leaves okay that is a 14 what's your dc what's your spell dc the specter goes (groaning) and immediately turns around and starts drifting down the hallway away from you giving this horrible hollow sucking scream yasha's with you she was making her way towards the sea but hasn't made passage anywhere okay i like that a gortle there you go tortle skirts jester needs to get out more okay as the wave of healing divine energy emanates from clay's focused point algar who's still being held against the wall by beau (gasping) okay all right that is 14 okay so he succeeds you can try it again if you have another ki point oh wait no let me see i think he might be immune to it for the next 24 hours based on the ability if he succeeds on it yeah i think so well i'm going to double check here but i think if he succeeds in the save he's immune to it for 24 hours i could be wrong let me double check here yeah you can wait 24 hours and then come back to it make an investigation check please 12 okay rifling through his bits you find 21 gold pieces 45 silver pieces two platinum pieces you find one empty glass vial where a healing potion was used previously a dagger and a basic hand crossbow with five bolts perfect he does attached to the shirt if you want to pluck them there are six buttons no you're fine to extort truth no you can continue to try it if you want to all right with every more button pulled (smack) button (smack) button you're teaming up on this regard okay that's a failure that's a natural ten okay you slam his head two more times and pinch an area underneath the bottom of the jaw it causes his irises to swell for a little bit he looks towards you head lolling a little bit he doesn't answer but you have his attention it's my job i was assigned as the supervisor of the sluice gate i report to the clovis concord i was assigned here maybe a few months back from port zoon but i largely specifically report to the marquis and his associates marquis ze fuldan no he's resisting answering make an intimidation check with advantage because you have him affected with the extort-- in his current position he (grunting) the margrave and the concord are aware this is one of two cities that runs with one of these marid underneath (grunts) yes port damali with the muscles popping i drink and carouse buy fine linens and furniture yeah you asked what he does with his spare time none really i take companions the ruby is a very beautiful creature a few more weeks of wooing her yes there's a conflict inside where his masculine pride immediately hits with the hit to his ego that you just delivered my job to maintain the weave to help exert my will on the creature that you just freed so it can direct water towards the various furnaces that run a lot of the engines that help maintain some of the commerce here in the city oh i fucked it up well thanks to your interference here they're probably going to have to re-network everything through analog means that'll take weeks it'll be expensive you hear his head hit the stone once more who the fuck are you make an intimidation check with advantage he looks down at his severed hand the stump having now healed over from the healing power of your prayer look please i don't want to die i don't want to die down here i don't want to wash up in the middle of the shore that sounds like a great idea he nods right yeah i'll go i'll leave immediately just please let me go same way i come in every day yeah i'll show you out it's not on her it's up in the boat you guys had put in the water she goes mostly just blankets and gold right jorge he's still trying to pull away from the horrible slow sucking of-- oh the tentacles wrapping around the neck and there's a slight biting right there he sits there held to the wall being chewed on by a tiny octopus for the next 30 minutes while you roll-- okay roll for your disguise kit not with advantage but you get proficiency bonus so roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier algar looks like a weirder uncle of algar who could probably pass for a jorge sure yeah but he looks different and is missing a hand so it's definitely not algar no no traps there are some lockdown failsafes but it's not much help at the moment he gives you a look that doesn't nod but you can see from his recognition that you hit the nail on the head he looks to beau to be let up because he's still being pressed he gets up (grunts) still looking over the missing hand and back at the rest of you and begins to slump his way further down the hallway where they were heading to exit you're following him down this path he's using a small torch that he lit for light to make his way down here and as he leads you through it opens up into a few other small chambers that have some tables and chairs there's a number of weapons close-quarter smaller weapons for any combat that may take place in a tunnel there's a small sketch with charcoal or some sort of a darker chalk on the wall that outlines the layout of the sluice weave for those that are coming in to see where they're trying to go and get to yeah yeah you do it's part of it now there you go eventually he leads you to a spiral staircase that goes upwards there are two sets of iron barred doors he has the keys to he opens them leads you in you do notice on the way through there are a couple of archways leading from chamber to chamber where there are gated portcullis doorways that would collapse down there are switches on the opposite side as a means of defense if things were to go wrong to back up once you have them under your control he has no means of doing so and you watch him very carefully heading up the spiral staircase it leads you to a trap door that a stair leads up to he pushes it open quietly and it leads you into a small office it's got a small desk it's got a stool it's got some odd stacks of paper looks like there's a quill and an inkwell a second unopened inkwell there's some partially melted candles that aren't lit at the moment and there is a door that exits he unlocks that door i understand this is my office yeah the few that i work with yes make an investigation check you glance through quickly a lot of it appears to be notes on repairs on how best to organize the time that the marid has there is an actual breakdown on how often it can summon elementals and control them you find some things that talk about a marid defense of the city meaning there is a plan in place that if ever the city were under attack from the sea that it was one of their secret weapons to defend the city from ships that's the most you can find those are all surface things that you see on the desk the rest of it doesn't seem to make much sense or pertain to anything important to you a few of them he points to a couple i was left-handed make an investigation check looks like an office that's fine his stare is far off in the distance he is looking down the barrel of a gun and a complete shift in his life that he wasn't expecting to take immediately his responses are very one-word and very no you escort him to the wharf as a sailor you know specifically who to talk to to secure passage under the table where do you want to send him (laughs) it's a good summer stay-away yeah that's one of the major coastal cities on the eastern side of tal'dorei all right because it's a longer journey it's a little more expensive but you can secure passage for him to marquet for we'll say 20 gold this is very kind of you the beard's peeling a little bit he's just staring at the coin in his palm adella leaves in little under a week you can secure passage today on a small ship that's heading back to marquet you send him off on his way you wait another hour or so to make sure the ship disembarks and he doesn't abscond from the ship itself you watch as it begins to make its way towards the horizon and you feel confident that he's not going to be coming back anytime soon eight here's a question did you dismiss your specter or do you have a-- as you guys are-- as you're leaving the area right behind you is this (ghostly groaning) what do you do with it yeah it's following you you guys begin to watch as that same drowned specter is now coming back behind you (groaning) it turns right around and runs off a bit it's frightened of him and runs away correct it doesn't last a long while a short time passes and it just-- you already have well you checked around for anything that would be interesting so-- (groaning noises) how many channel divinities can you do i feel like you were out last time we'll say you took a short rest but-- it's wandered back in the chamber and it's looking at fjord (groaning) turns around and starts walking away (ghostly groaning) the specter returns as you guys are having this conversation all right go ahead and make an attack roll okay that's 12 so it takes damage that's basically what this is 11 points of radiant damage all right (impact groaning) success it's not attacking anyone it's not assaulting you guys it's just standing there and taking the hits and looking in pain it keeps looking for fjord (ghostly groaning) it disperses into shadow and vanishes this was me realizing that this is what would have happened earlier so we're taking care of it now okay because this would have been following-- i forgot about the specter briefly earlier and this would have happened i appreciate that they've completely glossed over this scenario we'll say that you guys are all together go ahead and roll for your forgery kit with proficiency so d20 plus-- i'll say this is for intelligence-- okay so you have a fragment of possibility i'm saying because it's a forgery and it's having to pay attention to details i'm going to say intellect intelligence yeah you don't have to roll twice you don't have to spend it if you don't want it plus three i think 22 pretty good forgery you're proud of yourself it looks pretty spot-on based on his handwriting you've followed his cadence his sentence structure his signature looks incredible yeah i'll say with your strength you can easily do so it will break the quill technically but it still pierces it to the door there you go cool so the letter is complete and placed yes we're-- okay this is my fault for forgetting one feature earlier and trying to fit it into the narrative here order of business you arrived you forged a letter-- you saw a weird undead thing again that was following you and then fjord made it go away with a hand wave you then took jorge to the docks and sent him on his way you guys are near the docks you've made your way out okay it's still there floating you can see there's one fisherman who's eyeing it curiously okay you go ahead and make your way out get up on the side of it and begin to row yourself back to the edge of the dock there not far away is the old fisherman you had spoken to earlier that you had borrowed it from you gather your things out of it and he comes over and is like well i appreciate you bringing this back no such thing no such thing' you too tall one make a perception check it looks like the city i mean at this point in the day it's getting a little later the sky is starting to get a bit-- maybe the oranges of dusk are starting to peek in a little bit you maybe have another hour or so of daylight make a perception check currently no you don't see him anywhere yeah you don't know yeah i mean occasionally he's out there looking for work that's as much as orly knew marius no sabian you heard about through fjord you got some information about sabian yes yeah that was through captain adella it's close to dusk about an hour of daylight left okay it's a little bit of a roundabout walk but you can do it all right so you make your way back to the open quay heading towards the tower you can see as you approach based on whatever illusory enchantment finds your vision you can see as it seems to grow the closer you get to it to the point where it's massively towering when you're right below it still no sign of a door at first glance you still have the 20-foot-up or so balcony and a few other windows up that way you can see the top two windows have now that it's gotten darker you can there's a little bit of a firelight glow at the very top of it make an arcana check make a perception check ten you assume it's either some sort of spatial enchantment to it or it's an illusion maybe that's as much as you can make out from it natural 20 the city doesn't appear to be heavily changed by any means-- you do notice that where previously there were some plumes of white smoke or steam that rose from certain more industrial aspects of the city are much thinner appearing to be more residual columns of steam and smoke you're at the tower the tide peak tower anything you want to do yep yussa errennis make an intelligence check to see if you can overlay the memory of the sketch you saw with the location in the quay yep 16 you feel like you've been able to take the two and map them together pretty well nothing passes directly beneath the tower no the sluice isn't a wide network it's a handful of deliberately placed tunnels to make their way towards specific parts of different districts all right by the time you make it to the lavish chateau it is sunset the last bit of light that vanishes over the horizon far over the ocean the lucidian ocean in the distance you make your way to the interior where a number of folks have finally gathered maybe a handful six or seven people are already in there enjoying meals having drinks you know that there isn't a performance tonight but people are in there enjoying the relatively comparably classy atmosphere as the familiar band plays their music what do you want to do good call okay all right you guys make your way up to the third flight you missed him last time but you come upon the familiar sight to you which was your mother's personal bodyguard for half of the time at the chateau bluude which was also responsible at times to watch you and escort you when you went to the city the rest of you are caught off-guard by the sight of this massive dual-horned minotaur wearing a very very fine shirt but is donald ducking it the rest of the way thankfully relatively thick thick fur down there you'd have to pry to get a good look but is standing there arms crossed and goes oh jester he comes over and picks you up actually no he wouldn't recognize you because you're a tortle probably not not unless you say anything now we go into the oh jester there we go that's the moment right right with a d of course i assume that is the case he knocks on the door at that point the door opens up a bit and peeking through is the ruby of the sea marion whose hair is perfectly curled even without an evening performance she smiles at the sight of all of you at the door and looks curiously at the large skirt-faring tortle hello not at the moment no oh jester hi yeah please do come inside everyone come on you all make your way into the chamber okay she shoos out her servants and the door closes she has not she's like oh my goodness it is so nice to meet you yasha she shakes her hand and yasha awkwardly hi and looks to the rest of you and leans towards the back wall and crosses her arms not one for social graces necessarily but seemingly looking at marion looking at jester looking at marion and can see the relation marion sits down in front of her mirror and her little table set up in the corner spins back towards the rest of you welcome back there is no performance tonight i apologize but if you would like us to provide food for you or whatever you like please do not bother to let me know there are a number of guys that i know yes algar yes he left huh well that may very well be a great turn of luck in my benefit definitely thank you for looking into that  well that makes me feel more comfortable thank you very much i appreciate it very well i will ensure that you are all properly taken care of this night (clapping twice) she goes ahead and brings the servants back in a meal is placed for the rest of you and as the evening progresses and you take a bit of time to rest-- yeah go ahead and take a short rest you guys manage to enjoy probably one of the better meals you've had in a while you guys are eating downstairs they're not bringing room service up into her chambers not at the moment no you hear the heavy footfalls of bluude making his way down the stairs and goes and finds a corner just to keep an eye then marion now dressed in her casual evening gown which in itself is still regal and beautiful and trails behind her up the stairs as she descends comes to join you at the table and sits she smiles at the rest of you and gives a renewed nod to yasha whom she just met well i am very happy to see that you've made a good group of friends a travel family just warms my heart is everything all right not in the slightest jester this is no imposition i'm just happy to have you home for a bit how long do you intend to stay i have a friend who had a similar problem years ago if you would like there is a physician we could have take a look at you and see if we can a way to no longer have that problem ah young jester was rambunctious curious ever running off getting into well trouble and finding trouble making trouble for me it was a joy she was very quick to learn ever smiling brightening any chamber she walked into she had a good sense for who needed to be taken down a peg very much so more so around adolescence i think but she has always been sweet inspirational-- very proud of her yes but not anything i can speak of in mixed company you guys are in the downstairs in the main tavern area of the chateau i agree it's a big old cast iron tiki mask with giant tusks oof all right curious choice but i understand probably for the best there is not much of a mouth hole so eating is going to be very difficult takes a little spoon and is like all right here we go try to make it-- there it is perfect you guys talk for a bit she shares some embarrassing stories of jester's childhood asks each of you a little bit about your story and we'll say for the better part of the evening it's an enjoyable respite from the chaos of the day and the chaos of the journey your blink dog has dried as has your weasel you can and as you go ahead and find-- there is a coat room essentially where the young man who had originally met you when you got there is inside you can see him sitting in the back on a stool going like this he's staring in the far way and there's a coat rack where professor thaddeus is sitting on there staring at him as you enter the chamber-- oh hey you can see there's some scratches on his cheek yeah he's fine just watching him right there i think not hard to feed these roll an animal handling check he dives towards you and goes right over your shoulder and is now in the middle of the central tavern (fluttering) the leather cord of his leash is now dangling as he's up in the rafters (hooting) everyone in the chamber's like-- there're people that are eating who are like what the-- they're all staring up at this owl that has now found a brief perch up into the roof chamber squeaks like a balloon you're holding the beetle make an animal handling check eventually it dives down snatches and-- a little prick on the finger from one of the talons-- but eventually makes a quick meal and heads back up yes of course to be honest i've been thinking about maybe having a pet so this will be good training well since you've been gone you know they're interesting definitely i imagine that it is-- how is it special this sounds like a warning (poof) it appears on your chest and catch it for a second she's like oh my that is as tricky as perhaps the daughter that i have (panting) you're home oh i am your home immediately she goes heh and pets him over the table yeah it's getting close about 11 1120 all right make one more animal handling check eventually seeing this command-- (flapping) comes to rest onto your wrist okay you guys make your way through the streets heading towards where yeah well there's the restless wharf and there's the open quay the place that you had heard this information-- you didn't get any specifics he just said near the docks but you were in the restless wharf when you got this information all right who's helming a lookout yeah there are torch poles set up towards the wharf that are giving a faint bit of light but other than that it's not a full moon but it's mostly full and there's quite a bit of moonlight coming down over the dock you can see it glittering across the water in the center of the harbor there are a number of ships quietly set out in that vicinity the star-clustered sky completely envelopes the air above you it's a beautiful view the closer you get to the docks you can hear the sound of waves crashing from out of view the creaking of wet wood filling the air as the docks shift and the number of boats that are currently moored to the center of the harbor creak from side to side as the water comes in every now and then you see the slow glowing beam of the lighthouse pass overhead about once a minute or so it's a very slow moving pulsing rhythm now ships of varying sizes sit across the dock spread tied to their various posts all seemingly lightless and lifeless in their slumber there's no one doing any sort of evening work on these ships at this hour you see a handful of zolezzo patrolling up and down the sides of the dock doing their rounds no urgency or direction necessarily make a perception check if you don't mind clay 26 jesus okay then you-- you watch out for one of the westernmost docks of the district to see a shady figure darting between patrols watching as the zolezzo will pass and then use that moment to dart across the street and wait for the next zolezzo to pass and then make their way over to the edge of the wharf you see them now ducking near a stack of empty shipping crates and they wait every now and then glancing over when a zolezzo's not nearby or looking towards one of the darkened ships that is anchored towards one of the dock extensions not that far from one of the docking cranes that's left still after an evening of offloading from one of the other ships you do watch as a zolezzo holding one of their portable torches and a sheathed sword glances over in the direction of where that shaded figure is steps towards it and holds the torch up and begins a soft call out hello the shaded figure stands up and approaches hands open smiling getting a better look you do see finer elven features a lighter ashy hair that's short on the sides and flopped in the front who approaches talks briefly you can't really hear what they're saying it's hushed but puts something into the hands of the zolezzo the zolezzo takes a moment nods and then turns around and leaves his post the figure goes and then darts back behind the crates once more and keeps looking over towards that one single ship that's about 35 or 40 feet from where he's sitting make a stealth check with advantage okay you make your way over to the side of the docks on the opposite end and there's a little step up from this edge of the street and you have a few buildings begin to give way the road ends and there are bits of it that break off and fall off the short cliffs into the water there's the docking crane to your left on a bigger piece of the dock that's out of the way but it's blocking a lot of the view on this side the ship that this figure is focused on and the crates that he's by on one side you get to the other and keeping quiet you don't think you've been noticed make a perception check you're waiting not much else seems to be going on okay you just sit there and wait okay the rest of you doing anything okay mmkay you begin casting that caduceus as this is happening there are a few of those torch poles set up and there's one at each dock nexus the one by that ship the light flickers out you don't see that and you're not close enough to hear any of this you see as a handful of figures seemed to have come out of that ship walked across the gangplank and put that torchlight out make a perception check for you if you want to glance or are you asking caduceus she can't make out details and even from this distance you can't make out a bunch because they're all wearing either full cloaks or half cloaks that end right about just past the elbow hoods up not uniform patchwork in color and make but they're all obscuring their features intentionally nott you watch as the figure that's waiting stands up out of the spot looks around looks that there's no zolezzo currently patrolling at the moment and begins now to step onto the dock and walk towards the figures on the ship okay goes and approaches the figures there's now two that have stepped up to meet and you can see now there are a few more that are still in the ship that are watching from-- it's a fair size i'd say from tip to end it's about 50 or so feet single sail but a big sail it's currently furled up it looks like it's a ship that's designed for speed more than cargo but it's a decent-sized ship the dock as you're walking continues forward and then it turns a little bit at an angle and there are other ships that are docked there's a smaller fishing ship on one side there's a rowboat that's set off in the water there it's facing towards you at an angle and is currently anchored at the edge of where the dock turns to the right there is a gangplank set out between that and the dock where the figures are stepping up they're meeting right where that gangplank is and where that torch was snuffed all right go ahead and make a-- how do i want to do this there you go i walked into that one make an acrobatics check for me fjord (splashing) the figures all of a sudden all stop and turn as well as the one who was talking and they all look in your direction thaumaturgy-- it's not so much an audio mimicry spell but you can make certain sounds happen so i'll say roll a performance check (unconvincing dolphin chittering) (laughter) make a deception check make a deception check with disadvantage as you give this display the figure with the sword out that was looking for the edge of the water where fjord was looks over at you and goes-- with the little bit of features you can see a chin a scruffy beard poking out beneath the hood still with the blade there turns back gives a hand motion towards the ship oh it's about ten foot you can climb up on the cliff if you need to no when you started this everyone was going into the-- you're maybe three minutes the figure gets within 15 feet of where you're standing and says hey piss off closes his fist three arrows get loosed from the ship in your direction that's a 14 to hit misses i believe that's a 19 to hit and another 19 that is seven points of damage go for it it's 1d10 plus your monk level isn't it yeah you roll a d10 plus your monk level six ooh okay roll a d6 plus-- right the arrow is a d6 plus your dexterity modifier i believe it's-- let me check the rules real fast yeah it's a d6 plus your dex seven points of damage you send one back you hear (pained grunt) but at a pretty decent distance the other one that hit you that's eight points of damage that's a second ki point you spent right but you've already used one reaction so you have to spend another ki point to get an additional reaction eight points one point of piercing damage okay go for it yeah is this to the guy that already took an arrow or to another because there were three of them that fired at you the same guy gets hit by both arrows at this point the guy who had given the order sees you do this and his hand comes down gives a quick shout over his shoulder come on take them out they've seen too much that's what i'm about to show you that is the figure no i think we're all right so you guys were-- actually you should be a little further back fjord you are in the water right there caduceus jester nott you would have been hiding off to the other side of the dock here caduceus jester you're keeping out of sight best you can to watch this yasha-- whoever wants to run yasha-- is going to be with you guys as well we will because we're going to take a break before we jump into this because it's nine o'clock that'll give you guys a moment to figure your shit out we'll be right back here for this giveaway while we're gone by wyrmwood we have here the-- oh it's

right starting at the top 25 to 20 nice 25 to 20 he's the only one okay 20 to 15 all right okay 15 to ten what did yasha roll again i'd say it's a plus let's say a plus seven to hit you know the rules for rage we'll go with that she does an additional you should probably pull up the stuff that was something that should've done during the break well you did not now you don't have yasha's abilities that's how it works out yasha will be doing some damage if she gets there all right so top of the round fjord in the middle of this chaos now breaking the arrows being flung you are in the water and ten feet below the dock what're you going to do all right yeah that's what it is no it's summer's dance i love it what is the-- well i was going to say the misty step is it on a short rest or a long rest that it gets back gotcha perfect all right make a persuasion check with disadvantage yeah because you literally showed up ruined this whole deal he was about to make he's not willing the spell still happens he just doesn't come with he tried how long is the-- 90 feet most likely yeah you have to count it out yeah easily you can make it anywhere on that dock pretty much well it doesn't kill marius that's good all right so there's this blast this loud thunderous sound which may have gotten the attention of a nearby zolezzo or two there's none in view currently so you don't know it could be a while until one of them shows up you get the sense that that was a loud noise because it's a thunder step that ends your turn yeah that ends your turn that brings us now to the bowmen the bowmen who-- no actually you showed up and made a (poof) but they don't know where you showed up you just vanished out of sight they're all going to focus on on the one they were already told to fire at so they're all going to aim at beau that's going to be-- actually they had a hard time with you and you threw it back so only one of them's going to fire on you the other two are going to fire at caleb against beau that is-- 20 to hit at this point it's midnight you guys went there mid-afternoon so it's been yeah it's been past eight hours that is four points of damage to you beauregard all righty then two attacks against you caleb both are 15 they both splinter off of you no issue you are after beau and nott then other characters go and then your turn they're going to go ahead and-- this guy's going to move up to the side here to get a better view of you this guy's going to shift off to the side this guy's going to move up to the top to get a better view as well the one that's moving by is going to be like quick quick and he's like shouting down into the door that leads deeper into the ship underneath the ladder right there that brings us to beau and nott's turn this guy is marius beau it's your turn what are you doing right here all right so you rush up to him go for it roll for an attack 12 misses you punch short you swing and it hits but it hits his heavy splint armor and hurts your knuckles a bit and he takes it now that you're up in his face you can see he's a big imposing half-orc and currently looks to not feel very threatened by you that was your first attack 17 just hits travis 17 just hits six points of damage all right all right that's a 17 15 plus two on a constitution save so stunning strike no effect unfortunately you still have your bonus action okay you got it nott as far as you know he doesn't see you mm-hmm that definitely hits go ahead and roll sneak attack damage 21 points of damage you watch as he goes from this arrogant watching you flounder in front of him as he takes the blows and keeps grinning suddenly double over as the bolt is now deeply buried into his abdomen yeah that was a pretty tough hit he's hurt (laughs) roll a stealth check yeah you do (laughs) now you know all right that ends your guys' go it is now the enforcers' turn one enforcer comes out of the center of the ship and looks and sees this going the guy up top goes quick burn it all this guy is going to go ahead and jump back down into the ship that enforcer's going to pull out a hand crossbow and is going to go ahead and take a shot at you since you're off in that way has disadvantage on the attack but you're--right now-- because you're out of his range he's going to go ahead and grab and pull marius towards the gang plank he's going to go ahead and fire at you that's 15 to hit misses yeah you (bash) with your shield ricochets off no issue that's going to be the end of the enforcers' turn jester you're up you look like you're-- it's close okay (counting) yeah he's within 60 feet all right he-- the guy with marius-- rolls a natural 17 the guy next to beau rolls a natural three (singing) paralyzed you are currently concentrating there the big guy with the bolt in his stomach goes (groans) and his whole body locks up and you can see his eyes go wild as he glances down at you unable to move at all does that finish your turn you can keep moving the rest of your movement if you want to around here you mean okay (counting) 25 30 that's as far as you can get with your movement all right that ends your go that brings us to caleb yep from lobbing this stack of fruits and heavy wooden boxes into his head all right as the crates slam into him the body rocks back for a minute but is still holding itself in place right now there's splinters of wood sticking out of his armor his jaw is all messed up the hood gets blown back and you can see the grayish hair that's tangled and sea air-matted that is now streaked with blood from the impact bits of his face are covered in gore he's looking pretty hurt he's also taken a rough round this has not gone well all right so caleb that ends your turn it's now the captain's turn who is paralyzed his really really cool round that he was going to do that was going to be really awesome doesn't happen because he's fighting against the spell he's going to make his save he's going to make a wisdom save to see if he can resist the-- that's a 12 he did not save he's still held all right that brings us to caduceus okay towards all right go ahead and make the ranged attack roll you're casting it at first level all right guiding bolt i think is 120 feet i think it's pretty far yeah that'll hit he's only wearing leather armor nice the bolt hits him and and you see now this vibrant glow as the impact-- the energy forms around his chest creating this beacon the next attack against that enforcer right on the gangplank has advantage he's pretty visibly hurt he's not on his last legs or anything but he's taken some wear and tear as a bonus action go for it full movement there okay there you go you are not visible at the moment that finishes caduceus' turn yasha's up understood easy enough to do she does she gets two i mean you can go for it she has advantage on him because he's paralyzed no reckless any attacks against you yeah it's been a while since you've been reckless it's fine that hits and that is an auto-crit because he's paralyzed 12 does not hit unfortunately for her as a-- yeah that's going to be bad for him this is for the zealot there we go the first hit equals 1d6 plus half your-- okay so it's 2d6 plus six damage the dice are doubled plus an additional d6 that's doubled 26 i think that's 28 plus six for her barbarian level yeah she just eviscerates him man as he's there frozen in place yasha's rushed up and cleaves right through his chest and you watch as he folds into two pieces both tumbling off into the water there's now two halves of the orc floating in the water below all right fjord you're up yeah that'll get-- you can't get everybody in the ship you'd be missing either the guy at the front or the guy at the back which one do you want to-- okay so the front then that's a wisdom saving throw that is a 15 13 plus two the guy at the front resists next guy behind him natural 16 plus two he resists the guy next to marius fails and marius fails you watch as both marius and the enforcer standing on the gangplank their faces immediately go dull as they stare up at this-- what you see as nothing you have no visual perspective on what's happening but suddenly they both go slack-jawed and stand staring up in the air at this empty space yeah kind of all right so that's your action anything with your movement all right you make your way to the edge of the dock right there perfect all right that ends your turn it's now the bowmen's turn seeing you now casting the spell making a ruckus on the dock nearby all three of them turn to face you this guy's going to go ahead and shift over and get a bit closer to the edge and all three of them are going to fire at you fjord natural 20 on the first hit of none of them double-check that just in case the next hit against you is 17 plus four oh suffers you can remove that okay and that's a natural 17 plus four all three hit you the crit is not a crit thanks to caduceus that's going to be six points of piercing damage seven points of piercing damage and seven points of piercing damage (arrows impacting) they're going to go ahead and then use their movement to back up a bit back into the ship this guy's going to duck below over here they all duck low and they're all going to attempt to hide okay you watch as they all disappear into the shadows of the ship's deck you're uncertain where the bowmen are that brings us to beau and nott go for it 24 to hit yeah that hits yeah it's advantage to hit so you can roll twice sorry there you go because he's not aware that you were there and you were hidden yes nice he immediately breaks out of the stupor glances over and looks at you and he's hurt pretty bad he's glancing over in your direction looking at the rest of everyone there seeing how things are shifting looking to his ship he looks like he's planning something what else are you going to do go for it 17 to hit that still hits (death groans) (cheering) marius no marius is still just standing there in the middle of the gangplank looking upward going-- all right beau they don't know that they don't know this ability all right (counting) 45 speed oh i thought it was 40 it's a rough night out here in nicodranas (laughter) there you go you're up on the gangplank with him now you can use your action to grapple if you want to okay make an athletics check no it doesn't matter you have him i just wanted to see you roll he's not fighting at all he's literally just standing there going-- you grab him do you have a ki point you can you have to pull him back at half speed but yeah i'll say that knocks him out of his stupor when you're choking him and forcing to pull him backwards-- yeah but grapple by putting your staff into his throat and pulling him backwards-- you've pulled marius back all right that finishes beau's turn that finishes nott's turn now it's the enforcers' turn one enforcer fell over keeled over dead the other one is going to step back out from the inside for a second he's carrying a heavy crossbow that he has winched back pulls it up and is going to spin and-- the first person he sees coming out of there is probably going to be you beau because you are the one who's grabbing him and pulling him off the gangplank as he steps out and looks and sees you i'd say you have half cover because of the boxes that you've pulled up behind unless you want to use him as a human shield that's up to you he gets two shots natural 20 and a 17 which i don't think hits right yep that is 20 points of piercing damage you have a reaction still right you take nine points-- 15 is that how much it reduces it by total i know that's fine okay reroll 1d10 plus your monk level plus your dexterity no it's monk level and dexterity you're right you totally got it go for it all right you take seven points of piercing damage that ends that that brings us to caleb no sorry jester you're up first then caleb on beau all righty i know seriously right now you can see one guy on the boat what's the range on sacred flame he gets a what save is it constitution or is it wisdom oh a dex that would be 13 that's a failure it's all good it was a good move that's as far as you go you used the rest of your movement to get up to that point that ends your go caleb you're up this is not a moral group by any stretch of the imagination they're getting better than they used to be but man you're getting the boat in this too all right let's do it okay specify that next time but sure go for it i know you would i know that's fine you'd have to spend an action to look for it the name would be towards the back and it's facing away from you the enforcer fails so he takes the full 27 success success and failure you move behind here i'm going to roll a saving throw for the ship's sails not bad the sails do not catch fire they're charred a little bit from underneath but the ship isn't now suddenly a giant burning torchlight beacon in the middle of the fucking harbor i know i respect that that ends caleb's go captain's dead caduceus you're up yeah you're within range there you go eight points to beau where're you going okay there's caduceus finishing your go yasha's up okay if she wants to she can attempt to grapple and then pull him out of beau's grip or we can say she holds her action and then-- it gets a little weird because it's-- movement is what you pull him out of the way i'll allow it yes because he is resisting amongst her grapple as well and it's harder to do that yeah all right now it's marius's turn he's going to attempt to break free now that he's full of mind and he's freaking out what's he-- what's going-- make an acrobatics check against your athletics technically since you're both grappling either you or yasha can make the check and it's with advantage i'll say because you're both holding strength is plus three and it would be at plus six probably all right go for it travis and oh he almost rolled really high he does still manage to break free yay he's going to run the ship's not on fire but he has no reason to trust any of you and was meeting with these people if he's going to choose between the two he's going to step into the ship there he's like (panting) gets down low and is hiding but you know right where he is that brings us to the top of the round fjord your turn at that guy you can look and see now he is not the enforcer that went below deck previously he's dressed similarly but now that you get a better look at this view in the light he's somebody else there is still one person down in the ship that hits that hits roll damage yeah he has leather armor his ac is 11 he's pretty easy to hit ooh that'll do it both blasts take him down the attrition is not working well in his favor caduceus you do hear-- a ways away not here yet but you do hear some voices and footfalls armored footfalls you get the sense that zolezzo are on their way he will say on his turn when he gets there the bowmen now who've been hidden below the deck and have endured the fireball two of them are going to from their positions stand up and they're going to take shots at you (arrows firing) they have advantage on both because they were hidden from you that is a 19 to hit second one that's cocked advantage that is a 20 to hit they have sneak attack because they were hidden from you 29 points of piercing damage from those two hits the third goes and unfurls the sail and pulls the rope and it begins to unroll a little bit of wind is blowing it opens up a bit no it is fairly plain you get the sense that they're now looking for a way to get out of here ships aren't the fastest when it comes to exits but they're trying that brings us to beau and nott at the end of their turn these guys are going to move back as well and attempt to hide again they're not very good at hiding though (laughs) they rolled really bad all three of them at once a one a three and a four that's funny you see them duck down but they're all pulling out their arrow and nocking it into the bow and you can see exactly where they're hidden what's the plan beau and nott make your choices guys no the enforcer's dead fjord just blew him up on the side there's now only three bowmen on the deck and they're all hurt really badly from the fireball explosion and they all think they're hidden but they're not move around the side all right against which one go for it roll for attack with advantage because he does not see you yeah that hits so go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack the impact hits him and he falls back and hits the edge of the ship and then tumbles over and splooshes into the water behind you hear no noise okay you rush running across the gangplank as soon as you come to the edge you look down and there's one of the guys who's about to turn with his bow and goes (gasp) and sees you-- go for it roll for an attack ten misses you go and kick and the water on the slick deck makes you slip you catch yourself and don't tumble off the side-- that hits you go for one roundhouse and slip using the momentum you spin with a lower circle kick like a sweep kick which is about head level with him eight points of damage that'll do it the bowmen don't have a lot of hit points he (groan) and then falls unconscious onto the deck of the ship you do have enough movement you have 15 feet more so you leap down onto his crumpled unconscious body and his other friend is going to pull back to try and take a shot while he's backing up towards the back portion of the ship that'll hit go ahead and roll damage and so he-- you (impact sound) and he falls unconscious onto the ground he's like (startled gasping) make a persuasion check yeah you just killed or beat unconscious the guys he was coming to meet seven he right now is looking panicked and the words aren't coming through he thinks maybe you're calling him a gentleman he's like (panicked noises) and he's backing away from you all right that ends beau and nott's turn you do hear what sounds like some movement the door is partially open to the cabin below and there is light coming from the inside some sort of lantern light you hear things being moved around you have five more feet to get to the door and look beneath but you don't see anything yet well the door is on the side so you'd have to put your weight against it yeah you're up against the door that brings us to jester you can make an action to dash if you want to get there and do nothing else you're making your way across the gangplank like oh god you're just about to make it to the ship and that's the end of your bonus dash caduceus you're up no sorry caleb you can do that vax is back baby correct you can move 80 feet it's a bonus action to cast the spell oh and when you cast the spell and then as a bonus action-- oh wow so it's a dash action as the spell when it's cast as well so yeah that's 120 feet you do actually jester tumbles forward into the boat from the sheer force of caleb (zooming sound) flashing into the space all right that finishes caleb's turn from around this corner-- --begin to appear and now the zolezzo that are coming around the corner are coming forward with torches there are more a little further down the way and they're shouting out what's going on what is-- looking around they can see you fjord they can see yasha up on the side and they can see people on the ship across the way but that's their turn they've acknowledged you and they're telling you to halt and they're asking for your attention now it's going to turn to caduceus' turn they do not see you the sound you heard you couldn't quite make out the direction it's coming from but you can now hear it coming from around the edge of the street with you're stretching the cantrip a bit it's a sound like a bird caw you can't create the sound of a whole crowd screaming (door slamming sound) it does so all right go ahead and-- actually no this would be on their end it does catch their attention and they look over and the few that hadn't seen fjord now look over and see fjord on the dock as well there you go they are aware of those that are currently visible on the deck of the ship and fjord and yasha over there that ends it-- yasha's turn what's yasha going to do she doesn't need to with her speed she gets onto the ship there okay that brings us to the top of the round fjord your go as you do that the guards are going hey hey halt and they're drawing and loading crossbows you are not stopping you are not hailing you are not listening to anything they're saying they assume you are stealing a ship which you are the sails are unfurled it's still anchored you notice as you get to the dock yeah they were just starting to get the process going of getting the ship done and there is still somebody down inside rummaging through the interior yeah you as a sailor you get there and asses the situation and you're like this is going to take a little bit to get the boat out of here i mean through natural means i don't know what you have at your disposal but-- all right so you've taken your dodge action all the bowmen are gone that brings us to beau and nott yeah you're tied onto the side and then there's an anchor off the side you managed to pull it up make a strength check to see if you can get it all the way up oh sorry i misunderstood you go ahead-- not both it's an action to untie and get it off the dock okay so you shove off a bit there's still a good distance the gangplank is there so it's not right up against the dock per se there's not much you can push off of but you do manage to get it untied all right nott this is great this is d&d motherfuckers well there were a few times that vox machina was in this territory she managed to untie it from the dock itself no the gangplank is still resting-- probably okay i'll make an image of that captain guy at the end of the dock or something trying to hail them down not saying anything just doing this there you go right there at the edge of the dock all right that brings us to jester you see the guards they're arming crossbows they're running towards the dock one of them has his hands up hailing hey hey and is trying to get your attention what are you doing okay where do you want it okay very obviously run over and look like she's running over here and hiding good to know no that's the illusion all right okay go ahead and roll an attack for the ac of wood which isn't terribly high it is it has an ac that hits hits the water (sploosh) okay so two hit go ahead and roll damage 12 damage all right (explosions) the dock splinters and bits of it char and burn and go flying it (cracks) but it's still standing it wasn't enough to destroy the entire dock it's damaged okay (whoosh) you vanish inside the interior of the cabin pushing past beau who's been holding the door shut as soon as you come down inside there's a lantern and there's one of the enforcers who you can see is burning papers (gasps) you have a bonus action cantrip all right that finishes your turn that comes to the guards the guards the one who was putting his hands up and was shouting hey to hail you and was asking what's going on has no choice but to assume that you're destroying the dock and stealing a ship now because you are he's going instead to pull out his heavy crossbow and load it they're going to move up to the side here the weird butterfly effect of d&d actions all right so the guards are going to go ahead and they're all going to fire it's going to be two against you fjord two against yasha and one against marius against fjord that is a 15 and a 17 all righty you take six points of piercing damage both against jester terrible rolls that is a 12 and ten they both just (whiff) past oh no those were against yasha they could have seen you but yasha was the bigger threat but it still misses yasha last one against marius misses surprisingly with a natural seven he's just (yelps) and he's looking at all this happening he looks freaked out that's going to end the guards' turn caduceus as you are-- 30 that gets you just-- finds his own adventure (laughter) no that's it-- there is it's a closed window but you could try and break it okay so you're over on that side that's the end of your turn why not just go all in yasha all right so yasha goes over to the side pulls it up (grunts) gets it on the inside you're now currently not tethered to-- okay she's trying her best to protect marius i would say yeah the time you really miss the air ashari all right now it's marius's turn what marius was going to do he can't do now well he might try no no hold on marius moves past yasha he gets up to the top of the edge of the ship and let me roll for him to see if-- that's actually pretty good okay he glances about the scenario takes in his chances and what's happening and stands up and goes hold hold please this is a big misunderstanding let's talk this out to the guards for the sake of this i'm going to have one of you guys roll for him who wants to roll his-- persuasion check with disadvantage no because it would make it more interesting okay yeah that's not having any effect on them they're beyond convincing now it looks like yeah he did but you know that finishes the round fjord you're up sure okay you make your way down and you join up at the side of caleb you can see now the enforcer that's there throwing the paper that's currently burning onto the table and he's pulling a weapon out and he's-- you said double dash it would have taken that to get there so all right all right now as he sees you and he's pulling the blade you rush into the fray and what heavy shadows still lie in the bottom here with the little bit of lantern and fire light that's lighting the space the shadows get darker around him and you can see everyone's breath is visible suddenly in this under chamber as the curse takes its hold on him that goes to beau and nott beau has never been on a ship the one sailor is below deck right now make an intelligence check okay you look at it you've been watching boats come into harbor and you've read things about it but mostly from your observational skills which is one of your focuses and strengths beauregard you're like okay i think i've seen people you know making ships go you grab the ropes you pull and you yank past and you watch as the sail picks up the wind and stiffens it's like-- beau for those purposes up on the top there holding the rope and you're like ah okay there's a sail nott what are you doing as far as you know the gangplank is resting on there you don't know if it's connected at all you're starting to drift a little bit the wind has picked up a little bit make an athletics check to grapple straight 18 yeah like a wet paper bag he goes over ah (boof) and they both slam onto the deck below you have him grappled and you're like holding him down you're not-- you don't weigh a lot but you're leveraging and pulling the weight in a way where he can't-- his knees are buckled and he can't actually get any ground to hold himself up so you got him all right the enforcer who's below who has the curse is going to go ahead and swing forward two attacks with his blade this is going to be this is going to be against you fjord because you're the one that came in and cursed him that's going to be a 15 to hit (impact) shield off to one side natural 19 that is ten points of slashing damage you (groan) you just manage to hold on by a thread your consciousness waning your eyes focus angrily towards the target of your hexblade's curse all right that brings us to jester's turn okay ones up front the one up here is the leader the one that was guiding them on stuff he fails with a natural three two natural threes in a row fucking lucky the third one on the far end is a natural six okay so you are currently-- oh no it's not concentration for charm person those three are charmed they are technically in combat with you makes a wisdom saving throw and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it yeah there's been enough aggressive action they're considered fighting they've all failed their save i'm going to do one more roll for all of them the leader-- that's cocked that's a natural 12 plus two 14 what's your dc 15 that's a natural ten and a natural 11 they all fail again yeah they're all still charmed well done that's kind of crazy actually all right so we'll say the red here is charm person the three of them drop their weapons for a second and are looking confused the ones behind are still loading and getting ready okay that ends your turn jester caleb okay this is a natural seven that's a failure after slashing into fjord and turning towards you and seeing that fall he throws his weapon down and crawls under the table angrily like grr i'm going to get you under this table and then he gets there and looks very confused let's see here yeah we'll say that's what his next action would be since technically it's out of turn yeah it's happening simultaneously you look up and you see this scenario you see the guards are still standing there at the edge the ship is moving it's slowly pulling away that brings us to the guards' turn the two in the back are going to go ahead and fire that's going to be one at beau and one at yasha against beau that is a 17 to hit against yasha that is a 16 to hit i believe that does hit she doesn't have a huge armor class if i recall she does take only five points of piercing damage well she hasn't attacked anything did she take damage last turn oh she was attacked last turn so she's still raging but there were a few rounds there where she didn't hit anything so the rage fell oh that's true he fails so he goes to fire and he has to choose another target it's okay it's a 1st-level spell instead he's going to fire that at yasha as well okay that is a failure that is a natural seven no damage outside of the damage that she took there at that point the leader goes wait hold what are you doing stand back and the guy's like what are you talking about hold on we have to figure this out something is strange about this hold up he starts shouting to hail in your direction and the other guards are putting their weapons away and are about to walk over the two in the back are like what yeah they are not sure what's happening they are not perceptive enough to have seen that it's a spell effect that has changed them they're confused by it we'll see if they figure it out soon with that these guys are going to begin to walk and make their way toward the broken docks they see the illusory guy there and look confused there's the guy just waving to them that's all he's doing repeatedly he's like one of those mannequins holding the electrical signs on the street yeah he's a wacky waving-- a half-orc these guards are going to chase up confused and they're going sir sir sir and they're not entirely certain what's going on they're really confused by the scenario that's going to go to caduceus 25 30 oh this way 25 30 it's a ten-foot drop yep sure make an athletics check nine you slip and fall a little bit you get down about five feet and you make a splash sound yeah they don't notice five ten 15 20 yeah you're slowly wading through the water okay that ends you're go yasha's turn yasha as far as you know does not know boats she's never mentioned anything about it and yasha looks like she doesn't know what she's doing she's not giving orders or rushing to take a post yasha will go ahead and push on the gangplank make a strength check for yasha shoving off she shoves and the whole boat shifts suddenly the gangplank plunges down into the water and it's floating there on the top the ship gets shoved off about ten feet in that direction all right all right and he stays quiet there and doesn't do anything fjord 15 feet of movement to get up there you have 15 more feet of movement and you have an action you get up and man it it starts arcing and making its way in that direction turning slowly okay fjord in a fit of frustration and anger once the rudder is locked in place and the ship begins to turn in position bashes his head in very much a this is so stupid movement it doesn't knock you unconscious but you are dizzy as fuck you have you hit your head real hard on there to do a point of damage do you want to do that frustration you'll hurt yourself but to take a point of damage you're like ugh there's a little bit of blood trickling out from where the head got mashed a little bit the partially splintered wood from the explosion of the fireball earlier that ends fjord's turn now the ship is moving on initiative 20 the ship moves out and is over there now and is turning this way that brings us to beau and nott you're just using your action to hold onto the sail and keep it open you're the only one really listening to the thing you eventually get her to figure it out you get the sail situated and that will be your action for the turn okay nott there is a couple of coils of rope left there in the far corner of the-- you'll have to release him to go get it still holding him because he's keeping quiet the rope hovers over and plops next to you okay go ahead and make a sleight of hand check for me well just a general dexterity check actually you're not proficient in this necessarily so just add your dexterity modifier okay you've begun the process it's not an immediate-- you're not a master of rope tying necessarily this round the ropes are slipping and while marius is fighting against it a little bit you're not getting too much of a hold on it all right that ends your go the enforcer below who has completed the-- now is when he's ducked behind because he lost his action to do that he now gets under the table throws his weapon down and goes what the fuck goes to pick up the weapon that's his turn jester you go it's so ridiculous no but he performed the action yeah spell ends the leader goes no who considers you a friend at the moment and is seemingly really distraught to watch this happen i take it you're not concentrating on your silent image anymore okay that vanishes right as she kills herself and falls into the water very confused okay you move up to the door and-- holding it there you're keeping low yeah it's half movement you still get there and you're prone all right caleb no how it works is you give them a task he went and hid under the table for safety which he did but it wasn't specific enough it wasn't a very specific suggestion no you locked him down there you're in here with me all right you put out the fire you can see now it looks like what was a map that is mostly burned entirely on the map yeah you see part of the coast and you see some notes and you see something on there clearly looking at it there is information on it but you're putting it out (blowing) that's going to be your turn that brings us to the guards' turn the guards in the back are shaking the other guard what are you doing they're getting away he's like look this is a very confusing scenario and we're trying to ascertain what's happening they seem safe for now but why did this dock explode she just killed herself go check on her make sure she's okay the guard's like-- natural 20 they're like this is foul magic he starts slapping him in the face and he's like get away and he's like call a mage we have to get this taken care of they start shouting for help frumpkin's still hanging out over here i figured you would've blinked frumpkin you still have an octopus frumpkin with you the guards are now-- yeah they're momentarily distracted by all the things that have happened the ship getting away and their leader's essentially acting really dumb and now ascertaining that it's magical they don't know what to do so they're starting to shout out and one of them's starting to leave and go to get help they start darting this way shouting these guys all begin to inspect and try to see if they can find the poor woman this guy dives into the water to try and see if he can save her (laughter) that's their action caduceus 30 that's as much as you can get it's half movement in the water (laughter) yeah there's a single torch over here that is loosely lighting the vicinity for caduceus-- you do have a high passive perception there are shapes in the water below no they weren't immediately-- at night no you're getting out under the dock and you-- and a little bit of light that's coming through from the moonlight you look and you can see something in the water that ends your turn yasha's go sure you're just holding the ship not much else to do all right so at this point marius is-- there's not much else he can do fjord your turn all right make a perception check please 18 you do you do see-- (laughter) (laughter) i'm so happy this went so far from any of my expectations i love dungeons & dragons all right so keeping up with that that ends fjord's turn the boat now moves on initiative count 20 to there all right beau and nott we'll say for the purposes of expediency on this you felt the door go (thump) that's all you know you don't see caleb on the ship where's caleb okay caleb's standing there all right caleb you doing anything yeah he's making his way up the stairs after you go ahead roll for attack oh that's right ah it's cocked natural six well yeah scurvy you know 17 points of damage (crash) right in the back of the skull he's like ahh and you can see him holding back he's holding the sword he's hurt but he's still coming at you (laughs) all right with an immediate burst of speed in a rush very akin to the flash making his way through the city caleb just (poof) appears there on top with fjord and beau the guy who's now looking at you jester you see the guy had his sword out and ah looks confused and sees you and goes (growls) and is going to come up with the sword he doesn't realize how fucked he is he doesn't know that the ship has been taken he's feeling pretty competent probably all right so on that he's going to go ahead and make his way towards you jester he comes up and is going to make two swings at you well first you have to see if it hits that is going to be a 15 to hit i believe that misses that's a 19 to hit all right go for it that is ten points of slashing damage to you a two-handed (whoosh) swings past you he has to make a save right that is a natural 14 but has no bonus to his dex so it's a 14 right because it's a racial ability he takes half damage what is it all right ice shards pierce out of the blast area and his body is (groans) he's looking really hurt now and he's frustrated and his eyes are starting to go a little wild realizing that this is turning on him pretty heavily all right caduceus (counting) you're just like (breathing hard) as you glance over-- all right yasha goes up and brings caduceus back onto the ship you have a bonus action all right you got it fjord seven points to you fjord anything just keeping the ship going on this way the boat continues on for another 20 or 30 feet-- actually 30 feet it's starting to get a little speed and it's picking up the wind as it's making its way curving out towards the harbor the guards continue running off these guys are all searching for the body of the woman the enforcer actually technically would have his attack on this round i missed that the enforcer does his attacks on you jester yeah you can it's your turn now you get one attack make an intimidation check 13 he doesn't buy it he's like back in-- the deck isn't very high he can't really look and see the ship before you entirely he's just seeing you right there in the way he's just hacking at you with his sword so the words don't come through he thinks it's a bluff caleb you are down next to her persuasion disadvantage yeah what did you roll no you guys are all standing on the door and going like come on bud come on he's going no no you're lying yeah the guards aren't an issue anymore at the moment caduceus anything you need to do or you just holding on the ship got you all right bringing it back fjord anything holding the ship ship continues off you guys are picking up speed now as the wind has come in and the ship is now making its way you turned it around a little bit that was going bad oh yeah that's why i love when shit goes wrong like this these are my favorite moments in d&d the enforcer is going to go ahead and take two more attacks on you you know what no he does see caleb now actively takes a look behind and then turns around and runs down below deck he's running down below deck you do get an attack of opportunity if you want to take it jester yeah that'll hit go ahead and roll damage as he turns around you're like no wait (shunk) into the back of his skull he falls and (thump) slides down the stairs limply i mean you put an axe to the back of his head you didn't say that out loud it's not your turn you don't have a bonus action because it's a reaction you wouldn't be able to use it until next round the ac of wood is a good alpha title as you pull away out into the main harbor fjord for the first time in a long time you feel-- as the stress of the sequence passes over you the sensation of being at the helm of a ship bypasses the momentary frustration it feels good to feel that wind in your hair again and to be guiding it through the waters and seeing the dark horizon in the distance you feel that bald rage subside looking past you can see the guards are still running up the streets with their torches there'll probably be a search party marisha and the good news is you don't think they were paying attention to the back of he ship thanks to the distraction that you set so they don't know the name of the ship that might help to your advantage it is called-- no it is not it is called the mist with a i now pushing past midnight to the very early morning hours you make your way out and as far away from the edge you can see the lights of nicodranas begin to fade a bit just enough where you can feel comfortable marius is there bound by ropes there still wild eyed and looking at all this all right then who the fuck are you my name is marius lepual what did i do i'm very confused he looks around he's like i was coming to tell some business contacts of mine that something they hired me for didn't pan out i don't know they're very mysterious okay he goes why didn't you say that in the beginning i don't know a gentleman i just know that i was supposed to look for that delivery whoever was going to bring it i didn't expect for you to come in here and slaughter my contacts nothing i was going to make some coin pass it over that was it i don't know mysterious folk it was supposed to come find me in the cove never showed up and they had been waiting in town for a few days and they were coming back and i-- this was the night where i was supposed to tell them-- either bring it to them or the deal was off and i was supposed to give back the money that i owed them so--  i know that i am very well aware of that right now i'm a little freaked out not going to lie make an intimidation check he goes right i'm being truthful i know it was supposed to be for a captain captain avantika she's a right intense person i've only seen her once she doesn't really leave her ship in port when she's in which is rare her reputation keeps her not from coming in directly well her ship is the squall eater she's a bit of a forceful taker of things she wants that's one word to say it if you want to find her your best bet is probably somewhere in the swavain islands don't know where directly i'm just hired as the errand boy swavain s-w-a-v-a-i-n i was just supposed to come back here supposed to meet up with the folks of the mist the ship that you've now commandeered you've killed them all what are you going to do with me i'm useful i'm helpful i can swab the deck i can cook what you got yeah yeah you did make an investigation check okay you find a pouch of 20 platinum pieces you find another pouch that's hidden within his belt pouch that contains 62 gold pieces three silver 50 copper and what looks to be a pouch of chewing tobacco well so you're not going to kill me right that's fine that's good odds i'll take those odds can you at least loosen these a bit as yasha picks him up and ties him to the mast he's like oh okay well where are we going then no i don't know an ionos as you guys all head down below deck to take in what exactly you have at your disposal as you are now the current owners of the mist professor thaddeus is somewhere at the city make an animal handling check not while fighting total of what 19 you're shouting out to the sky time passes no professor thaddeus as you head down below deck to take stock of what you have we're going to end there we'll pick up next week thank you that was fun who knows he got splattered no he didn't he was going to be the nasty one anyways well done guys you have a boat and a handful of people in the city that saw your faces most of your faces you have a weasel and your mom has a puppy and there's an owl somewhere that's up to you guys to figure out next time we come around
