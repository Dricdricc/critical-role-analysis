tv static] [groovy critical role theme] if i recall you guys had taken a long rest after your previous battle so now it's mid-morning i'd say what is your marching order if i could ask all righty who's in the lead guys taliesin and all right nott and kiri will stay with jester and frumpkin got it fjord does that mean you're leading through who's responsible for navigating make a survival check please very good you follow the pearl-handled daggers along the treeline until eventually you break southward to the northern side of the ounterloch you continue to follow it southwestward from your current position curving around the outside of the lake eventually you make your way back to the treeline where you were before at one point there's a faint shift in the greenery-- looks like a vine maybe has moved-- and you recognizing the placement of it manage to stop fjord from stepping into it as you pull him back you guys watch as there is now a cluster of vines at the base of one of these trees and what looks like thorns on them appear to be jagged and in rows-- you don't know you saw a patch of vines that were tangled at the base of one of these trees that you managed to stop fjord before stepping into the area make a nature check make a perception check you don't see anybody responsible for that all right make an investigation check does not appear to be trapped there are no other cables or lines you don't see any signs of anything else either holding any tautness to it they seem slack as you look at them they're just centered there at the base they either might be coming out from under the tree or part of a plant network right there as soon as you hear beau's words it's good jerky you watch as the vines suddenly wrap around where it was and begin to coalesce and twist around it you watch as they tighten and tear and hold there then they begin to slowly shift in your direction the vines-- (moving noises) it's not very quick you watch as this poor cluster of jagged vines different than the man-trap you'd encountered before slowly circle around and eventually give up after you guys very easily make your distance doesn't seem to have much interest in them unfortunately pressing on you're heading back to berleben or are you searching for this hollow you found before make another survival check for me please you have firm memory of directions you know which direction you're traveling and you have-- yeah you don't have the ability to suddenly know where everything is that you've been you have a good sense of it and you can guide better than most given most circumstances but you also have not grown up in a swamp and after a while the pattern recognition begins to fade a bit and you discover after you've been circling for a bit stumbling upon your own footfalls you've lost about two hours of travel in the middle of the swamp laura and knowing that you do take knowledge of the current source of sunlight above the canopy following that heading in the western direction from where you were eventually you come across that similar sound distant chimes so are you all staying back how far back are you staying here this will make it easy to establish the scenario there is the hollow with the central tree there you guys are coming this direction so north would be that direction you guys are heading this way where would you guys like to be placed it's normal ground where it's green and then rough terrain where it's water kiri has her dagger out and is currently-- there there you go as you're preparing yourself kiri looks over to you with a big smile with the dagger out and goes (as jester) i don't know if it's smart roll your stealth with advantage nott as you come up along the side it's not plus ten all right as quietly as you can you turn around the corner walk this little swampy land bridge dipping down to about your waist in swamp water but in a very slow steady path begin to emerge your foot finding the roots at the base of this large now hollowed tree you turn around the corner-- that's true you do actually so you (tip tap) across it the softest ninja run you've ever seen you can almost hear dance of the sugar plum fairies as you go glancing inside you do see currently in the process of chewing something you hear a crunching sound and then a slurping sound and then some subtle (eating noises) do you want to hold actions when it comes to it essentially it would be a surprise round so you wouldn't have to worry about holding necessarily he doesn't seem to know you're there do you have flint and steel in your equipment nott scoots back around the corner as you guys are all waiting patiently it's about that long make an intelligence check actually 11 you have some understanding of basic alchemy you know probably the way this is treated it won't burn super fast you're not sure you could have anywhere between 24 to six seconds once lit wait so where are you then okay so you move over both swords ignited so you move over here with yasha then okay there's now this floating piece of dynamite just kind of gliding over the swamp you hear the insects buzzing and various dragonflies making their way through so you have it now floating in front of you yasha it's going okay you get right around this corner make another stealth check as you've now dilly-dallied around for a bit okay no idea you're there but there is a faint (hissing) sound and from the inside you see the shifting movement of the large hulking troll beast on the inside of the hollow kind of pause for a second in the middle of chewing silence if i could get a pair of scissors please well yeah you blew it apart (laughter cheering) okay so first off-- disadvantage on its dexterity saving throw fails go ahead and roll 2d6 for me please a concussive blast blows apart the hollow you see pieces of shrapnel go flying in every direction the only one who is not currently protected is you nott i need you to make a dexterity saving throw please well not from the blast this is from the shrapnel of the tree hollow that has exploded outwards in all directions you're far enough away where i don't think it would get to you that's okay you take half damage you take three points of bludgeoning damage from pieces of wood flying in your direction the troll is however knocked prone (cheering) from a distance yeah however i need everyone to roll initiative he's aware that you guys are there now we'll say for the purposes of this i'll give you each one action to do something 25 to 20 a natural 20 on his-- sorry caleb was and nott was it 20 to 15 15 to ten ten to five what you got fjord i think this is a surprise round the troll cannot act this turn we'll just let it go that way because he'd be going up with you caleb on the same turn he's on the ground dazed and stunned what are you doing 22 points of fire damage nice the bolt impacts the flame curls across his now currently black blasted chest and back area the flames as you noticed in a previous battle has prevented its regeneration from the battles you've had and from watching the previous strike you now notice the impact and as the time progresses over the next round the wounds are not knitting themselves back together so that finishes your turn are you going to move finishing caleb's go nott you're up you have disadvantage because he's currently prone i just wanted to see if you rolled lower good to know first shot misses i'm letting you guys have a full surprise round because technically he's dazed 13 does not hit it manages to ricochet off of the outer parts of its hide even though it's burnt and scarred it's still thick you watch as the bolt reflects off it molly you're up and then beau spell dc on that is charisma-based so it's a ten correct all of your racial abilities are charisma-based that is a 12 so it does not succeed no sorry i mean-- meaning your ability does not succeed that's your action you still have 25 feet of movement if you want do anything perfect that finishes molly's turn beau you're up keeping on the green you can get about there and he is within 20 feet of you you have disadvantage on the attacks because he's prone 19 hits 14 misses unfortunately but the first strike does hit four points of damage to the troll as you throw it you watch as it splinters off of its body and there is a splash of poisonous toxin all right you go into your defensive stance preparing for any sort of assault towards you yasha you're up no you didn't if you want to yeah all right there you go yasha it's up to you if you don't move you don't get to move later until your next turn so if you're going to move do it now and then hold your action for whatever trigger you want over here and you're holding an attack okay you are readying an attack for what what's the trigger comes within range got it okay that finishes yasha's turn jester you're up right above it all right roll for your attack correct technically it's at advantage because it is prone i imagine it's considered a melee attack taliesin and that definitely hits roll damage on that 12 points of damage as the lollipop (whack) slams down onto its body it rears back this awkward sickly looking creature being bashed by beautiful glistening divine lollipop it's a unique visual you mean you used your bonus action for the spirit and your action for the-- wisdom or constitution wisdom all right that is a four yeah it is apparently all righty that ends jester's go all righty fjord you're up all righty strength checks are denied onto him for disadvantage go for it both at disadvantage misses over top that does hit roll damage a d6 from your hex don't forget that 11 technically no he's all right i mean he looks hurt top of the round caleb and the troll going at the same time because you are going at the same time with the enemy roll a dexterity check roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier he's going before you gets up in its space that's half his movement (counting) 15 it's going to use an action to dash forward in front of you sam and you know what he's not he's going to stay there and instead he's going to go ahead and use his venom spray it lumbers forward it's darkened with angry blasted soot and flame scars it rumbles toward you its strange bulbous midsection wobbling as it steps through the swamp towards you it looks like an even more swollen meg mucklebones from legend reaches up with its claw and tears a giant wound across its chest as it does dark green venomous liquid sprays out in a 15-foot cube in front of it hitting both of you i need you both to make a constitution saving throw please it takes seven points of damage from its own claw okay you just make it the dc was 16 that is exactly what you needed 18 points of poison damage to you yasha and you are poisoned for one minute sam and you take nine points of poison damage beau and you are not poisoned yep at the end of each turn you can repeat the saving throw to try and get rid of the poison so that's going to end its turn next caleb right there what level three missiles 3d4 plus three go ahead and roll that up nott you're up next finishing that caleb your turn's over nott what are you doing nope that does miss unfortunately each magic missile the spray is still jumping off of its body in these very proximity-based sprays of terrible toxin so yeah it's still happening are you only making the one attack over here as you're rushing past correct six points of damage to it as the bolt sticks in the back you watch as one of its bulbous pustules sprays venom behind it impacting nothing in its proximity between five and ten feet you're not entirely certain from your visible standpoint because you're kneeling behind a tree with partial cover that finishes nott's turn molly you're up then beau you're on deck 30 feet in order to make it with your distance you're going to have to leap across that bit of open swamp water that'll be the rest of your movement you'll be right there and that'll be the end of your movement okay make an athletics check (counting) you trip and fall down to your knees in the water 20 25 and that's about as far as you can move on this turn you can use an action to dash if you want okay you're holding your attack got it okay does that end your turn beau you're up your first attempt to spray it it dissipates in front of you you can't throw it 15 feet to land on his body you have to throw the actual-- all right roll a d20 plus your dexterity modifier it sees it coming towards it and (whooshing) past its head and you hear it (shattering) somewhere in the distance you glance past it and there's a pile of skulls and bones that were previously charred from the impact that currently now are doused in oil how much full movement all right that ends beau's turn end of beau yasha you're up you can sure i'll let you do that yeah you who are still holding your tinder box from lighting the dynamite earlier pull out your pack pull out a torch and it begins to burn roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier it does you see behind a pile of freshly dampened oil-covered skulls burns like a nice little bonfire behind him it looks at it and looks back at you about as incredulously as a troll can like-- i should have actually rolled at disadvantage on that but it would have been the same you do at the end of your turn make a constitution saving throw you manage to shrug off the poison good all right that ends yasha's turn jester you're up 14 just misses it strikes across its shoulder but glances off and slams into the wet sickening swamp floor with a (sucking) sound it has to pull itself out by wedging back and forth oh shit all right roll your attack you watch as behind (booming) a tree blasts back from the guiding bolt slamming into already rotted roots needed that one final nudge and the tree behind uproots itself and falls all right that ends jester's turn fjord you're up go for it level one what level you have to 16 does hit plus a d6 because it has hex on it 20 points of damage i'm putting this on there for witch bolt so if you wanted to use your action again you can continue to hit it every turn for a d12 automatically now you see as fjord steps around the corner and releases this arcing bolt of purplish-black energy this lightning arcs off and slams into the troll the energy continues to swirl around it it tries to stop it and grasp for it to no effect there's this strange thread of faintly visible energy between it and fjord right now there's some sort of connection between the two of them all right that ends your turn fjord the troll's going to go first because it rolled higher than caleb immediately it turns-- no it's real angry at him because it just got hexed blasted and then bolted it's going to bypass the shiny swords right there it does you were holding your action so you get two attacks yeah that does hit ten points of damage as you strike it with one blade and miss with another immediately as you strike across it with your blade the venom splashes into your face you suffer 13 points of poison damage and then it moves out of your combat range you can still take your reaction if you wanted to yep it does not appear to be undead so it's 2d6 plus and then double whatever you roll yeah if you wanted to do it that way as you carve past with a third final swing towards it you cut through a portion of muscle and tendon on its arm there which immediately slips dull to one side unmoving the spray splashes back in your face for only five points of poison damage and it's coming into you as soon as that arm goes limp the muscle reconnects and the arm comes back with strength angrily it's going to swing it's going to take a bite and two claw attacks against you you can't you already used your reaction to attack him sorry buddy for its bite attack against you its jaws open fjord that is going to be a 26 you take ten points of piercing damage plus six points of poison damage and you are poisoned until the start of its next turn as the venom courses through your veins its teeth and giant tusks dug into the front of your shoulder and chest the pain is strong but it's holding you fast from there like a clawed wolverine it begins to rake at your chest with its claws on each side the first one's going to be a 16 to hit right because you have your shield out the shield blocks one of the claws the other one attempts to reach behind it to get to your body that's going to be a 19 with the other claw strike-- no he is not that is nine plus four 13 points of slashing damage and another three points of poison damage that's going to end its turn laura and caleb you're up wisdom save that is a 14 minus one 13 no half movement he can only make a single attack on its turn i need you to make two concentration checks by the way your hex would be gone technically which is my fault hex is gone and make constitution saving throws to see if you're maintaining your witch bolt all righty good on you i assumed as much okay correct all right caleb that finish your turn nott you're up it is all righty you move (counting) 30 there you go that hits roll damage it's hurt real bad now 17 points of damage and splash fjord you take nine points of poison damage right into your face as the bolt slashes through it's holding on barely it's right there angrily making a last stand okay roll damage six points still alive fjord you take another 13 points of poison damage it's standing heavily breathing like (panting) you do you're about to go-- (straining) the orc comes to the blood of the half-orc kicks in and you stand there angrily in its face all righty that finishes nott's turn molly you're up you're up to your waist in swamp water looking up at it 20 that hits how do you want to do this as you stab through its body it tries to spin and you watch this strange tensing of its abdominal muscles and its weird bulbous stomach suddenly bursts out in front of you fjord yeah you take ten points of poison damage it looked almost like molly killed them both fjord is currently unconscious on the ground guys what are you doing as far as you know you don't know okay so roll a constitution saving throw to resist it 20 so you watch as where the snake is the blood bursts and the green venom that's currently coursing through the wounds in fjord's unconscious body suddenly (sucking noise) siphons out hovers in the air for a moment as mollymauk is holding his hand and then the poison drops to the ground and disseminates into the swamp what are you guys doing fjord is still unconscious the poison's gone but he's-- make a perception check you guys begin to make your way over to the-- kiri begins to run around joining over here in the swamp area (like jester) it's poisonous you're looking down at it and watching as parts of the wounds are still tethering together it hasn't come back to your turn yet unfortunately its turn's before that you watch as it suddenly comes up from the ground pulling itself from the swamp now conscious once more and it's going to take another heavy swing towards fjord with advantage because you're prone that's going to be 20 to hit that's going to be seven points of piercing damage and two points of poison fjord falls unconscious once more well it comes back around to the next turn as soon as it comes back it heals ten hit points back up so it came to consciousness just enough movement to get up from prone knock fjord down it's going to make another swipe at fjord no it can't it's still slowed yeah oh man and it had a third attack but it doesn't anymore all right fjord is unconscious brings us back caleb it is now your turn as everyone's rushed around it's got back up and just (slamming noise) fjord's unconscious again it seemed to any sort of damage seemed to cause it to splurt no that was its turn it just took so now we're going back to the initiative order again real fast hold on i'm just checking slow it gets to make a wisdom saving throw to see if it can avoid slow no it rolled a three so caleb what are you doing okay what are you doing okay so you're holding until fjord is clear from his body got it okay that brings us to nott nott what are you doing you turn around and watch as the troll's now back up and slammed its claw into fjord's now once again unconscious body currently you can very easily get within 30 feet you step around the flaming pile of skulls right there and turn and get another bolt and-- you're holding okay holding the attack until fjord's safe you got it all right molly your turn you can where do you want to go right behind the fire all right that finishes molly's turn beau you're up figure it out guys it's your turn 25 30 you don't even have to to get to it oh to get to fjord sorry 40 50 that's 60 (counting) 40 so you have that's your-- okay so you spend an action just to hold onto him you currently have him grappled okay got it yasha all right so you move over action and you're going to pull him away all righty you are not in melee range so you manage to pull him back here fjord you get-- i know he doesn't so you pull him back fjord is now right there hmm it gets a little wonky with action but i'll let you do it with the speed you have left you guys can pull him about there well it's half speed through the swamp and then it's half speed dragging somebody so it's a slow shift because you're moving through the muck and dragging him out of this thick swamp so that's as far as you can get it does not get any reaction though because it's currently still affected by the slow spell and it looks like right now fjord is in a position where he is outside of the splash radius which would trigger caleb and nott you fire and you are using the scorching ray from the glove all hit roll damage no there's nobody in range of it right now five points of damage it's still conscious how do you want to do this as you turn the glove sparking as you release these three blasts one strikes his chest and ignites his arm begins to burn black this one hits the other shoulder and you watch as the torso begins to ignite the third one finally hits right in the jaw and you see the shadowed line of its face eyes and mouth open before (fire crackling) incinerated to ash i need you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw please caleb's arms kind of just fall slack and he slumps to his knees staring at the now-flaming corpse of the troll as it slumps into the ground and begins to burn half-submerged in swamp water half of it now just this burning mass of ash and flesh so go ahead and make a death saving throw yeah you're fine all right it's fine i just like making him roll you pull him away he's not present currently you have to wait a moment because currently the body is being engulfed eventually the flames die down to the point where you can carve into its body but most of its flesh is burned it's definitely dead make a medicine check you manage to eventually hack away get to where the troll heart would be and carve it out without damaging it beyond any interest in this piece it's a deep forest green looks like it has half-formed additional ventricles that never fully completed it's pretty disgusting and you go to touch it and your fingers-- okay you pull it out it is corroding the cloth slowly it's that big it's about basketball size okay both of you guys make investigation checks as you're looking through the rest of that yasha what are you doing unfortunately the concussive blast of the dynamite shattered most of the bones and any materials that were in here so what would've at one time been fairly easy to scavenge what remains you gather from the patches of now dried and destroyed swamp ground that much of it has been scattered all across you do manage to find some coins between the two of you-- mostly you nott-- and it takes some digging you're basically having to pan for gold here you're going in the muck and having to sift through your fingers and pour your water out a bit take it into the water you manage to find roughly 26 gold pieces ten silver pieces and let's say about 50 copper pieces the body of the troll make another investigation check there's basic hides wrapped around the midsection there is a small pouch you go inside and pull through and immediately your hands hit something that feels very cold and somewhat slimy looking inside looks like there are slivers of muscle fresh muscle that had been torn off of some sort of a body laid in there the smell is a little bit putrid it may have been in there pickling for a while you can make a medicine check to try and identify it ten probably human caleb you shake out of it yeah okay that it does in revealing the partially singed troll dong you also manage to properly wrap the heart for its own use each campaign it's a through line guys so fjord what are you doing okay caleb you manage to snap out of it and come back to reality it's a pile of bone and skull shards that is still burning and will be burning for a while from the oils no that flask shattered on impact sorry you guys take a short rest the downside of throwing dynamite into the reward pile you guys finish your short rest you're feeling a little more collected what do you wish to do you look around and see kiri sitting there with the knife and is stabbing the troll body it's not splashing venom it looks like (like caleb) this means we are friends (like jester) don't stab humans don't eat humans okay no it seems classic fjord stomach nine all right you guys continue making your way back towards berleben you made most of the journey and by the time the sky begins to subtly grow dark with the threat of dusk imminent in the next hour or so you guys begin to make visual on the lantern lights in the outskirts of the northern side of the city within a short time before it gets too dark in the swamp you manage to make your way inside berleben proper you're still in the puddles okay he cannot respond though right oh can answer in a like manner immediately seeing as how the spell's limit is 25 words-- (laughter) as you guys are having this conversation near one of the lanterns you see a cloaked figure that's sitting on a bench suddenly stand up and face you and begin to walk towards you you're walking through the puddles the figure approaches somebody in the tech sneezed i think i know the figure approaches and pulls the hood back and you see a scruffy chin the unkempt hair a dirtier but excited horris thrym he goes well word of a motley group of strangers spreads in whispers and i knew it had to be you based on the description my friends you've come this way this place is miserable oh do not think that i don't appreciate what you've done for me please as rough as this journey was i'd rather be here than in prison what word of zadash has come is dolan all right i've heard whispers of that as well i've been here for over a week so no but i'm sure there was how long should i stay what is the current atmosphere there is it safe to return or should i hang low a little longer okay i'll remain in this quaint city that's true i'll be patient thank you all so much i really appreciate it no i don't but if i do i'll let you know  i genuinely wish to make this up to you at some point if it is diamonds you require i'll begin looking he stops and looks around the city and goes i don't know if this is the place call me crazy but-- fish swamp fungus herbs he steps back he starts thinking for a second then goes maybe there and points to what is another two story building that had been burned and left to rot that now appears to be a hollow structure that is overgrown with greenery and plants it seems to be from what i've noticed in passing thank you thank you all if you see dolan tell him please come get me thank you i'm over at the drowned nest marisha and no they're better than that place and he points to the keystone pub where you guys stayed the night not to my standards i'm sure you could acquire a drink trust me most of the folks here have to just precautions not a lot of business happens here that you won't get mingled in unless you were looking so i just stay put you as well if you pass by the drowned nest hopefully we could have a drink and he makes his way up towards the central part of the town the midway docks you approach and there is a sign that's hanging from a chain from two iron hooks that are long rusted this dull brown-red color it reads across the front the fungal fount never enter if it's papyrus so you approach the door is closed currently sorry we're closed we're closed it's sundown and i'm shutting up sunrise (pause) what make a persuasion check you are helping i'll give you advantage on this roll that was a roller coaster right there there's a moment and you hear (multiple locks clicking) the door opens and on the inside you see a wild-looking gaunt dwarf he has a chin beard with green moss growing on each side of it his clothes look a little moist and his forehead glistens with sweat and he peers through his eyes popped out you said you have a troll heart come in opens the door and lets you both inside closes the door behind (lock clicking) i'm sort of curious as to how you came across this troll heart did you kill the troll that's amazing i'm very impressed um ah-- i would like to very much place it on this counter please on the leather which you carried he reaches over and grabs metal tongs and starts pushing-- i'm inspecting it takes a moment to look around i can see there's some very fascinating applications that could come from this it is quite exquisite i would be happy to buy this off of you do you have an asking price or would you like me to make an offer without breaking eye contact he starts rummaging behind this small wooden table that acts as his counter which has a bunch of planters and potted weird-looking swamp fungus and plants that are grown together and entwined one of them you lean close and a little spore goes off and you back away carefully you hear the clinking of glass and he pulls up two small jars opens and says i could spend the night preparing perhaps for some medicinal potions  strongest you'll find this side of the labenda i don't know i have to brew it to find out it's not a perfect art form you are impatient unusual right the morning then smithe smithe durban pleasure to meet you they haven't invented the zipper yet so it's laced very well goodnight sleep well return please closes the door (multiple locks clicking) so what are you guys doing for the evening you head to the midway docks following the outskirts of the drydocks which are a number of these wooden docks that head out into various edges of the swamp where there are small boats that are currently roped off and being watched by the crownsguard that come across with torches make sure that nothing gets stolen or anyone is doing anything untoward over in the area asking around you eventually find your way to a relatively simple-looking building single story but it stretches quite a bit and you can see a number of windows that are faintly glowing with candlelight on the inside it does appear to be a simple inn with a small bar in the far corner it's better than the keystone pub but only incrementally entering inside it's relatively quiet looks to be one person who is drinking alone on the far end and you see across the way a female human in her middle age a warm smile with a cracked face who glances up from a small book that she is thumbing through and goes good evening folks can i help you well i can provide both my name is uma cole pleasure to meet you oh no i keep quite clean i was trying to process what that was referring to oh you stop no the hand was clean we do have about four rooms available for rent if y'all are willing to stay for the evening our selection of liquors and beers are not extremely versatile but welcome to provide as needed very well that will be five silver per room for the night's stay all four rooms that will be two gold pieces please what a gentleman well good for you course not i'm sorry here're your keys strangely surrounded by a group of strangers now accosting her with various degrees of insinuation drinks-wise we prefer more hard liquors or more of an ale beer marisha liam and well only a couple of surprises at my disposal but-- she pulls up this dark green bottle and uncaps it it's beer but its practically ginger ale not very alcoholic she hands it over to you a round of liquor for all of you guys will run you about three silver pieces it's not very expensive oh nothing and she tucks it under just keeping my mind busy anyway welcome to stay if you like we don't have food available here you may have to go over to the keystone pub for that but we do offer finer sleeping arrangements not to the degree that you have no kiri at this point is leaning up on the counter towards the woman and goes (like jester) don't eat humans okay the woman goes aw make a deception check she goes children and their costumes she grabs her book and starts reading from behind the counter actually it's just plain leather so what are you guys doing you got your drinks they're functional at best this isn't a bad establishment but it's a plain establishment but it works it's you guys and one other patron who currently seems to be deep in their cups making it on their own they are out of earshot you have your own table okay she goes oh of course i'll go ahead and get that for you she closes the book and puts it beneath the counter and runs off and grabs the bottle that she had previously poured and shakes it it's fairly empty so she grabs another and then heads over to your table and begins to uncork and fill the drinks okay you do not see where it is you still have to have visual make a stealth check okay she walks and is pouring drinks and looks over her shoulder in your direction and is still pouring but is looking at you apparently you do see it from your perspective but she is watching you make a persuasion check she finishes pouring the drinks caps it up and goes well i appreciate the flattery i really do have a wonderful night then walks back towards where she was sitting but as she does so her eyes are locked on you nott goes back to her stool can i help you roll a persuasion check she's had a bad series of minutes with you guys i'm reading a fine story it is i had to order this from zadash unfortunately well the order goes out there and pay upon delivery it took me the better part of a month to get here i'm about three chapters in it's just starting to get interesting yes make a perception check there's a little bit of text just barely visible at this proximity to the cover of the book but you can't make it out in this low light she takes it and closes it and puts it beneath the counter is there anything else i can help you with sweetie she's just pulled the book out and looks up and goes hi make an intimidation check well it depends on how you're being intimidating are you going to physically threaten her to show the book then it's charisma-based this is subtle she goes i apologize but-- (southern drawl) i apologize but your behavior paid customer or not has been lackluster and i would appreciate if i could have my privacy why are you so interested in what i'm reading dungeons and dragons all right you guys finish up your respective drinks she palms the two gold she goes it's called feathered leather she pockets the gold happily some bard somewhere in the past has penned a story about a dark knight in leather and feathers you guys manage to get your evening's rest you gather your things and the next morning-- as you're talking you hear in your mind this gasp jester i don't know how but it's so good to hear from you did you get my package she pauses well wherever you are i love you and i hope you are well if-- and it cuts off i wasn't counting the words but i think that gets the gist of it probably somewhere in there i'm sure i'll get 14 tweets going like that was only 22 words it's fine i know oh i know taliesin that's why i'm nipping this in the bud yeah as it emerges from your grasp you can see there's the slight splash of sea water across the wall there you can see in the center of the pommel-- previously was just the well-crafted hilt to the blade-- you see a single yellow lidless eye on each side make an arcana check there's no religious symbology here in thinking through there's nothing that gives you the essence that there's any sort of belief system locked into this that you're aware of looking at it one it immediately reminds you of whatever it is he jammed into his stomach and two the image of it and the sea-based theme of these experiences that fjord has been having leads you to believe that this is something very old and something that resides probably beyond land and possibly beyond the sea that's as much as i can give you which is more than you should've gotten but you rolled a 20 currently it's just static okay for the next minute you have advantage on your charisma checks it doesn't do anything to you it just gives him advantage on charisma checks you're doing charm person make a wisdom saving throw he resists it you feel your mind begin to cool with subtle arcane influence and you shrug it off sword of sea eye give me sight beyond sight go ahead and make an intelligence check just a straight roll with your intelligence modifier ten you grab it and you focus and you focus and much like an element of the dreams you've had and the spells that you pull from whatever this agreement you've made with this entity may have been you can feel that thread connection from you to something beyond your hemisphere it's like that sensation of someone looking at you and you just know someone's looking at you and you turn to look and there's nobody's there it's like that all the time right now but you can't read more than that okay as we go to rest for the evening let's go ahead and make this our break so we'll come back here in just a few minutes to pick up the story for the next leg of your journey in the meantime guys enjoy these next few minutes enjoy the videos and chaos in between we'll see you here shortly [break] okay she goes to pick up your money at the stables you say on the docks how can i assure them that i'm allowed to do so if i did not check them in you forge it you have a forgery kit all right you guys go ahead and head off you gather the cart easy enough to do you gather your supplies they're all good to go you guys are heading towards the fungal fount kiri pipes up she says (as jester) get into trouble (as jester) get into trouble (cooing) (as caleb) you know okay turns to nott as you guys walk off (whispers) wrapped around his weenie (laughter) you guys make your way to the fungal fount the doorway is partially ajar it is open you guys make your way into the fungal fount and there you see waiting anxiously there's the sallow dwarf sitting in a small chair in the corner going ah so where is the heart did you bring it right okay so i've been working on something for you based on what you requested and i have these he puts these two vials on the table one of them is a healing potion larger than the basic kind the other is a sky blue color and as he sets it on the table as soon as it impacts there's a flash and you see some sparkles kind of going (energy crackling) through it before it settles and he goes i'm going to be honest not entirely certain the extent of what this is it protects you from something i know the basis of it is insulation i do not see what you mean he taps it again and (energy crackling) it looks like a spark i don't know but i bet it's interesting i will trade these and put a topper of 50 gold pieces you're totally pulling a grog all right if you don't mind-- he grabs the leather and carefully moves it off the table and puts it in a small chest closes it goes and counts out 50 gold pieces shoves it your way and goes thank you for your patronage depends on what you're looking for i have various balms and salves to help with headaches wounds that are festering some that help with helping your manhood come to light some that help you with sleeping if you're having insomnia-- essentially over about five minutes of him showing you around they're mostly general herbal remedies for day to day ailing elements it looks like all the special stuff that he had at his disposal went into those potions everything else has been general helping like melatonin things that help you a little bit all right that's five silver for ten doses there are some lavender oils i would recommend to you here it is i hope you like it it's quite nice he rubs some on his wrist yes for the oils and your sleeping i'll put it around-- i'll say seven silver pieces i can he gives you three silver back you guys finish up there okay you guys are heading off to the edge of the swamp with kiri (chirping) make an investigation check one of you with advantage if you're aiding the other sure all right what particularly are you looking for okay it takes you upwards of ten minutes not very long until you find one that's roughly that size it's not perfectly spherical it's got its imperfections but it's pretty smooth i'll say there's a very faint ring around it sure (as jester) go fuck yourself (laughter) (chirping) all righty make a sleight of hand check if you don't mind i'll give you advantage if you manage to succeed on a deception check well i have many possible uses i could extract all sorts of-- so just make a roll with a quick flourish you complete a fairly accurate recreation of the font utilized in its glorious papyrus without him noticing from behind the door with that you go and complete your conversation the rest of you meet up just as you hear the clomping of horse hooves all of you gather in the center of the puddles the clomping is this splashing as there's still two inches of water in this section of berleben (wet clomping) you guys take a moment to look through everything's intact kiri comes up (like caleb) she's probably a good egg (like nott) yeza was his name the halfling man from before (laughter) (like nott) shut up shut up kiri shut up (like nott) yeza (like nott) yeza was his name the halfling man from before all right you guys gather your things get back onto your cart and your horses and head southward exiting berleben leaving this swamp town behind hopefully for good making your way back onto the road which direction are you going you have a map you guys heading to hupperdook on the way those are high mountains the silberquel ridge is a very high series of mountains there are roads or there is cutting through the open fields and nature that's your choice to make looking at the map here you guys are heading this direction as far as you know shadycreek which is over here in the corner-- sam and make an insight check both of you as far as she's aware she's telling the truth you guys are making your way along the rillway road eastward from berleben heading from here along rillway heading past north of felderwin hitting the felderwin tillage and then there's a crossroads that leads to the northern gravelway path if you're following the roads if you guys are cutting away from the roads and going through the rough open fields that can be done via road it's about 110 miles to the crosswo-- crossroads and then 120 miles along the gravelway path it's about a week's worth of travel to get to hupperdook from where you are you'll find out when you get there you haven't traveled there before you may have been there actually the crossroads from what your experience is folks who are making long travels stop there and might set up shop for a day or two to sell or trade whatever wares they have before they continue on the rest of their journey and people from felderwin and the felderwin tillage head up there sometimes to set up shop if there are people that are traveling through kind of it's less a town it's maybe a handful of anywhere from four to 20 tents depending on what time of year it is it's a fantasy outlet oh my god guys okay she draws the best she can her drawings are rudimentary but functional you see two blackbird parents in somewhat geometric clothing basically best you can tell from what she writes down and communicates with you via the book they were traveling from the east heading west they are yeah you guys make your way out of labenda swamp heading southward across the bridge past the river that breaks from the ounterloch heading south because this is a longer journey i'm not going to drag us through every single stage of it but there are some elements that can happen during this journey yes exactly unfortunately given the lack of details lack of information-- the sending spell isn't able to connect with anybody unfortunately but you tried first day of travel comes to a close you reach the river actually you don't quite reach the river you almost do first night's rest happens for expediency who wants to make the perception check for the evening's rest both individually both of you guys roll that's better for the evening's rest-- taking your breaks keeping watch throughout the night-- no incident at one moment there is a shifting of movement in the distance fjord you go and check and there is a family of foxes that are making their way through the field southward away as it gets colder they're starting to move southward and you spook them off to get away from the traps the next morning you guys get yourselves back up into the cart and continue on further you pass beyond the river and start making your way towards the crossroads before your second day comes to completion who's going to keep watch the next evening all right make the roll guys keeping watch throughout the evening thankfully no issues happen you manage to keep watch evening goes without issue your rest is fine and you continue onto your third day of travel along the way you do finally reach the crossroads here as you come upon the area you see where the road diverges it continues in a southward curve and then a road that very starkly turns left and heads in a northeastern direction there are a series of wooden signs up and you do see three tents of varying sizes there is a blue and white striped tent a white tent and a faded green one a couple of carts are stopped off to the side and some folks are looking in there it looks like a very small merchant setup there but if you were to inquire you could see what's available frumpkin listens about and there are folks asking and trying to haggle prices you get the sense that one of them as frumpkin looks up has a small selection of fruits some looking more tropical probably further south-sourced brighter oranges and yellow in color some with vibrant green leaves the white tent goes by has more of a general goods feel there are tools repair kits for travel you see some bolts two crossbows in the back wall all sorts of general tools it looks to be a general store and some basic means to defend oneself when on the road make a perception check no books the green one appears to be mainly furs and leathers some that are tanning on the outside as well as bone jewelry made of teeth and bone of hunted animals if you start walking and glancing through no they're all various travelers no one has crossed your path before nobody of significance to your previous experience no you head to the green tent those who are going to the one that has the bone jewelry there is a human woman there dark weathered skin leather and fur over her shoulders she's currently talking with somebody and as you approach terribly sorry if you're looking for furs bones or leathers look around feel free to ask i will tell you what we are selling for that's unfortunate but we do she turns around and there's a few strips of leather that are rough on the edges but functional one of them has a fur inlay so it feels comfortable on the wrist i've made these myself these are leather the wristband that she has is leather yeah are you looking for bone in particular there is bone jewelry there's a bone choker that's a series of finger bones that are lined end to end that goes around the neck there's one that can go on the wrist looks like there's a necklace that has a bunch of various canine teeth-- not necessarily from a canine but sharp teeth from some sort of creature oh most of these were taken from various wolves dire in nature wolves these are from the zemni fields near icehaven is where i hail it's a very hunter-trapper community up there i bring the goods to sell this far south mainly meant only to sell but if you have something worth buying do present please i'm curious she takes it by the way the gator skin is not tanned it's not cured it is fucking nasty as you pull it out of your haversack it's dripping with congealed blood flies immediately start gathering and she's like ugh i can tell not interested sorry okay you didn't ask how much it was the bone bracelet runs you two gold it's not that expensive okay for the set of warm clothes which is heavy leathers and fur that you can throw over a leather cloak as well that you can bundle up in and it straps over and buckles multiple times across the way for you it runs past your legs almost so you'd have to trim it up a bit but that one will run you three gold pieces as you approach the white tent you see a female halfling there who is wearing a leather apron that has some tools tucked in there there's nobody currently at the station so as you approach she looks out to you she has frizzy brown hair with some gray ones that are starting to sprout from the outside that's pulled back and held in this giant poof of a ponytail she looks out toward you and points and goes oh hello looking to buy something oh great what are you looking for problems i have possibly some solutions that's a problem tents tents i can do two gold per tent we have five ready if you need four throwing those all together if you're buying a tent-- they're two-person tents each five two-person tents you're buying me out that's ten gold my friend passes them over they're all rolled up and ready to go as far as repair kits go these are a little pricier if you're looking specifically for cart repairs one kit i can sell to you for say 25 gold pieces that contains all that you'd require for any on-the-road going wheel repairs your axle equipment for keeping your horses attached to your cart raw canvas i can do but beyond that the rest of it's up to you 25 gold for that all right rolled canvas here i've got about 20 square feet of rolled canvas will that do will it do reasonable it's weather-resistant for the treated canvas if you're taking the whole bolt that's going to be five gold 30 gold and with the tents that puts it at 40 gold define 'little bit of lumber' for the structure i don't have much in the way of lumber i have a few-- there's no bamboo there are wood slats but no super-long pieces that could be curved over 40 gold make a persuasion check the days grow colder friend unfortunately i've got to make ends meet 40 gold fantastic thank you 40 total anything else you guys need what is fjord doing right now checking tinderbox what do you look like when-- no you do not anything else you guys wish to do or do you move on okay with your supplies gathered you load up back into your cart and now shifting over to where you see the signs the directions show nw - rillway road to berleben/labenda swamp ne - gravelway path to hupperdook/silberquel ridge and then s - rillway road to felderwin/alfield making the left turn onto that road heading northeast you begin to make your way towards the silberquel ridge kiri's sitting there on the edge eyes half-closed and her feathers all puffed up she looks over towards you (coos) (like jester) yes okay easy enough it costs you three silver to get the proper thick fur material to give her enough to keep warm eh beggars can't be choosers in this circumstance but you get something functional continuing northward as the sky gets subtly darker and darker preparing for what is the coming dusk you see ahead a caravan of carts heading southward along the road that's going to intersect with your path a caravan of four carts heading your direction heading southward and going to cross your path make a perception check okay glancing ahead there's still enough light for you to make out details they appear to be mostly human from what you can tell looking behind there looks to be a group of dwarf family members all gathered they appear to be families they don't they look like wagons and as they begin to approach they turn and give you a wide berth like they're about to make room to travel past you guys the gentleman at the front puts a hand up and the carts slow down a little bit nothing just passing through roads are clear so far make a perception check 17 there are men women children mostly human three of the carts one of them is a dwarf family they all look somewhat nervous general looking out quieting the kids we rode past didn't stop no no i'm sorry we must be going the horses pick up their pace a bit more the kids just kind of watch quietly as they begin to pass he looks back and says we're heading south we're just passing through heading south the kid kind of recoils from this blue-skinned horned tiefling all of a sudden engaging him from across the way the kid just kind of freezes in place okay there's a pause and the kid that you're aiming at goes like big smile on the face looks over and sees you and kind of no we're just getting away from our home nogvurot well this is where you're going and nogvurot is this way you can go straight or you can arc-- it'll take more time you can hit it on the way back it's up to you uh with the days of travel i'd have to go do the math again and i'm sure that the internet knows and has been keeping track-- i'll check in with critrolestats to make sure-- but since you've left just estimating right now i'd say it's been about a little over a week as of now you have a month all right you pass the caravan and they continue southward eventually it gets dark if you guys want to stop and make a rest for the evening you can so as you set off and set up camp who's keeping watch this evening all right and you do have new tents which is much more comfortable than the open air bundled up with your blanket in the cold night and as you travel further north you know it's going to get colder especially with the winter looming and the autumn coming to a close all right who's keeping watch travis and all right go ahead and make a roll guys or one of you with advantage your choice 15 okay not biome biodome all right the evening passes without issue actually keeping a watch-- well-- touche so you wake up the next morning you get the sense that being the vigilant beast that you are if anybody wanted to come close to inspect immediately saw yasha and went nope you continue on the next day of travel heading upward northeast further and further you can begin to see the edge of the silberquel ridge the mountain range that when you were approaching the labenda swamp began to rise and kind of loomed over the swamp and then began to slowly get more distant as you traveled southward the crossroads begins to come further into view again the mountain range moving closer more massive kind of peeking over this large-- it's very very steep edges to the base of this mountain range you get the sense that passage over or through is very specific or at least nowhere in visible sight as you guys begin to crest into dusk for this next fourth evening of travel who's keeping watch all right you guys go ahead and roll perception checks please 13 all right as you guys are just setting up caleb you're looking out past as everyone else is getting ready to bed for the night and you look over and you can see what looks like a shape off in the grass looks like a-- like a big mound but it's hard to tell from this distance but there's something in the grass all right so make a stealth check please still a natural one as you begin to slowly approach make a perception check please sure all right you hear nothing you glance around the corner and just beyond the grass you can see an overturned cart not yours another cart it's just on its side it looks like it has a cover over the top of it but it's not-- you saw the shape and the shape as you approach looks to be an overturned wagon roughly about 100 feet off the road walks over there make a perception check 13 nothing okay make a perception check 15 you see a brief-- a split-second of movement and you look and you see a crossbow bolt hit the edge of the cart-- near where he was standing who is still dancing not from this distance no as all of you come to consciousness you glance over and you can see the dark shape once caleb points out the direction where it was and as you're coming around the side nott because you did not roll a very good stealth-- you suffer six points of piercing damage as a crossbow bolt catches you in the thigh all right you glance over to the side and you can see what looks to be a humanoid shape that darts down into the grass and begins shifting around the other side of the cart yeah it ran down through the grass-- actually make a perception check just as you're trying to peer through the darkness here yeah you have no idea they vanished into the grass and moved what you assume to be around the cart all right the rest of you following all right you guys are all-- not carefully just straight-on run in that space you're still stealthing i'd like all of you guys to make a stealth check please as you try and carefully approach at the slow pace at which you are approaching at that many feet away-- nice natural one four okay fjord and molly lumbering across the field in the meantime two other figures jump up from aside the cart and both take crossbow shots at you that's going to be a 16 just hits and the other one is-- that's a 12 that doesn't hit so this one you're going to take four points of piercing damage okay they both kind of duck down behind using the cart to put a buffer between you and them you know where they are yes correct you guys are rushing in that direction you can see you see two figures dart up and then nott kind of like (grunt) nott is very visible in the field okay you invoke duplicity as jester's stealthing below through the field two jesters suddenly appear where once there was one all right molly and fjord you guys rush forward as the little globes of light all of a sudden light the area up a bit like it has a very faint lantern light in the vicinity okay fjord all right as you guys rush around yasha what are you doing okay you guys swing wide around at this point you see the figures five of them all pop up two of them in the field off to the side that you weren't paying attention dart up and the three from behind go ahead and the three are going to take shots at nott as well in the center that's 21 that's an 18 and 17 so that's six points of piercing damage six points of piercing damage and seven points of piercing damage nott's just being pummeled by bolts and as fjord and molly start rushing up a fifth one off to the side goes ahead and makes a shot towards molly that's going to be a 19 to hit you take seven points of piercing damage and the other one goes and aims towards molly and goes wait oh god stop stop stop stop your fighting you see the other dark figures look their heads swing over in that direction what are you guys doing okay the one that's closest to you is the one that shot molly he popped out of the grass as you were pulling around the side no the other one the one that's shouting is on the opposite end i'd say if you're looking at where the cart is there's two on the sides here that were in the grass and there's three that are directly behind the cart they're about 60 feet apart well you have to release it next round or the spell's lost okay you prepare you're readying slow there's very little light except for a little bit of light that's coming from the sky the globes are like a lantern light but it's the middle of the night so you can see the shapes they're not able to hide at the moment but you don't see any features or details as you're rushing up make a perception check they are aware you do notice that all of them have thick green cloth masks that cover the front of their faces bandit-style that cover most of the features go for it as you rush up go for it he just finished firing okay go for it the first attack you do because he turns and sees you at the last minute as you approach 16 hits all right stunning strike yeah it spends a ki to do it yeah he does not succeed he rolled a natural eight he's (groaning) kidney punch right to the side roll with advantage because he's stunned currently you (whack) and his eyes roll back the one guy stands up-- the guy who yelled out-- and goes we are so sorry we are so sorry we didn't know it was you folks our most sincere apologies the other guy is like what the fuck are you talking about he's like you don't understand these are the ones that-- these are the ones that ashed trevor the guys put up their hands oh shit we're so sorry they drop their crossbows we didn't mean nothing we're so sorry go for it it's leather armor it hits they're not very strong he goes oh come on we don't have much we're so sorry seriously this is a huge misunderstanding thank you thank you make a persuasion check aw no he pulls the mask down take the cart take it that's yours we'll just-- the other one's like what the fuck are you doing mate he's like trust me whatever's in it it's all yours right that we do guys gentlemen back away it belonged to someone they're alive we didn't kill them but we took their stuff and we sent them on their way no no okay make an investigation check make an investigation check first off glancing inside and looking through and rummaging and pulling most of the cart stuff is gone it has some simple grain bags and things that were placed deliberately to look like it had a lot and they shoved all of it towards the exits of the two sides of the cover but the interior of it is mostly empty you see two blankets that's about it obviously not very well right now look this is embarrassing enough as it is it's hard enough to make ends meet we're doing what we need to to survive we're happy to give you this we'll walk away and pretend this never happened what i don't understand he grabs the armor and tucks it in thank you right no yeah two of the guys go like yeah no she's got a point i know make a deception check with advantage he's nodding you can see the sweat on his brow and you can't help but notice the darkening spot in his nether regions of course no worries sir i promise no worries we'll go and we'll slop pigs we'll do what it takes anything but this right boys they're like the fuck you pissed yourself yeah they pick up their crossbows and tuck them under their arms good night safe travels good night the guy next to you as you're patting him down two things one you manage to get about seven silver from him that's all the money he has on him at the moment you find a hard spot on the side of his stomach that he should probably get checked out because he doesn't have anything else but she rolled a 20 investigation check i didn't know what else at this point there's a sound behind you a (huffing) you see kiri running with her knife going (like cali) i kill people there you go write that down in your equipment bandit pants there you go he starts to come to consciousness his friends have all run off northward he's drooling down himself you guys are about here yeah you're about 24 miles away from the crossroads you don't see them at the moment what's the range on that pantsless with a crossbow and a simple shortsword that's tucked off to his side his hair is filled with flowers he's on his side flopping away from the sky the cart's there if there's anything you need to grab from it there you go there's a couple blankets there's grain and it has a cover on it the cart is comparable probably a little more weathered than the one you guys have it's a basic canvas it's a tan it's a tan light brown yeah essentially ironic that you went looking to build that and it was already in the possible path all right so you guys pull that off take the blankets make your way back to your cart finish up your evening's rest and at morning light continue your way northward along the road all righty for the sake of brevity since we're getting towards the end of the evening-- the next two days go on without issue passing a few travelers heading southward crossing your way until eventually the silberquel ridge grows more and more prominent in your line of sight following the path the fields that surround the north road begin to give way to tall grass and trade for scrub land and rocks the once-vanishing shape of the silberquel ridge mountains growing bigger and bigger the numerous columns of mingling black-and-white smoke you can now see spill from the eastern side of the mountain diffusing as they rise as you travel even closer you can make out the two-tiered layout of a city built into the mountain one large region encircles the very base of the mountain ahundred or more dark workshops and towers billowing smoke from chimneys and stacks visible a number of large constructions dot the open spaces between these towers some oversized cannons or others like mobile siege towers one resembles a wheeled multi-tiered cart with numerous wicked-looking bolt-throwers attached as you begin to head in this direction you can also see that this lower area this industrial field of various engines of warfare that are in the process of being constructed some in their skeletal phase of being built to the base of the mountain above that you can see two winding switchback roads as well as one very steep staircase that ascends to a second level about a hundred or more feet above the first here you see a massive outcropping of leveled rock that holds the other half of the city there along the ridge of the mountain shelf lies hundreds of buildings and arches occasionally dappled with an autumn-colored tree behind this city mass you see a shimmering waterfall that cascades from out of the center of the mountain about 1000 feet up that glimmers like silver-white light and the little bit of sun that's coming through the clouds you've reached the outskirts of hupperdook from best you can tell from this perspective make a perception check it's hard to tell the buildings that are in the outside of the upper ridge look to be varying sizes they don't appear to be super tiny by any means you do see from this perspective as you're heading down to the base of the mountain you're at the top of the hill and this last leg as you start pushing in towards hupperdook at the base of where the waterfall is hitting behind that row you can see what look to be numerous towers thin and tall like these weird needles of buildings that kind of cluster around the base of the waterfall that's as much as you can make out at this distance the technology as you get closer and closer and begin seeing these fields of construction the industry is pretty prominent it's the most you've ever seen as far as the beauty of a living civilized town five or six maybe it's not podunk by any means yeah it's well-built it seems comfortable the base area around the mountain as you begin to approach-- and you can see now where the clouds and bits of steam are mingling and rising up mixing into the sky above you-- the colors here are fairly drab browns grays dark graphite metals and immediately you can see the ground itself you can see the ground itself as you step in the area has a faint layer of soot where some of the burned materials that are pressed up into the air have come down to settle onto the ground surrounding it what do you wish to do it's mid-afternoon following the path there is a large metallic archway that rises into a pointed entrance where as you enter you can see in the metal carved in various rivets hupper dook on the other side there you see two townsguards standing there both human standing guard and as you approach one of them steps forward welcome what is your business understood you would probably want to go ahead and head up the mountain for that down here is all industry he points out this is the iron lot and the assembly yard you're going to want to head up to the idleworks shelf to find lodging idleworks shelf yes the most prominent and most lively would probably be the blushing tankard tavern he steps back to his post and just keeps an eye as you guys enter in the midsection at this point you begin to hear the actual industry here there's this faint buzzing and clicking sound as you see some of these large wheels that are affixed to the outside of these large towers are grinding you can see platforms rising up with the gears turning and on them you can see numerous gnomes male and female in the process of what looks to be building materials lifted onto higher levels you could see some of these war machines that are being developed and designed here mid-construction you get the sense that with the call of war they're probably put into high gear in developing whatever siege weapons they can possibly muster in the short time frame and the furnaces are going well from what you can see from the distance you can see they have some larger-wheeled platforms that have bolt-throwers which are large-- imagine a crossbow but on a massive scale the giant metallic spear that gets flung from it at a really really powerful speed you see three or four affixed to a single platform you're not sure what animal would be able to pull that you also see siege towers 30 feet tall wheeled with a number of ladders and platforms inside that are used to clamor up against fortresses you see one that looks almost like a giant battering ram that is in the process of being constructed the interior metal rod is currently resting on the ground next to it and they're building an outer frame looking past on the far end-- on the northern end you can see a huge cannon maybe about 15 feet across and about three to four feet wide in the middle that one is on a platform the wheels are currently resting in the side and they're in the process of finishing the construction of the device make a perception check okay just beyond that on the northern side as you guys are riding past and you kind of get as much height as you can beyond these towers and what was referred to earlier as the assembly yard which is the area where all these war machines are being built you can see a roped section that is just pock-marked craters and scarred ground what you assume to be some sort of a testing ground for whatever they've been working on over the numerous decades or more they've been here you're not sure-- actually roll a history check because i'm curious to see how much you know about this i'll allow it this time but usually you have to decide that before you make the roll it's not a lucky feat so but going forward-- marisha and okay you haven't learned that much about the history of hupperdook you know it's been here for a while this city it's been here for quite some time so while you're not sure of how long that field has been there you get the sense that this isn't a recent testing ground it probably has been their general testing ground for any technology they're developing glancing about you see more crownsguard attire though now you're starting to get to more gnomish crownsguard who are established there and on their backs as opposed to spears or shields at the ready you see similar weapons to what some of the army moving eastward were carrying you see long metal rods affixed with a wooden buttress at the end these strange firearms that have been carefully relegated to certain individuals here are a little more in use here make a perception check not yet make a perception check purple horseshoes-- red balloons as you guys are clopping along you look down and most of the land here is fairly barren the outskirts of this whether it be just the heavy amount of smoke and soot that's put out by the industry there isn't a lot of grass what is here is pretty harsh scrubland you glance down though and one of the small bushes does have a very unique-looking white bud they haven't opened yet but they're beautiful amongst this stark ground and you could reach down if you wanted to you grab pluck a couple of them and put them in your book okay the ones you talked to earlier no you moved on from them but there are other crownsguard in the area you can hear the heavy sounds of metal clanging and the occasional sparks in the distance of some sort of welding process being done on some of the distant towers you can see on the opposite side of the southern side dozens and dozens of dark metallic warehouses and buildings that are junctured by hallways there are small compounds that are focused on whatever their specific businesses are in these designated delegated areas it's weirdly almost drab and dystopian in a visual perspective when you come to the base of the mountain here where you see that large very steep staircase you were looking at there are the switchback pathways up there but as you approach you hear this (thud) and looking up you can see these chains these big heavy dark chains that are shifting and as it does you can see this platform begin to lower from the city above heading in your direction in front of you at the base of the mountain you can see there are a few other individuals that are sitting there waiting patiently you can see this platform eventually comes down seems to be one of many means to make your way to the second part of the city it's a lift all right as you approach you see there are four crownsguard one dwarven three gnomish that are there waiting it you see the few figures that were waiting patiently they appear to be well-dressed human one half-elf wearing what looks to be reds and gold velvets they look to be relatively well-off standing definitely out of place in this rather dark space they step onto the lift and as you approach the guards put their hands out i'm sorry who are you lodgings well you'll have to take the path upward this is designated for guests of hupperdook guests of whom make a deception check i'm sorry i don't recognize the name you'll have to take the path i guarantee you sir i've never heard the name before in my life but there is always the path of course he takes a small pistol out from his side and aims it in the air and it fires with a puff of smoke and the chains begin to lift as you guys are frustratingly fuming over that not-quite-as-positive experience a voice from around behind you goes well now you look like you're not from around here is that true you turn and glance behind you and you can see through a surly grin and a curly mop of brownish-red hair a female gnome in her young adult years wearing simple clothes some leather gloves she has dangling around her neck a set of eye protectors she's rubbing a little bit of soot from her chin so you couldn't take the lift are you see that's going to get you far here honesty well probably both depending on the time of day so who are you if i might ask so you're not from around here i like that what brings you to hupperdook her brow furrows and a smile curls even wider across her face you're not wrong you're not wrong well i happen to be a local looking for a way to kick off some boredom mind me showing you around my name rissa pleasure to meet you mr-- fjord mayhaps we be getting in some trouble too we got about two hours well at this time it'll probably be about dusk there's a few inns to pick from i can take you around here i'll lead you up the walkway follow me you guys begin to make your way up the switchback path up the mountainside towards the upper edge of the shelf along that way your new friend rissa jumps up into the cart with you she says i get the sense you don't know much about us here oh no charge or buy me a round or five and we'll call it even okay that's all i ask maybe help me fuck with a friend or two she looks to beau and is like yeah anyway don't worry i know the place is a bit droll but once the sun's down it gets interesting anyway things are a bit busy around here they're busy most of the time general workday here is about ten to 12 hours no weekends no breaks like the rest of you lazy and lackadaisical folk fair enough give you a quick tour of the place should give us right about time to get some drinks as you make your way up the mountain making small chatter eventually you come to the outskirts of the idleworks shelf here encompassing the outer ring of this elevated shelf of the silberquel ridge is a lively district of taverns inns merchants open pavilions that are currently empty it looks like the place is pretty much perpetually decorated for some sort of an event or a festival but it's in disuse at the moment it is empty everyone you see in the street there's nobody taking a walk everyone is rushing from one place to another or shouting commands there's a general air of busyness and intent in each person you see as you guys leisurely stroll through every now and then you get this side-eye of-- and they continue on past a majority of the people here are gnomish probably 80 percent of the people you see in the immediate vicinity at any point in time are of gnomish heritage only offset by the occasional dwarf and some human half-elf that's as much as you've seen in your path here so far i mean you do as you do you are a very colorful ensemble whenever you enter any sort of new establishment not yet no but to be fair most of the streets are empty unless it's people going from business to business it's an interesting feel it's almost like the town is a ghost town where it's dead outside of those that are in the process of making errands or doing runs a little bit but not as bad as below at this point your friend rissa is pointing out in different directions and goes all right then that's over that way this is the center of hupperdook culture here on the shelf where most of the folks come to unwind beyond that you can see what's called the silver falls pointing over there that's the core of where most of the residents live sleep make their families amongst the small towers you can see and from this point you can now see those strange finger-like protrusions that were guarded around the waterfall are very condensed thin and tall metallic towers that have balconies and little windows they're three stories maybe four stories at most a lot of them look like they're off-kilter it looks not safe though they probably are it's a very unique living situation you haven't encountered with any other people in the empire and beyond glancing up you can see there are a few folks that are out there in the process of laying some rugs out and hanging them over the side one woman up there is throwing some seeds to some birds that float by and start eating off the edge there i'm sure there is not anything i've bothered with though not much of a reader my father well he might know but you don't want to talk to him just wait be patient be patient i choose to live on a low floor yeah gets warmer up top anyway don't want that you're telling me want my quads to be ready in case i need to go into a sprint run for my life you know i used to occasionally i supervise you're being a bit nosy here not going to lie i know we just met and i'm helping showing you around but-- i offered to tell you about the city not about myself i think you'll fit in quite well around here i haven't found a vocation that fits my personality tried some things wasn't my thing well there's a few different places are you looking for a quiet spot to sleep or are you looking for a wild place to not sleep blushing tankard it is at this point the oranges and reds of sundown have taken the sky and you hear this pop sound you look up and you can see splashes of light in the sky above you faint fireworks start going off you start hearing shouts voices echoing from the city from the towers from behind you along the shelf all these steam whistles start going off down below echoing from below the streets suddenly come to life as people begin to rush out of buildings taking off their aprons taking off their gloves setting off whatever their work attire is and rushing off to home to unwind there is a rush of energy and you begin to realize beau wasn't kidding they work hard and at night they play hard and that's where we're going to finish tonight's episode (cheering) oh fourth street i love fourth street we'll pick up this next week we may or may not have ashley depending on if skype is available nevertheless thank you guys so much yeah wil's been off-set trying to curse my dice apparently i deflected it to the party happy about that thank you guys for joining us tonight
