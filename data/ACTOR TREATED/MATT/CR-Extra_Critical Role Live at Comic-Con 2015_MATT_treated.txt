hello ladies and gentlemen thank you all for coming to our silly little critical role panel this afternoon how's everyone feeling this thursday afternoon (cheering) oh my god i love you too getting here was an adventure but we're here it's been a delightfully chaotic start to comic-con as i think we've all kind of experienced but let's go ahead and get this panel on the road work it forward first introduction here to our fantastic human gunslinger of the party taliesin jaffe as percy (cheering) currently rocking a clay sculpture that a fan made of the airboat in past episodes so that's awesome coming up next we have our sly charismatic and wink-inducing ranger vex played by laura bailey come on stage (cheering) i figured if someone would hit the couch it would probably be you so well done following that we have the twin brother to our fantastic ranger here the other dangerous stealthy half-elf rogue vax played by liam o'brien come on up buddy (cheering) hi guys i myself i am your humble dungeon master matthew mercer thank you very much for coming i guess i'll go ahead and i'll take a seat over here we'll share mics we've got a mic here we've got a mic there and orion's rocking the front stage there you go it's nap time for orion all right so i guess we'll begin with a-- what the heck (screaming and cheering) well i'm glad you could make it everybody this is ashley johnson our wonderful cleric pike (cheering) that's not becoming a t-shirt off- hey man roll some dice it'll be fun what could possibly happen i won't tell your parents take that sports no this is great orion you have disadvantage for the remainder of the panel yeah that's the story of how it all came together there are few things i enjoy more than having people converse with me and say like i'm interested in role-playing games but i don't know how they work or what they're about i hear it's a weird thing and i'm like well kind of but the best kind of weird knowing that once these people especially being geared towards performance arts and putting ourselves in a different place mentally for a lot of our job it'll be an easy transition for them to get into it watching them all suddenly click that moment of oh i can do anything yes well you can try anything that doesn't mean you'll do it but you can certainly try but yeah it's been an absolute wonderful joy watching this game grow and the community grow since we started the stream and yeah it's probably one of my favorite things period ever in my life so far the fact that we get to share it with you guys now is even more amazing and you guys have been incredible this entire journey so thank you for that guys sincerely (cheering) and on that note too the fanart the letters the recently penned critmas that has happened a few times it's a strange experience because for us just a humility standpoint it's like why are they buying us things they don't need to do that but it becomes this wonderful connection point where we get the opportunity through that to also realize how much it means to other people through these letters and these people that donate to our charity 826la by the way which is an amazing charity (cheering) we're having this strange tabletop renaissance now where you used to keep that stuff close to your chest you'd mention yeah i play dungeons and dragons you'd be kind of quiet about it now we can say it a little more proudly and as opposed to people saying yeah d&d that's nerd stuff they're like cool when do you play what you didn't see was me the whole time behind you going like-- (laughter) i can show you the velvet room if you like i'd forgotten about that well before we get to the q&a session is there anything else you guys wanted to talk about here particularly while we're on a baseball field talking about dungeons and dragons we have original generation we have the second generation release too we have the new generation which by the way the new red shirts you see with the critical role logo designed by taliesin jaffe over here percy designed those himself we wouldn't have judged and the other campaigns that are coming out of this all you guys who have already been playing or starting your own games and tweeting at us your adventures and your stories and your characters it's so awesome to see that continue to grow i don't know yeah tiberius's wisdom maybe not that far off (laughter) let's go ahead and move on to the q&a section of this we have a mic available i believe it's somewhere microphone-microphone-microphone audience mine's my professional name i use it for most things it's easy for me to hear when people say it because it's my name by the way how amazing was she in that your imagination exactly yeah in sylvan strongjaw yeah real fast i did want to give a shout-out to our wonderful gnome scanlan who is apparently watching from home and wants an ego stroke we have about 15 minutes left of the panel so we want to make this questions we have pretty quick answers to let's do whole game i know tiberius' want me to tell the story i know a lot of them yeah there was one sequence i'll make it quick they were fighting their first umber hulk they ever encountered in this nest that was in this cavern up at the top of a giant underground cave and there was an about 170-foot drop into a lake that had an island in the center and they were fighting it grog was trying to grab it and throw it through the hole that dropped into this giant cavern however it bull rushed him and knocked him off instead grog fell took enough damage to put him unconscious from full life and the umber hulk then was pushed out after him via tiberius and they all realized oh we're all up here with a hole with no creature grog's unconscious down there with an umber hulk he is going to die and so tiberius decides he's going to jump out after him and he leaps through the hole swan dive i'm talking gandalf versus the balrog style you know slow plummet in darkness i'm telling him you realize casting feather fall is going to take a really hard concentration check and if you fail you're probably going to die and he said yes do it he needed a 14 on a d20 and he rolled exactly a 14 cast feather fall landed and managed to stop the umber hulk in time to let the rest of the party come down via rope it was one of my favorite moments for his character (cheering) anyone else anyone else no that was beforehand a battle with a treachery demon by the way a glabrezu for those who are in the know i get to say that in a panel you have time for a few more so start getting these pretty rapid good good question next no go ahead audience i'm having a good time best cosplay i've seen here it was a couple years ago i saw a really amazing mass effect group that had an urdnot wrex that had a functional animatronic face it was incredible oh hi audience right the system helps our transition from pathfinder to fifth edition i did partially because of that pathfinder's a great system and i love it but the more players you have the more you can get bogged down with floating modifiers wait your bless spells gives me plus one to hit and damage and that gives me plus two to damage but i have a racial bonus against the kobolds plus six to hit four to damage three to damage it gets to that point being able to simplify the modifiers you can homerule certain things where you have a simple way of keeping track of those as a dm keeping combat going is just keeping your energy up you're the guide for everyone else and if you start getting slow or laggy everyone else will follow suit music also helps i find battle music really good sets we can't use any licensed stuff on the stream any more i had to gut my previous music selections good classic conan music works well lot of great fantasy films and good soundtracks work marisha and they know them all too well good music keeping your energy up and making sure that when it comes to players' turns they know what they're going to do if they're not ready you skip their turn you're hesitating skip it or put them at the bottom of the initiative order give them an incentive to be present in the moment and already to have their ideas ready to go things change in battle sometimes you'll get to your turn and everything's changed in the battle dynamic that's also how battle works you have to be like uh i'm going to do this and you're like all right keeping that energy up as the dm you're the holder of the flow of the story it's a lot of pressure on you but keep up that energy some good music make sure people are also putting energy into it because you put countless hours into that stuff the least they can do is respect that by being present and trying to keep up with you also hourglass helps i got a nice five minute and ten minute hourglass especially if you're in a skill challenge or an event that has more tension behind it just putting an hourglass on the table turning it over and being like you have this much time until what you don't know but what are you going to do you'll be surprised how quickly in the moment every player is nope you're twice the reason we still have grog he technically would have died twice that battle over yeah that was a crazy boss battle what were you going to say liam that was less of a boss battle and more of a scenario-based challenge you walked into the center of an illithid colony and freed them of their oppressor lessons were learned people we have time for one more really fast rapid-paced question we'll answer and cruise through it we have a minute left and then we have to run same time next year we're down we'd be happy to classic dwarven request
