--and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play dungeons & dragons and point to liam o'brien for the evening you motherfucker so for those of you who are tuning in for the first time welcome to the chaos we have a fun continuation of a very fun story line but before we get to that let's go ahead and get through our announcements for the evening first and foremost once again we thank last week's sponsor backblaze but today brings back loot crate once again sam why don't you tell us all about it thoughtful i still think stork patrol's the best andy samberg-related stork thing that's ever happened i feel like we should put a twitter poll up at some point about which of those three we all believe it might be yeah (laughs) next announcement-- marisha you want to talk about the new host-- tranquilized in a spielberg et walkie-talkie gun replacement world he was tranquilized awesome laura did you have an update in regards to the-- how do you want to do this we'll have further updates after tonight's episode on this just riding that wave of interest and tension well great do we have anything else we need to announce or is that the end of our-- i think we're good all right that being the case let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] who knew with captain damon who had previously taken you guys to vasselheim long ago you through the druidic mastery of keyleth tore through a storm that would have slowed your arrival seemingly forcing an earlier arrival than expected from the team at glintshore you guys went into full-on avengers mode and tore into their ship destroying it in the bay outside of glintshore swooped down onto the edge of the dark glass- and soot-covered beach and you now are all gathering the scenery around you as to what your next point in this aggressive maneuver is so at this point in time you've all gathered along the eastern beach of glintshore grog you are still an eagle a giant eagle polymorphed by scanlan you have your wings out still you guys have flown about and you've seen the remnants of some sort of small campsite with a faint ember still burning and giving off a hint of smoke but it's been a while since it's been utilized about five hours you just got there and checked it right now we'll get into the more specifics of that here in a moment so we have currently if i recall grog as an eagle scanlan and who else is in the center of the beach area between the actual shoreline and the jungle you guys had just gotten there yeah so we have in between the shoreline and the tree line the mostly dead petrified trees gray in the distance we have the two of you and the rest of you currently are now gathering at the beach at the campsite okay trinket (growls) looks around immediately looks down at a paw with a piece of glass sticking out of it so you see there are two small boats that are currently pulled up onto the shore just outside slightly north of this campsite there is a tousled blanket that is somewhat dirty with a small pack that was pushed in the side the leftover campfire and some sort of movement like something heavy had been pulled from the water into the campsite and somewhere else from within do you wish to continue to inspect the campsite make an investigation-- for this for you are you just inspecting for details or are you trying to track okay make a survival check to see if you can follow any tracks what are other people doing at the campsite okay make an investigation check okay what'd you get okay they're boats they're made of wood yeah there's two blankets that are folded in there yes your low roll investigation allowed you to completely miss that there was a pack on the side of the blankets you go to inspect it you check and see that there are a number of footfalls in this area clustered-- --sporadically it looks like some of them seem to be with haste some are dragging like heavy-- the heels are pushed in deep and you see a large heavy groove that was pulled to the campsite and has pulled further and further inland towards the treeline what are you guys doing right now (laughs) you're such a dick all right you guys take off over the treeline make a perception check both of you and you have advantage grog a one okay you swoop up over the tree line and do a couple of scans over the-- while the trees many of them are dead you do see there are a few peeking bits of green it looks like even in the midst of this barren landscape elements of nature have still managed to push through here and there little dappled peppering of green but the canopy itself is still too thick for you to make out any details from above that's as much as you can make out both it looks like a lot of it is burnt black but some of it also looks like the wood itself has been dead for so long that it's become a dull grey hardened exterior petri-fried okay there were at least three on the ship [no audio] a head shot by percy as it caught fire there was another that was crushed beneath your feet okay yeah you coast up and begin pushing through and down below you can see occasional breaks in the treeline here and there where you can-- there's heavy brush underneath and the same horrible texture of broken glass jutting out in haphazard patterns there are certain areas where the glass is aggressively broken and some more smooth glass it looks like it depends on at what point this event happened that turned this entire island and how much has been traversed in the time but you can't make out much more than that from your height approximately okay you go heading off in that direction okay you guys land at the treeline as you land laura percy and keyleth you guys-- there's this breeze that's been blowing through the beach since you've gotten here it's starting to pulse a little (wind sounds) and the wind's starting to pick up rather suddenly keyleth you are relatively sensitive to this knowing that the sky has been relatively clear with bits of cloud there's no particular reason as to why there should be a sudden gust of wind there is no weather that is indicative of that sort of-- yes 14 this is definitely not a natural wind and as you start to get that dark feeling at the back of your head you start noticing that some of the broken glass that is across the entirety of this beach being picked up by the wind swirling and congealing into a small whirlwind of broken glass and dust you watch as the wind begins to pick up into two other separate smaller shapes but that one central funnel continues to grow and grow like this angry waving tornado of broken-- make an intelligence check with advantage because it is possibly elemental-based two of the entities that are coming out of this wind from the sides are definitely air elemental by nature you're very familiar with this form of physicality you've taken on this form of physicality however whatever this large strange glass-shard-encompassed entity is it's elemental in nature but you're not sure what it is you've not encountered something of this form at least on this plane bigger i would like you to roll initiative not at the moment no percy has taken one of the boats and placed it as a guard keyleth stands here you guys are way off at the treeline oh god i killed percy there we go and vax you're off that side what you're seeing is this swirling torrent of broken glass with these two air elementals encroaching on the sides there and with that let's go ahead and roll some initiative folks we'll say as the wind's picking up you can begin to get up in the air yes how far are you going up whole 30 feet 20 feet all righty let's do it nope okay we'll say there you are on your broom so initiative rolls here all righty so 25 to 20 everyone right now even though you're not currently in the middle of the fray this is going to gauge how soon you can get to them you do so plus-- what's your dex so 22 all right 20 to 15 17 you got 19 scanlan vax 15 to ten swirling forward the giant maelstrom its speed rapid-fast this torrent of razor-sharp glass bits spirals forward and threatens to engulf both percy and vex yeah it moves around it unfortunately a [no audio] like this can swirl through the small spaces all right so we have that it's going to go ahead and attempt a whirlwind so i need both vex and percy to roll a strength saving throw okay so percy you go ahead and take ten points of piercing damage as the glass shards go splitting towards you jamming into your exposed skin you get underneath the boat and it just gives you enough cover to minimize the damage you however up above the wind picks up and swirls around you you're losing control of the broom you take 20 points of piercing damage in the center of this cyclone of death all right and you are flung 40 feet in a random direction that would be that way so you are flung this far away off the broom and prone and you fall and hit the ground i need you to go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw actually no because you didn't hit anything else you don't need to do that so this is going to be straight fall damage it's an additional ten points of bludgeoning damage as you hit the ground the wind almost knocked out of your chest still clutching the broom in your left hand yeah you're still holding onto it all right that ends its turn that brings us to percy beginning of your turn you are still in the whirlwind currently and its jagged form forces you to take 13 points of piercing damage just being in the maelstrom itself 13 points of piercing damage now it's your turn percy okay are you going to move or are you going to stay where you are it will give you disadvantage on each attack because you're doing ranged in melee which direction into the water okay you're still technically in melee it has a large reach with its [no audio] if you move five more feet you can you're now above [no audio] knees and waist so your movement is halved however as you pull out of its range a giant pseudopod of swirling [no audio] (whoosh) runs towards you and gets an attack of opportunity on you it rolled really bad that is a 14 you weave underneath the wind causes the water around you to splash and scatter in both directions but you avoid a giant blender of broken glass to the face what are you doing grog you're up next 23 to hit hits okay gotcha you fire and you watch as some of its form takes impact and some of the glass breaks it looks like it did sustain some sort of esoteric wound from the blast though not as much as you would hope from your weapon but it did take damage okay with the sharpshooter minus five hits 24 all righty this one still is a larger impact than the last one but it's still shooting in the middle of this swirling mass so it's not impacting it as much as you'd hoped 21 hits all right underneath the surface there it is murky and dark it's so close to the shoreline and with the black silt that washes in there you have no visibility underneath all right that brings us to grog you can't hold your movement unfortunately so you spend your movement and you can hold your action to do something if you want to okay giant eagle's speed so yeah you're a little over 100 feet away from them so the 80 feet as your movement speed with just your movement and holding your action if you wanted to you can coast up as fast as you can and at that apex of the end of your movement what action are you holding what's the trigger okay well then you can use your action to then move again like dash it and go right above it if you wanted to do that all right there's you with a scanlan unless you didn't want to be on him you want to stay behind if you want you can still be 100 feet back because i was thinking you were on his back still all right there it is so you're holding so that's your turn what are you doing scanlan 80 feet up all righty so with that-- that is 19 for its dexterity save what's your dc with your cone 21 so yeah it fails go ahead and roll damage on the lightning bolt it's right at the cusp of the water i would say that due to the proximity you might take a little bit because the conduit of the water around you because it's a lot of water it's going to dissipate pretty evenly 28 all right it blasts through the storm slamming causing glass dust to shoot up in this giant cloud around it and fall gently to the beach side you go ahead and take percy five points of lightning damage just being nearby in the water it impacted though not as strongly as you would have hoped it seems almost like the lightning is somewhat in the sphere of the element of whatever this creature is it took damage but it didn't take full damage (laughs) does that end your turn scanlan are you going to move or do anything he's the only one within earshot so yes all right go ahead and take your d10 inspiration die all righty ending scanlan's turn vax you're up you just took off when this happened or heard that so you'd be your full movement away from it which is 60 feet at this point haste has worn off so you're 60 feet away it would take you your full movement you can swoop back and get right in the fray you're going to dive-bomb through and chest-burster out the other side of this whirlwind okay hold divine smite until you hit you don't have to say you use it until you confirm hit that'll hit yeah that'll hit 38 points of damage as your wings out bullet-bird form vax you swoop down and punch straight through the back of this maelstrom you see its form briefly fluctuate and have a hard time holding itself together as you slam into the beach sand and glass right over next to trinket sending a cloud out in front of you that slowly comes down like a wave on the opposite side you stand there for a second look back over and trinket licks you up on the side of your face making a very cool moment maybe not as cool at the very end but still pretty cool overall cool do you want to do anything else you used your movement to get there you used an attack to go through okay this would be a throw because right now the angle you had to come through to punch through it you would have landed about 15 feet from it 24 so you land and then (whoosh) throw another dagger back at that 14 total nice so after you punch through you can see the burst through with this flash of vibrant radiant energy that sparks through its internal form a glow that's reminiscent of what you've seen from pike's spells before but with more of a grayer less yellow color to it throwing behind with that secondary dagger it plunges into the whirlwind and you see some sparks inside as it clashes with the different broken pieces of glass and eventually returns to your hand i believe that ends your turn now the two other elementals are going to go yep this one's going to flank up behind keyleth-- no these are actual air elementals there is some glass being pulled up in their form as they go but it's not quite the maelstrom in the center that's drawing everything into it that's going to be two slam attacks against you keyleth and two slam attacks against you vax against keyleth that is 21 and 19 yes that is 12 and the other is 12 rolled two fours in a row the elemental comes up and swings its giant whirlwind-like fists towards you you duck under one and then leap over the second one landing back on your place in the beach keyleth unfortunately looking at the focus of this and trying to ascertain the nature of what these creatures are and how you could possibly control or bend it-- 14 points of bludgeoning damage and 13 points of bludgeoning damage so 27 total all right that ends their turn now vex you're up you're ground into the sand right now dug a few inches into it from the impact of your shoulder and left a groove on the beach there's glass sticking into your shoulder and you're like ugh half your movement so you still have 15 more feet you can move big one do it 27 hits yeah a natural one just misses yeah 23 points of damage with one arrow that's really nice also don't forget that-- right four is lightning so actually that would be halved so that would be 21 points of damage also when you take the attack action-- no you already used your bonus action to do the hunter's mark never mind i was going to say having trinket next to it but i realized you used your bonus action to-- right okay cool sure you go ahead and grab the broom and you manage to go ahead and-- i'll say due to the nature of this no not quite you get 20 let's see this is the extent of your ascension right now there you go that ends your turn keyleth vax is here with trinket elemental elemental and the giant glass maelstrom yep like a circle almost so like a wind wall-- around a circle this way what shape do you want with the wind wall a circle like this out i see right okay so over top of them completely around you guys that's about the length right there i mean it'll hit all three of them yeah so you reach down concentrate slam your hand onto the ground and as you do the wind picks up out of the dust and the dirt and the glass and begins to cause another torrent of chaos around you this one controlled by you slamming into the other ones they have to make a strength saving throw what's your spell dc again 19 so this is a strength saving throw 18 fail for the maelstrom and fail and fail fail for all them so that's 3d8 bludgeoning damage correct so right now they are all currently locked in the wind wall right now it's 15 feet 15 feet high so how much is it total all right cool finishes your turn keyleth you staying where you are it'll still get an attack of opportunity as soon as you break from combat but you can still move away no not grappled they're fighting to keep themselves in place and together as the wind wall is tearing them apart the maelstrom cannot pass through the wall it is going to move away from it shifting over to where percy is currently underwater as you're hiding down this whirlpool begins to tear into it and all the water around you is jettisoned from all sides you're no longer submerged as you're lifted up this is an extremely forceful angry magical elemental tornado of death and hatred so yes it does get its whirlwind recharged but it's not going to use it it's going to slam attack you twice percy it has advantage on attack rolls against you because you are currently prone in the sand that's going to be 22 the second slam attack is going to be 31 the first attack is going to be 28 points of piercing damage right on top slamming you your face goes right into the muck with a sucking sound as you feel like someone's grinding a hundred blades into the back of your skull then it releases and comes down a second time for 22 points of piercing damage but you'll be there it is now your turn percival at the beginning of the turn as you're in its jagged form radius you take-- double ones seven points of piercing damage he starts his turn within the center of its form yeah even being in its form is terrible it's like one of those money grab booths except instead of money it's just lots and lots of pain it does can't pass through it correct yep you stand up using half your movement go for it and it is a magical sword all hit go ahead and roll damage okay how do you want to do this (cheering) from the inside okay you guys watch as suddenly the maelstrom begins to come to this uneasy torrent holding its form together you start seeing slashes and whirls of metal and flinging of blade-like action within the inside of its form before all of a sudden there's a burst of glass and dust that then rains to the ground as the water rushes into the space you see there standing damp cut all these small wounds across his face lines of blood dripping down the sides percy with the blade jammed into the beach one hand in the air as the water (splashing) up to his shoulders as he slowly stands up in place okay so that's as far as you could get because on land it's considered rough terrain or you can go full speed but you'll take damage for every five feet you move full speed glass it sucks all right that ends percy's turn grog you're up yes you can (caws) right next to him yes so holding your attacks until the form is lifted totally that ends your turn except for your held action what are you doing scanlan yeah it's your turn yes it does where is bigby's hand going before you continue that as soon as bigby's hand appears the eagle form vanishes and grog you come out with your axes in your hands angry not raging unfortunately but you do get your attacks you're angry you're just not raging so go ahead and take your two attacks that's fine but these are regular not rage attacks 15 the first one total that hits actually that just barely hits no two attacks hits so two hits on that 22 for the first hit correct all right awesome this is-- you're not adding your rage damage to this cool so that finishes your two strikes whack whack scanlan you have your bigby's hand up what are you going to do yeah right in its wind fucking face all right go ahead and roll an attack using your melee spell attack roll a d20 and add your spell attack bonus you can't hold a bonus action that was on your turn 20 just-- no 20 hits totally so yeah roll 4d8 force damage so between grog's attacks and the giant fist slamming into the side of the air elemental you can see it gets slammed to the dust causing this push and it begins to lift itself up causing this almost jack-o-lantern angry face to appear in this whirlwind but it's a having a hard time keeping its form together it begins to glance about for some form of escape scanlan do you want to move on your turn at all all right take your inspiration die 1d10 did your inspiration die go up last level or is it next one right but i'm trying to remember i think it's next level it goes up to a d12 yeah next level it becomes a d12 basically scanlan's turn's over vax you're up you can attack them both but you only can sneak attack once per round well let's go ahead and and look at that wind wall it won't have much of an impact on you you're fine just making sure forcing your hand through it 23 hits are you sneak attacking this one or the other one okay as you stab through the form dissipates upon impact as you throw your dagger it does catch the wind wall and gets flung out of the way oh you want to run this way okay you can move up to there that you can 23 does hit seven points of damage to it all right one is destroyed you rush forward and stab the other one it's hard to push through the wind wall to even get to its form you do manage to find purchase it takes some damage that ends your turn it is now its turn it moves into both of your spaces now we'll say up against the two of you there-- --and it's going to (whoosh) into a whirlwind yeah it can it's an air elemental the wind wall it can fly up and over it has 90 speed because the wind wall itself if i recall-- i'm going to check now before i do all these rolls it is 15 feet high it does (hissing wind) and swirls around in a whirlwind between the two of you i need both of you guys to make strength saving throws yeah keyleth and vax both of you guys succeed so you take half damage you both take six points of bludgeoning damage and you hold your ground it doesn't fling you about it's not strong enough it's wind its smaller form unable to push both of you entirely off your feet so well done that ends its turn vex you're up you can actually you fly up enough where you have a view over the wind wall and take two shots and as a bonus action trinket will rush up and bite it 26 hits second attack 14 so that was trinket's attack 14 points of damage from trinket pushing forward and (growling) growling and biting through the middle of it mouth full of glass it's not fun but it does some damage hits okay so two hits roll damage on that nice up above releasing two arrows you see a spark as they are released from the bow impacting into it you see trinket tear into its form every now and then you see an arm of vax swing through and keyleth's trying to push her way out of the elemental right now it's this mix of swirling dirt and wind but it's seemingly being worn down the speed in which it's swirling in its space is beginning to slow and images within its form are getting easier and easier to see that brings us back to the top percival it's about 35 feet from you okay both hit go ahead and roll damage 46 total these are all with sharpshooter right even halved from the impact you manage to blast the creature its form hitting the wind wall and scattering against it no longer physically able to hold its form there the elemental dissipating into the sky in the end as you all take a moment to catch your breath and look around everyone roll a perception check you guys take a moment and glance around it appears that whatever disturbed wind brought this sudden attack on has dissipated and the creatures you've slaughtered have brought this calm stillness to the beach all you can hear around you is the occasional (wave sound) of the water up on the shore it does not appear that there is any immediate danger on the beach they are sketches and designs one of which is of a more refined pepperbox okay you glance through there are other variations of retort the pistol that she had before you also see a few very complete sketches of a bad news rebuild not as good even looking at the design you can see a few faults in it that prevent it from being as powerful as what you've created nevertheless it is a fairly high-powered rifle-like weapon beneath them you see notes of five constructed and then it's erased two on hand it's like a ledger keeping tabs of each thing that she's created okay so (fluttering) as you say baby the voice has this baby this low tuning fork vibration hits the blade as you begin to go nuts on this ship you guys watch as splinters of wood go flying you put quite a number of pincushion-like blows to the exterior of the ship's bow neither of these will last much in the water you were about to when this happened make an investigation check yeah well this is investigation yeah then roll a perception check for trinket as you're looking about you see the tracks you also see in some of the grooves where this heavy object was being dragged you see one portion where it's dragged up or seems to have been dragged up onto a shelf like a very small six-inch shelf of glass you can see a scrape and some splinters of wood whatever was being dragged appears to be wooden and part of it was very very faintly damaged when it was dragged up onto the shelf so you know you're looking for something made of wood the wood slivers as you look at them they're a little swollen and damp whatever these were they were underwater for a period of time trinket goes (sniffing growling) and leans the head forward towards the jungle 2d4 plus six the ship is sunk you do not see anybody currently swimming in the water make a perception check 22 looking about you can see the bits of the reef that are slightly visible through the murky water surface here in the bay but the ship is gone you can see bits of floating broken wood from the impact of the ship it's probably going to end up as driftwood on the beach itself no sign of any survivors you do see two figures out towards it that are floating in the water face-down okay you're not going to be able to drag both of them with the wings one you could yeah basically yeah all right you grab one and it's hard you can barely get any lift especially since he's so soaked with the water it's an extra weight i will ask you to go ahead and make an athletics check you're barely able to keep from being dragged into the water it takes you a while to get there because he doesn't ever actually leave the water you're pulling him through it as you go it takes you about 15 minutes to get him into shore if you do yeah you're getting pretty close to the end of your time with those yes make an investigation check you guys watch as vax swings in with the wings dragging a waterlogged seemingly unconscious or dead body throws it onto the beach and begins rifling through the pockets 22 you find 145 gold pieces you find a spyglass and you find two small reddish-purple stones that are perfectly spherical in the pocket okay that's all you find fly up glance out make a perception check the dc will change based on what you're looking for you have a closer look of the canopy of this jungle you basically make out the same details that grog did earlier there are bits of green there are bits of live tree here and there but most of it's dark and dead you see from this distance there is occasionally a break in the jungle or a path that could be taken that isn't completely overgrown and too thick to walk through but that's all you can make out from this distance it looks almost like a polished red quartz imperfect you can see texture cracks or layers of a natural forming quartz-like material on the inside it's like a larger marble of stone make an arcana check these don't get used too often they're usually used more in emergency nautical circumstances or used as a means of gaining attention it's called a flare stone and essentially they're impacted hard and then thrown high and they turn into a flare trinket catches up to you trinket's running alongside you following the smell (sniffing) you guys watch is everyone-- okay all right you guys push forward reaching the treeline and then pushing into the jungle itself the smell of the saltwater air gives way to now the smell of ash and burnt forest but old very faint it's less of a recent burn and more an ever-present scent of dead brush you do catch the occasional sour smell of a tropical flower you do see bursts of ground brush and living plant life that has pushed through the glass and is slowly retaking the island over time yeah and you see it a few times it has a yellowish milky-white color to it and it has a vibrant purple stamen that protrudes from it it's almost a sour milk-type smell it's not very pleasant okay you continue pushing through the petrified forests you guys pick up and trinket picks up as well as you're pushing on for another 150 feet or so you start noticing broken branches you see little elements that you're used to in tracking movement from individuals you can see what are sheer signs of heavy footfalls occasionally another grinding along the ground it looks like whatever was being dragged has now been seemingly picked up or is now leaving less of an impact it has more people now working towards moving it that groove is subtly vanishing as it progresses but you do see signs of people pushing through the jungle at a rapid pace right now it's grog and trinket in the lead if you guys want to change up marching order for this let's do it make a strength check or an athletics check grog you make an acrobatics check you dart forward grinning as you just left him behind and all of a sudden you feel your hood go (choking) and choke you from behind as grog's holding it and pulls you back to him glass is cracking and breaking beneath his footfalls make an intelligence check it's hard to tell from the beach the only sign of any activity that hasn't been washed away by the elements was the campsite that you saw and that was relatively fresh you gather probably from the rather rapid rate of rainfall that storms through this area that a lot of any sign would be washed away over time however you guys flew over in the skyship and as you cased the island you did not see any pockets with villages you didn't see areas of the jungle that have been harvested for resources okay okay so you guys are keeping tabs on anything around you that might be a sign okay i will guess in this point one everyone roll a stealth check if you're stealthing forward glass rabbits all right the half-elves catch up on this as you're making your way towards this knotted section of the jungle this is the stealth check right yeah you guys are pushing forward you guys without a single touch of sound a little bit from scanlan but as the bulk you guys manage to stop him and as a group push forward you imagine fairly unseen pretty proud of vox machina grog especially being the one that stomped forward you continue to push forward everyone make a perception check the half-elves once again coming through with the skill checks you guys being quiet and being careful and methodical in pushing past brush without damaging anything vex keeping an eye on signs of movement and the more you push forward you start seeing some of the branches that are broken have less dust or general settling material on them you're coming upon something relatively recent yes there are bits of dried brush but there is still a very glass-based floor here there are sections of it that are smooth there are sections that are broken you can see the further in you get the less that it appears to be a jagged broken experience but it does vary depending you can navigate through carefully as you move it's pretty thick there's small breaks here and there but for the most part there aren't carved paths through the jungle here there's natural clearings and you guys have to find your way through sometimes it gets tight and you have to move around some of the larger trees but you're able to navigate without a huge issue it's not terribly choked off the half-elves as you guys are quietly pulling forward you pick up on what sounds like whispers hushed voices at least what do you do sure the arrows would be poison yes roll a new stealth check okay so you guys are all staying behind what's the marching order by the way you guys are currently in all right so vax is going ahead vax is going forward vex you are staying behind him are you going along with her are the two of you going forward or are you letting him go ahead back with the group or with him he's moving ahead of everyone else make a stealth for trinket by the way too because you forgot to do that roll a stealth for trinket because you've got to do that too well then trinket is popped into your necklace if you wanted to go with that probably safest so marching order is vex who's behind vex okay scanlan's holding up the rear grog behind vex and then keyleth and percy behind that and then scanlan vax as you stealth up ahead you-- the spell the level-one spell right the paladin ability all righty you stop and concentrate at the end of your turn all right you do not sense any celestials fiends or undead you scoot ahead and there is a small break you see that groove reappear in the center of this break and you see three figures on the other side of this seemingly in a conversation you see to the back holding a large wooden crate and is currently leaning against it and impatiently looking at the other two figures a female goliath with a heavy scratched scar across her face head shaved bald she has a shield slung over her back and a big sword currently sheathed over her shoulder she looks wounded a little bit there's a little bit of blood trickling down the face and then right in front of the crate you see a younger man with a dark hood up and cloak arguing with another woman wearing a very intricate cloak with a sparkling blue interior darker brown hair pulled into a very tight bun in the back with streaks of white in the back and familiar-looking weapons dangling from her belt you're too far away to hear anything but you do see them it's too hard to see from this distance looks humanoid okay you were about 100 feet from them you were on the outside of that slight open clearing and they were in the center of it it looked like there was momentum moving through and they have stopped to have this argument so you don't know how long until they're going to keep moving again okay minor illusion is very limited as a cantrip it lasts for a minute and it stays in that place where do you want to create it so you're releasing the dog you fly up into the tree there you guys all making your way towards the edge of this clearing the dog goes i'm terribly sorry what were you requesting hi this black mastiff quizzically turns his head to you yes what are we doing who are you what was the presence here great no maybe i'll see what i can do when who all right all right don't call me that please it's demeaning you already have his name i'll have to go look in my notes again anyway you know its name it's fine we won't go into too much-- you guys make your way towards this clearing preparing for the sequence we're going to take a bathroom break and come back for the ensuing chaos so we'll see you guys back here in a few minutes thank you loot crate check out the stuff we have awesome stuff with them back here in a few minutes guys welcome back last we left off vax noticed that apparently ripley and some of her crew are trying to make their way back further into the jungle and are in mid-discussion this is just for spatial awareness at the moment and depending on what happens possible battle where do you guys want to be for this this is the goliath right there holding the box i didn't have a box really but there's a big box that's ripley and that's the hooded figure all right what's up we'll say you're up here vex off to the side at this open bit here the rest of you guys tell me where you want to be placed anywhere that's green is essentially tree overbrush that's ripley that's the hooded figure a hooded thug and that's the goliath over here make a stealth check grog make a stealth check you're getting close that right there is going to be-- it's up to you a 14 keyleth where do you want to go stealth check scanlan you have a little dog with you 20 total okay so as you guys are setting up place vax you can start hearing and you start hearing some of the conversation you hear ripley loudly whispering look i've been carefully setting my scheduling on this and we have at least 15 to 20 minutes before they arrive the thug turns to her and says you also said they wouldn't be arriving to the island for another day or so we don't have time to drag our prize to the transport site anna returns immediately with a you are a fool to argue with your superior child i hired you as a bodyguard nothing more i plot you protect if this doesn't suit you allow me to fire you from service she pulls one of her guns out and cocks it and points it he goes no i mean no disrespect but we must begin setting a trap here now if we hope to stop them it's a he anna says you aren't wrong luska take the relic to the others at the mountain we'll wait here and prepare for our pursuers and the goliath reaches down and begins to grab the box and goes you mean use the relic against them anna says it may be too dangerous given we know little about it let me think as this is happening you hear a (cracking) in a nearby brush and all of a sudden they both look over in the direction as a goliath holding an axe is visible behind one of the trees (yelling) (laughs) okay so who's firing right now okay you you and you you're releasing a dog okay going around here for this you release the dog the dog begins to run i'll say it gets about there vax you're throwing a dagger roll for an attack no grog broke the surprise you still get the advantage on the first strike though okay 24 on ripley that hits roll damage okay you throw both daggers one goes into her shoulder and she pulls back the impact hitting but her seemingly resisting not taking the full brunt of the blow the second one hits again and it's a delayed reaction from the impact she's like stop stop now puts her hand out like that shouting out to you shouting out to the direction of where the dagger came from she sees you moving past in the brush glancing and is putting her hands up like that what are the rest of you guys doing are you going through you don't know all right vex bramble shot from up here okay she has pretty intense cover from you from that side that high up you can see where she is but she's pretty much almost full cover so she has a big bonus to ac first strike 22 with the cover bonus no arrow misses it hits a tree nearby (impact sound) hits another tree nothing she's still shouting stop let's talk scanlan and percy what are you guys doing you see her holding her shoulder from where the dagger impacted the other hooded figure has pulled a blade out and is looking around you shout all right grog what are you doing it snaps loudly okay keyleth what are you doing she begins backing away the spell has no effect she's holding the gun up her hand up now she put it up and begins taking a step back she stops moving the other figure is standing there looking what to do the goliath is holding the crate now the goliath shouts out here or bring it to you drops it to the ground and begins to back away from the crate about there anna who's standing there now looking over and seeing you where the voice is coming from-- faster than anticipated congratulations well now we stand in a curious position shall we talk you see the blood pooling down her shoulder the other humanoid male you can see now it's a man behind there holding the blade out to the side you're going to have to get lower to get a better look here you can get about there to get a better view the dog which has moved forward-- steps back there there you mean you can still see her through the brush you have a better view she only has half cover now from the trees you make another stealth check well you can make a bonus action to hide essentially okay both of you guys roll stealth you essentially both hide as your roguish talents let you 26 okay gotcha she says i have fairly procured a few artifacts for myself and you have done the same do we call it an honorable draw and go our own ways i have no interest in the petty tyranny of drakes and dragons every great beast that has asserted dominance through history has fallen to the ingenuity of man i worry not what you're after the other races percy and you know this in your heart they lack our dynamic ability to adapt to build upon failure so quickly that success becomes an inevitability i have faith you will all succeed in your mission so long as you keep your precious white-haired boy in the lead the man with the dagger out glares off at you in the distance make a perception check actually everybody right now the twins in come here guys anna continues arm up says religion is archaic and unnecessary the man stands there look percival as you're talking she cuts through your voice to him and says don't worry percy our toys have already made the rounds i sold a couple in vasselheim and a few more in ank'harel partially because i needed the money but also because he told me it would drive you mad we're looking at six and the instructions for creation to two other seemingly very curious and up-and-coming tinkerers like yourself okay go ahead and roll this combat has halted and now it's progressing again that's your attack roll your attack okay you fire and the dagger gets thrown the dagger passes through her form your bullet has no effect you watch as ripley smiles and lowers her head both her and the figure that were standing vanish from sight there's a streak of bright light from the distance as a small beam hits the center and detonates in a small fireball which then causes the ground to suddenly rumble and (explosion) erupt in an explosion of white light and force everybody but percival for a moment you are tossed with the blast of a hundred hammers across your body and face your vision is faded as you hear the sound of thunder but inches from your ear numbness takes over your form i need all of you to roll a dexterity saving throw it may you threw it over there it seemed to cause a smoky apparition but no effect he has advantage on dexterity saving throws the dog would yes how many hit points does the dog have even if the dog made it the onyx dog that reformed into a small object is now flung from a large fiery explosion dexterity save percy you actually-- no actually you should make it too from the sheer force everybody makes it okay so grog you manage to leap out of the way as you begin to see the fireball explosion that's just out of the range it hits in the center here and doesn't hit anybody but in a split second you watch as certain things in the ground catch flames and explode from underneath the ground itself erupts like something deep beneath the earth bursts outward grog you take 32 points of fire damage vax you manage to dodge out of the way behind a tree the tree of which is blown past you and you duck out of the way but it takes the brunt of the damage you take no damage with your evasion the rest of you take 65 points of fire damage the goliath probably took some damage too (chuckles) trinket also takes the damage by the way roll a reflex save yep grog is not blasted prone managed to catch himself 21 trinket takes 32 points of fire damage as the ringing subsides from the blast you all were thrown dozens of feet from your current placement most of you onto your back aside from you vax and you grog actually trinket would have caught himself as well you now see a giant crater in the ground with rock and rubble and shards of glass tossed around you the trees in the center have been blasted out and you can see a number of broken trunks and roots curved up with little bits of fire and flame burning off their edge what little bit of burnable material still remained on some of the living trees the smell of heavy gunpowder recently burned sits in the air as the giant cloud of smoke rises up in the center of the jungle at this point in time the goliath has stepped forward from the brush as well as two other figures off to the side wielding long-barreled rifle-like weapons there are a few other figures on this side as well and actually you don't see that one and ripley steps out of the bushes from the side over there the opposite side this is a heavy groove in the ground these are the only parts of the land that still stand at normal ground height the rest of this is a giant slope that goes into a crevasse and rises back up vegetation in that area is completely gone and there is broken rock and glass everywhere it's about 20 feet deep at its deepest everybody sees everybody right now i need you all to roll initiative (groaning) a number of initiative rolls on that one all right going from this here because this is going to be a bit of a complicated battle to keep track of for initiative i'm going to write it here 25 to 20 30 this would be the time to do it all right what'd you get grog 22 20 to 15 vex right 15 to ten ten to five six the hex is still around meaning you cast the spell and it's a concentration spell actually i need you to roll a concentration check on it oh you've got to roll a natural 20 that was a lot of damage buddy jesus christ taliesin somehow in the blast as your eyes flicker to and you immediately shoot up from the ground in a sitting position your eyes immediately focus on ripley appearing from across the way from across the crevasse and that little lingering scar of orthax in the back of your head maintains the anger of your hex you would have to designate it onto her next turn but you still maintain the spell top of the round is percy you are over here on your ass right now that's half your movement there you're right at the edge of where the ground breaks and falls in you're within 400 yeah yeah if you'd like to so you move the hex over to her with your bonus action she's now officially hexed dex disadvantage got it okay go for it that'll hit she has to make a strength save is it that is a 19 she makes it it doesn't knock her prone it hits her in the foot she almost falls over roll damage nice (gunshot) the blast hits the leg it almost knocks her onto the ground but she catches herself against the tree right behind her and pushes herself into place it is a tree about ten feet behind her 32 to hit that'll hit another strength check this one she does not make as she readies herself you fire a second time and it hits her foot you can see a spatter of blood off the side she falls and slams down on the ground taking three points of piercing damage landing onto the broken glass and the rubble around her actually because she's on the ground it's at disadvantage any ranged attacks against prone people it's not so much cover it's more the fact that they're a smaller target to hit because they're closer to the ground it's not cover that gives her the bonus right it affects cover it doesn't affect her being a smaller target in general to hit it's the way the rule works okay there you go it's a straight attack roll 14 does not hit it scoots past her and slams into the tree behind her you see the splintering of petrified bark around keyleth that ends your turn percy grog you're up regular rage or frenzied rage you can just get there you see him loading a rifle and all of a sudden you rush up to the side and he goes oh shit go for it 29 will definitely hit 33 points of damage oh i see they both hit go ahead and roll damage nice so 34 you actually did more second strike it's all right 29 as you rush up and hack into him with the blade angry your jaw clenched in anger the gunner is pushed back each blow gashing into his chest you can already see the crimson line of each slash across his armor folding away from the impact he's trying to get the hell away from you does that end your turn next up is anna ripley she stands up from her space angrily and goes that's all right we can finish the job she brings her hand up and begins casting a spell on herself she finishes casting the spell a weird outline begins a gold-like shimmer across the edges of her shoulders you're not quite sure what it means you watch as her right metallic hand detaches and hits the ground you watch as a flare of purplish-black energy begins to swirl off her shoulders and where the arm was now you see a giant shadow claw emerge you see a shadow begin to encompass around her another pair of shoulders and glowing yellow eyes over her form as she says i found a new friend recently seems he doesn't like being abandoned with that she vanishes this gunner here is going to aim at you vax while this one is going to attempt to step away from grog go ahead and make your attack of opportunity on him that hits nice as he runs away you hack again this time across the back of the shoulders he arcs in pain he's looking a little rough but still keeping up he stumbles away turns around whips the rifle behind and goes to fire at you with it it has advantage on you because you reckless attacked that's a natural 20 on the second roll with the rifle it's 2d10 42 points of piercing damage to you grog from the crit because you are raging and it's not magical that's halved so you take 21 points of damage going to reload the rifle and then go for another strike with advantage that's 17 plus ten so 27 next hit is 13 points of piercing damage reduced to six the other gunner aiming at you vax yes and it rolled a one and a 19 the first shot goes clear it hits your form but your form shimmers-- yeah it's going to the rifle immediately (gunfire) smoke starts pouring out it you see the metal is bent now and he chucks it to the side turns and pulls out a small pistol and is going to take two shots at you with disadvantage that's five plus ten 15 misses second shot misses turns the barrel goes to fire a third time with disadvantage six and a 19 nope the third one fires and each one's hitting your form but your image shifts around it no impact it's going to step back into the bush here try to get out of sight that guy's going to stay over there that ends their turn vex you're up you're over here flat on your ass looking up at the open space where a bunch of tree cover used to be that is now blown open the sky is visible these are some trees that survived the explosion that are singed and burned this is a trunk approximately this big underneath using half your movement to get up you would have 15 more feet so this is as far as you could get but you could use your bonus action to dash if you wanted to because you're second-level rogue you dash but you can't roll a hide as well unless you want to use your action to do that you can yeah so long as something's in range what's the range on your longbow it should be written down you should have written it down longbow is 150 feet and 600 feet yes pretty much everything except for maybe the farthest guy is questionably within your first range category yeah you do have a shot at most everything he might be it's hard to tell at this distance you'd have to gauge it go for it that hits 21 points of damage as the figure's disappearing backwards trying to get into the brush to hide the arrow hits the female warrior and you can see her move you can take your second attack on her that was the female gunner yeah right there 18 just barely hits didn't quite get into cover you hear the echo of angry gritted teeth from the pain of two arrow blows you're using the tree you're at half cover at the tree vax you're up the one that i whispered to was an illusion it vanished you don't see that figure anymore yeah right there you saw the two arrows are you going to move closer or are you leaping up onto the-- this tree's too thick you're going to have to get up onto the tree to do it you leap up and get onto it both hit unfortunately no sneak attack you're up next keyleth by the way great the two daggers pierce vanish in place come back to you yeah you leap just beneath and if you want to use your bonus action-- no you used your bonus action you're done that gives you three-quarters cover though from behind anywhere from that angle yeah he's behind percy now all right that comes to keyleth you have three you can get behind trinket grog after you see the guy back up and you start lurching forward you faintly hear out of the corner of your ear a rustle and your eye turns over just in time to see a hooded figure leap out with a blade in hand towards you from behind that is going to be with advantage against you 26 to hit doesn't help you in this yeah which he got advantage on the saving throw you feel something cold and painful sink into your back and your muscles tense up you take-- from the sneak attack-- 28 points of slashing damage halved to 14 through your back from the blade surprised that the impact didn't take as well as it did pulls the blade out looking at the blood curling on the edge of the blade you glance over your shoulder at this thug-like figure young man looking a little scared that brings us to the goliath sees you dashes forward takes no action pulls out a shield and a big old thick broadsword comes up yelling at you getting your attention full-on gladiatoral warrior-on-warrior combat shield at the ready ready to tussle with you scanlan you're up yeah it's a gradual crevasse that comes down and comes up to these points here with the ground that's been blown out yeah roughly both of these guys are about 25 30 feet from each other that one and the next one there they would be roughly 65 70 feet apart two dex saves the dc is 15 the robed one succeeds so takes half damage the gunner rolled a natural one roll that 8d6 damage percy you're almost up we have one more turn before you after this so be prepared 17 fire damage to that one and that gunner there (explosion) another fiery explosion you can see the streak from the wand of scanlan in the distance this tree begins to catch fire as it's one of the few not fully burned petrified trees it's going to curl up the robed figure ducks out of the way and manages to avoid some of the impact the figure that's already been stabbed and shot by arrows takes the full brunt of it and is looking charred burnt and barely holding on right now i'm letting it yeah you can take a potion as a bonus greater is 4d4 plus four uses a bonus action to misty step onto there robed figure-- yeah it's up at eye level stands there on the edge lifts the staff up the hand begins to glow in a shimmer of rainbows and as the hand comes down like this the rainbow blasts out in front of it with a sudden nearly-blinding show of magical arcane force did i get my templates because i'm going to need a template there ryan i don't see them in there it is within 60 feet you're using your action to counterspell go ahead and roll adding six plus two so plus eight to this it's a d20 add eight 12 i had an interesting thought here peerless skill you can add one of our own bardic inspirations to an ability check if you want to it is technically an ability check yeah it's an ability you got at level 14 you can roll the d10 and add that 16's not going to be enough only catches those two unfortunately wasn't quite as good as he was hoping actually it would get-- no trinket's barely misses i need a dexterity saving throw from percival and from scanlan 18 no you have the ability indomitable as a fighter to do that scanlan what'd you roll 24 dexterity saving throw nice well he gets 10d6 fire damage to you as one of the red rays strikes into you percy 15 points of fire damage to you percy would have been 30 that is really shitty rolls on that one wait percy you failed so you take full damage sorry so it is 31 points of fire damage i rolled an eight so that's two rays against you scanlan it is that's yellow against you and orange so that's 20d6 damage thankfully you made your save so it's half each lightning and acid however the acid you have resistance to 10d6 the acid you would take would be 47 reduced to 23 so you take 23 acid damage 38 points of lightning damage reduced to-- for the acid damage you took half of that as well how much did i say you took 23 that's reduced in half because of your resistance that brings it to 11 points of acid damage then you take 16 points of lightning damage you roll 1d8 when it's cast and on you i rolled an eight which means you get two rays thank god you had resistance and you made your save what happens yeah it's everything in a 60-foot cone was hoping he was a little closer that's a 7th that was his big one not with that crevasse unfortunately i will fight you truly i will fight you i have two guys fighting you percival you're up you can't right now no no okay go for it 27 to hit with the minus from sharpshooter 24 to hit yeah that hits make up your mind man wasn't an intentional roll reroll the bullet hits you see the robed figure the hood flies back you see a man in his 40s with a chinstrap beard he's still holding his staff keeping himself there 12 does not hit this time you go to fire and the mage now aware of your presence and what you're firing at him ducks out of the way and it shoots past 21 as a reaction the mage is going to throw up a shield spell seeing it coming towards him adding to his ac the bullet while it should have hit the torso ricochets off an arcane shield that shimmers briefly in place having no impact unfortunately 4d4 plus four yes all right that ends your turn percival grog you're up correct yes you'll have to move to push her yeah you shift around that way you'd get an attack of opportunity from the rogue and i would say so you're aware usually it's like when you go into a rage you choose to frenzy rage but i've always liked the idea of you going into a frenzy if you want to i don't think it takes an action to do so it's a bonus action to rage yeah you're fine you go into it all right so you'll move one over this way the rogue goes to strike you that is 21 that hits it is not sneak attack right now because he already used it until it comes back to his turn so you take ten points of piercing damage reduced to five as he swipes at you cuts barely across your back and you move into place okay now the goliath turns her shield up in front of you okay so the first strike make your athletics check i thinkthis would be your athletics versus hers yeah you push her back five feet there and you push into that space there first attack she puts the shield up and as you slam into the shield slides against you see all the glass building up behind her ankles and tumbling into the crevasse behind her all right go for it roll again that is a 13 as she stands there with her blade at the ready getting ready to arc down with the counterattack you slam into her shield and she (yells) falls backward tumbling into the crevasse down into the pile in the center she takes 15 points of damage from the impact and the shards of broken jagged glass that are at the bottom of it from the explosion before and she's like (groans) on the ground yes you can yeah yeah that'll hit 17 you rush up and slash across with the axe he puts up the rifle to try and keep it at bay you cut through the rifle cutting it in half and the blade impacts in the chest pushes and pulls the weapon out as you pull backward ready for another strike a big streak of blood pours out from the wound he's standing but looking extremely hurt all right that ends your turn yeah he has the ability to use his reaction to attack someone back immediately once per round yeah all right suddenly (whoosh) ripley reappears ten feet from where she was before and you can still see the smoke pouring off of her the presence very easy to see of orthax now bound to her the inspiration for her recent designs in carrying on the legacy that you chose to end and as she appears she goes and takes aim with her refined pepperbox across the way at you percy no you have half cover which is a plus five to your ac she rolled a 28 yes so the first one hits the second strike she's going to spend a grit point to violent shot that is a 26 okay and a third strike she's going to headshot you that's all right that was a natural one it misfires the first two shots hit but the third one misfires so with her refined pepperbox she takes aim (gunfire) takes a shot actually before she does that she bonus actions towards you and you feel a similar feeling take over you as you now percy liam and so the first shot with this is going to be 12 points of piercing damage from the first strike plus two psychic as the impact hits you and you feel this shocking ring in your head you see a flash suddenly in your mind of the dark-shadowed face of orthax laughing yes second shot which is a violent shot on hit has double dice value so that's 18 points of piercing damage okay plus four psychic go for it okay you catch the bullet and for the most part it still pierces through plus four psychic so eight total the third gun shit and you watch as she goes very well and vanishes again from sight that brings us to the gunner's turn this one here is going to go ahead and it's horribly wounded this one the rifle misfired if i recall yes and has pulled out a pistol so the gunner here using a pistol is going to take three shots at you vax with disadvantage on them correct well two shots one and then a reload and then one so the first shot with disadvantage that's a 27 and 24 all right so the disadvantage has faded but still you take from the first hit 12 points of piercing damage and the second strike without disadvantage is terrible that is a 13 rolled a three but it did not roll enough to misfire so reload last shot fire misses it's going to run this way yeah you can do that so half damage all righty the other one who's in front of you grog and is scared out of his mind is going to attempt to step back so go ahead and take your-- he does not want to be in your face that hits roll damage yeah no it's too late 16 you arc back this time you jam it into the leg and you see him now limping one eye is like half closed and swollen breathing heavy one arm is busted and is still holding the pistol up and points it toward you he's going to take three shots with the pistol that's already loaded now that he got rid of the big gun the first one is going to be (shouting) 12 you dodge to the side next shot is 25 this one will be eight points of piercing damage and this one it's going to use all three grit points that it has to do a triple violent shot it adds more to the misfire score but it can add to a lot of damage 22 26 points of piercing damage reduced to half to 13 yeah goes firing at you with the shots and as you're still standing and taking it all he's shaking and backing up all right that ends the gunner's turn vex you're up all right still visible over here yeah go for it that'll hit oh and percy i forgot to add nine additional points of necrotic damage from the hex i forgot to add that to the damage you were taking i give it to you all the time all right (grunts) 23 hits 17 points the other arrow snaps into her leg as she's trying to run past (grunts) she almost stumbles for a second and has to-- okay go for it vax you're up over there to the crevasse or around it 25 30 slide down moving at this speed you're taking damage for each one so you take six points of piercing damage or one point of damage for each square that you run past in the glass no one point per square i kept forgetting the glass aspect of this that's as close as you can get you took a total of 18 points piercing damage it's going to have to be a climb check to get up next round that's as far as you can get you're running through the crevasse as you go okay there you go all right for this one as you're ducking through you're shouting it out but you don't even know if he's really paying attention at the moment all right ending your turn keyleth you're up (chuckles) all righty all right so it's a ten-foot radius so a ten-foot radius i'm going to kill all of you a 30-foot high cylinder so you're creating it here all right so you guys watch as the wind kicks up-- you could technically yeah if you want to all right so you watch as a cloud begins to appear above and shoots down in an instantaneous funnel a tornado slams down into this crevasse as keyleth's eyes glow her reaching out and drawing it to the ground all right it sucks up any medium or smaller objects that aren't secured creatures make a dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or the whirlwind enters its space so they both have to make a dex save the mage that's an eight that's a nope the goliath that's a 19 and 18 plus one what's your dc it succeeds the goliath does the mage does not 10d6 bludgeoning damage if you could 10d6 21 plus 36 bludgeoning damage the goliath grapples on to some of the shards of broken glass and while taking the bludgeoning impact manages to stay in place the mage has to make a strength saving throw or become restrained in the spell until it ends and rolls a two he is restrained restrained means speed becomes zero attack rolls against him have advantage and it has disadvantage on dexterity saving throws he can try to use his action to break free and then it is hurled from it but right now it is currently held when it starts his turn he begins being pulled up in the air inside the whirlwind it's pretty cool all right cool and you can use your move to move the whirlwind 30 feet so now that's he's restrained in it if you move the whirlwind elsewhere he goes with it you know you didn't use your movement you can move up to 30 feet and possibly pick up other things if you want to no one is directly nearby but you can start moving it in a certain direction if you'd like okay so leaving behind 25 30 that's where you're going to want to leave it there currently held up inside that that sucks for you keyleth that end your turn keyleth as you're casting the spell and holding aloft the hooded thug the younger man runs behind and flings a dagger in your direction yeah you do have half cover on that which adds three-quarters cover is plus five it may be plus two for half cover let me double-check i'll say it's three-quarters cover that's fine you get plus five to your ac 24 what's your ac yeah that hits still yeah it still hits you okay so flings the dagger this black curved razor-like dagger sinks into you currently no sneak attack damage but you do take-- 16 points of piercing damage to you i need you to make a concentration check just roll a constitution saving throw it would be ten or higher don't roll low constitution saving throw you make it you maintain concentration however as the blade hits you you watch as it was thrown you notice kynan shifts into shadow and goes after the blade vanishing the blade strikes you and then suddenly kynan's hand appears where the blade stabbed you and he appears next to you up on the log right there you see him shaken there's sweat on the face that ends his turn it is now the barbarian not the barbarian the goliath's turn there is going to attempt to make an athletics check to climb that's enough gets up just barely to the top and that's not going to be enough to really do much else on her turn unfortunately messed up everything she's been trying to do yeah shield climbs up wipes off the blood from the side of her mouth (growls) scanlan you're up yes it is oh shit all right hold on reverse gravity 100 feet you could totally get it over there 50-foot radius so yeah it's going to get-- you can get everyone in that including grog grog make a dexterity saving throw with advantage because it's against a spell nope the gunner fails the goliath fails interestingly enough the mage is unaffected because he's not affected by gravity he's currently being held in a whirlwind however go ahead and at the full 100 feet high everyone hits the very top of it and then you can choose to then either maintain it or drop them immediately there's a gunner there and then there's the goliath warrior they are all currently now (screams) unable to attack unable to really do anything well up from there yeah he's over there and there's the gunner over there 50-foot radius yeah that would have put-- i'll make a dex save on them that is a 21 what is your dc so just makes it so it's barely holding on right now reaches over and grabs part of the tree and is like (groaning) seemingly yeah currently he's holding on to the branch preventing himself from falling upward grabbing a root and part of a tree and is like (yelling) stuck there in the moment do you want to move through it or around it's up to you this way five points of piercing damage to you scanlan as you're running across grog's taken none because grog's rage essentially halves the one point you take per walk so you don't take any damage everyone else has been barely moving so they've been doing the half move you take one point of damage per square you move what level are you casting it as 2nd-level okay so 2d4 plus six 12 points healed to you vex all right the mage who is currently held in the whirlwind-- let's see here he's just restrained he can still do things while it's in the whirlwind it can't move attacks against it have advantage-- apologies for the delay okay that works so the mage who's currently held aloft and floating about looks over at the source of the whirlwind puts a hand out and goes (grunt) you watch as an arc of lightning arcs over in the direction of keyleth it arcs past-- no the throw is when he breaks free of it right now he takes damage where is it basically it just does the damage and then it holds him in place you can basically control where they are which is the fun of it it's restrained and it's held within just making sure i'm not missing any of the elements here first time in a turn that it enters the whirlwind or the whirlwind enters its space including when the whirlwind first appears so yeah it doesn't keep taking damage it is being held aloft right now and you can move it over other guys as you continue to press through more damage so anyway the arc of lightning arcs over 150-feet distance hitting towards you i need you to make a dexterity saving throw keyleth no it doesn't help you this is true so go ahead and dexterity saving throw does not help unfortunately it's 10d8 lightning damage we'll find out in a second so keyleth you take 59 points of lightning damage 59 points of lightning damage from the chain lightning spell that just hit you you fall unconscious the whirlwind vanishes (thump) and the mage falls prone-- cannot grab onto anything because he was actually lifted up in the air so the mage is now 100 feet in the air however three bolts then leap from the target to as many as three other targets so that's going to be-- goes to the first-- that includes scanlan so scanlan percy and trinket all get a bolt he chooses the targets so i need percy scanlan and trinket to make a dexterity saving throw not unless you already have inspiration let me see here make sure if it's an ability check only for an ability check for you unfortunately scanlan and trinket so you took how much damage from that 59 59 points of lightning damage to you scanlan goes unconscious on the ground percy you take 38 points of-- it would be-- no sorry half of 59 28 29 29 points of lightning damage to you percy and trinket takes 59 points of lightning damage yeah (whoosh) so trinket turns into a little burst of dark bear shadow and (whoosh) shoots into your necklace and everyone falls (laughs) that is 30 points of bludgeoning damage yeah you take half because you can still maintain your rage while up there so you take 15 exactly the gunner splats just a messy splat of red crimson on the ground impacts is alive but hurt and is like (pain grunt) on the ground yes and then takes an additional-- actually let's see if she manages to make a saving throw to stay there she actually lands on the edge because that's where she was standing before nope not with a five so that's an additional 13 points of damage oh she's looking rough but that other gunner is gone that guy's fine who's been holding on the mage takes-- the mage splats grog you are prone on the ground there percival it's your turn go for it yeah go ahead and roll for an attack no roll a d20 you add your proficiency bonus of five plus your strength modifier i know you know what for the hmm-- i would say unfortunately because you're not a monk it's going to be strength it's for every physical impact you hit what'd you roll yeah you're fine yeah but you do actually strike so he's going to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw natural one although i love when the dice make narrative work so go ahead and roll with a lightning charge earlier any additional charge so 3d6 ten points all righty ten points of damage to kynan and kynan is stunned for the round i also need you to roll another d20 just roll another d20 11 okay diplomacy shorts out and is probably going to need to be repaired he's like (grunt) the electricity hit he's currently shocked he's going to be stunned-- he can't do anything for the next round yes you are to feed somebody a potion that's a full action yourself is a bonus but that requires you to pull it out grab someone open their mouth pull off the cork pour it down and make sure they swallow it go for it go for it oh yeah no he is stunned so attacks have advantage technically it's incapacitated-- well they're both crits yeah because they're melee double dice then add bonus 34 on the first strike total okay 34 points of damage as you (swish) and start carving up the currently paralyzed man the armor separating with each slash the red crimson beginning to pour from the wounds the eyes are quivering in fear okay ends percy's turn grog you're up yep you still have 25 feet of movement if you want it that's the goliath that is vax'ildan you can if you slide down to meet her with that kind of force you will take seven points of piercing damage reduced to three so that's three points of piercing damage you (sliding noise) down to the bottom she is prone yes you do you may 28 sure regular is 1d4 plus-- no 2d4 plus two sorry so grog yep you slam that axe down once into her chest she (pained yell) gives out air and grabs the blade to try and pull it out from the wound you put your boot down on her face and push her away pull the axe up how do you want to finish her off how do you want to do this (slash sound) it's purplish and gray given the force of the impact and the scattering of the top of the head against the stone and glass yeah she is no more the body goes limp and as you realize your foot on her pushing her down you're actually pushing the glass shards through her body that are underneath her and you see them begin to pierce through her armor plating (slash) there you go slid down there i could give you an athletics check to try and climb out but you will just barely get out you won't get your full movement with advantage because you're raging you rage-climb to the edge end of your turn all righty reverse gravity fucked up everything a little ripley appears at the edge of the crevasse she glances about and sees the state of her party and goes (groans) and then peers off in your direction all right she is going to go ahead and-- well she can take a bonus action to go ahead and attempt to repair it well no for this this would be-- --an action to do it yeah that's true that's a success so she repairs it with her action an action surge oh no it's on the list don't worry the first strike she has two more grit points she's going to spend one to do a violent shot on you that is a 25 25 25 yeah it wasn't a very high roll all right so that's a violent shot on that she's going to spend another grit point to do-- well let's do that attack first so that is 2d10 (counting) 25 points 25 points of piercing damage with two points psychic how often can you snare ranged stuff no but i'm trying to see how many times you can use that every turn as a reaction that's pretty cool all right go for it just want to make sure so it was 25 plus two 27 so 19 plus two points of necrotic damage from hex what are you at for this you are unconscious let me see this real fast you'll see if it has a perk no that does not affect you at this time okay so are you unconscious you hit the ground as you fall the shadow around ripley flares and you hear a voice go yes she aims and takes another shot at you yeah that hits you lose a death saving throw third shot at you second death saving throw she shouts over her shoulder finish him and she doesn't vanish there's a shimmer and she goes ugh curses and runs (counting) 30 that way actually not quite right there she shouts over her shoulder finish him this one over here looking over to the side goes and takes aim yeah the gunners go next correct and technically it is-- this is with the pistol (gunshot) takes a shot the third bullet (rushing bullet) sinks into percy's form and the breath fades to stillness the necklace (breaking glass) shatters around your neck the one that pike gave you and a sudden burst of divine energy fills your body and you're restored to one hit point (gasping and exclaiming) she pulled it from under her bed and yeah that's going to go ahead and end the gunner's turn vex you're up scanlan goes far after you no because it has to be-- as you get two attacks it's either you attack or you do something else so no you do take-- that is your movement to get there and back you aren't taking slow steps that's going to be six points of piercing damage running across the glass all right end of your turn vax you're up on ripley let's do it she is hunter marked i need you to make an athletics check you can't get out of the crevasse you try climbing and the rock's breaking away make another attempt you get almost to the edge and the glass breaks you slide back down into the crevasse you climb up to the edge (panting) that's your turn but you're out of the crater make a persuasion check 19 okay that ends vax's turn keyleth i need you to make a death saving throw 11 okay all right it is now kynan's turn kynan is stunned the stun wears off at the end but kynan is left there breathing heavy looking down at the two bleeding bodies before him one that is eyes flash open on the ground and keyleth currently face down in the dirt with a little puddle of blood around the corner of her mouth at the end of kynan's turn scanlan you are conscious but you are prone on the ground right now that's half your movement you can move that far and you take two points of piercing damage okay that's a bonus action so that's 2d4 plus six all right you come to consciousness okay what's the range of the fireball yes that'll do she with a roll of a natural 17 plus disadvantage on the dex oh no because you were unconscious the hex is gone you probably would have lost concentration anyway but it's fine okay 10d6 all right so yeah she makes her save on that the gunner does not the gunner does not survive this no matter what you roll the gunner is a crispy pile of ash thrown toward the back of-- go ahead and roll 10d6 damage 27 halved to 13 the cloak flashes a bright blue underneath and it seems almost like some of the fire pulls into the cloak it begins to glow with this pulsing charge she takes even less damage than you expected she takes some damage you can now see this crackle across the cloak all right that's your turn as the lightning's crackling around her she goes well sometimes you have to rely on those that prove worthy the shadow that's around her shoulders leaps off you watch as orthax now appears next to her the shadow is still connecting them you watch as this long stretch of shadow curls across and attaches to her leg they're still bound by this tether of darkness but nevertheless they are both together on the field let's see orthax is going to go ahead and (whooshing) there and is going to go ahead and look toward you and go you will be my quarry now big man you are currently hit with the mark of vengeance nope you are just marked the form is in a bad place right now he's there out of desperation but there is sunlight coming down from the sky and you can see it's hurting its presence but once again in a desperate place all right up to the top percy okay 29 hits 15 does not you see the flash of smoke off her shoulder at the impact you see her hair that's pulled up has now fallen in her face now covering part of her in the front where a little bit of blood curls at the corner of her mouth that ends your turn grog you're up you would have to use an action to dash well no it's an action to do two attacks so you may-- let me double check really fast here as part of your frenzy-- yeah which means you get one attack you would move you would use your action to move again and you would have your bonus action to do one hit you'll take an attack of opportunity if you do so (counting) yeah you'd get up right into her face her eyes go wide as you approach orthax does get an attack of opportunity against you he has advantage on attacks against a marked creature that's a 23 to hit all right you take (counting) 18 points-- no i'm sorry he had advantage on the roll so that would be 24 points of psychic damage as the claw rakes through your body missing your corporeal form it shocks into your system your brain spiking with pain it's your reaction to do it so you could run past and (whack) you run you get raked you spin with the axe and attempt to slam into it using the momentum to keep charging forward 26 will hit roll damage 27 okay you do yeah the mark gives him advantage on attacks but the sunlight is giving him disadvantage so he just gets a single regular roll against you anyone else he's going to have a harder time but the mark is helping him you get right up to ripley gun still in hand seeing you rush up angrily with your one angry raging goliath freight train of an individual what do you want to do 28 that hits a little bit of blood spatters across the ground near her she takes the wound and shrinks away a bit clutching her chest nice that end your turn it's now her turn first she's going to use her bonus action to use her second wind she is not attacking you in melee seeing you in her face she's like you're next leans over and is going to fire at you percy yeah she's in melee well no actually you used your reaction to hit orthax so she can move away from you without getting an attack of opportunity she does take six points of damage from the run but that gives her a better angle on you she's going to use her-- no she has one more grit point no i think you're right she did she has one more attack 21 with the cover yeah right natural 20 which gives her a grit point back 17 points of piercing damage and four points of psychic damage the psychic damage is a thing you don't know it's 17 points of piercing damage plus four points psychic third and final shot nope that is a 26 to hit you take 11 points of piercing damage plus four psychic (zap) all right she vanished vex you're up she did move her full movement yeah okay go for it roll for two attacks first attack 19 seems to pass through what are you going to do okay go for it the arrow goes high over the tree line and disappears in the distant jungle you get up to the top of your tree right here up above the tree looking down into this open area that ends your turn vax you're up kynan's over here on top of the tree he just got out of being stunned at being shocked with diplomacy persuasion roll all right good to know that ends your turn keyleth you're in daylight adding daylight isn't going to make a huge difference in daylight yeah and he's currently in sunlight no there's no tree cover all the trees got blown out of this area from the explosion so adding daylight would just make daylight in daylight you don't know you haven't messed with it and right now you see the tether reaches out and then dissipates fades it's still facing this direction it's just faded all right end of your turn keyleth all right kynan steps off the back of the log out of sight there's a small gap beneath the log where kynan comes out from underneath as you finish the healing spell and takes the blade and jams it right into your back tries to at least that is 23 (adding) 26 points of damage he jumped over the top hid and then came underneath and got her as soon as he sees you fall he pulls the blade out and drops it to the ground and goes i'm sorry and falls to his knees and starts shaking in place that's going to end his turn scanlan you're up take five points of piercing damage running across the glass you start waving your hands freely as you swing it around and you're moving around nothing now orthax is going to dimension door and then would move over there yeah no because he can jump through shadow he's going to use his rampage pulse so i need vax percy keyleth and kynan to all make a wisdom saving throw (groaning) all right percy you take ten points of psychic damage still conscious though right vax you also take ten points of psychic damage kynan actually does make his save strangely really high roll however percy as you feel the rampage pulse hit you your eyes go red and suddenly you're surrounded by shadow entirely you pull the gun over and you fire at something that's nearby i need you to make a single pistol attack with disadvantage against keyleth strikes the wood and splinters off vax i need you to make a dagger attack against percy what did you roll percy is however prone so you have advantage on the attack it's not a sneak attack seven points of damage to you that ends orthax's turn percival you're up you'll find out 2d4 plus two grog you're up good to know all right at the end of your turn (zap) she appears over there her turn came about two of you have actions that have been held percy and grog you're not within range to enter melee so you can do one chain of returning throw attack or throw the axe and let it sit there that'll hit 28 points of damage (impact) it slams into her and the axe slices and carves off part of her arm the giant shadow claw that she still has on the other side clutching the weapon she angrily looks over her shoulder shit that's your turn you can on your next turn 12 no 20 that would hit but she uses her reaction to use another shield the bullet is deflected off an arcane shield on this side she's like axe off grog deflects the bullet this side she is cornered and trying the best she can to get through this okay she is going to use her first attack to reload her pepperbox let's see here okay she is going to look over with her clawed hand actually no she doesn't reload i'm sorry she has that back as opposed to reloading she looks at her weapon puts it in her off hand takes her clawed hand and points a finger over in your direction and releases a single beam of red energy that detonates there in the center of the-- (laughs) okay at level six i believe that's a 3rd-level spell yeah it's gone yeah boom she's not that powerful of a mage multiclass doesn't go that far in a wizard it was a fireball she goes to release it and you shout out towards it she's going to move she's going to take six points of piercing damage and (zap) it's an effect that you are unfamiliar with now that you've been up close and seen the effect roll an arcana check yeah bard of many things 22 you haven't really seen the spell done but you've heard in your travels there are certain mages certain not-too-powerful magics that essentially cause individuals to occasionally blink into another dimension briefly and then come back out that ends her turn vex you're up yeah all righty sure go for it 31 that hits it's 4d8 piercing and you would probably add your additional lightning damage strength save that is 19 okay so the brambles reach up out of the arrow and wrap around him all the thorns constricting and tearing into him actually he-- no he doesn't have disadvantage on saving throws just on his perception and attack rolls so yeah he does break free and all the brambles shatter and break off around him you go for your second attack which is 31 hits roll damage down to the wire clutch counterspell man 18 damage nice all righty so that ends vex's turn vax you're up there's nobody currently in melee or someone who is up against him because you backed away from him when you got up you were still-- no when you got up that's the space you were taking you're still within melee he has a ten-foot reach you would have been up but you're still out of melee of him or out of your own melee sure you are still in his melee range by the way he has a ten-foot reach right there that will get you out of his melee range but he will get an attack of opportunity on you all right he will take his attack of opportunity on you yes at disadvantage also because of the sunlight so that's 25 and 19 you duck underneath all right finishing vax's turn keyleth you're up a 15-foot cube you can do right there and not hit any of your party members and it'll hit orthax has a constitution saving throw 16 so 2d8 thunder damage go ahead and roll that and it's pushed ten feet away from you ten points of thunder damage reduced by half because of his resistances so he takes five all righty it blasts him back orthax (growls) okay go for it kynan is still on the ground wrestling with the whole circumstance okay kynan looks up at keyleth standing up after stabbing her and watching her fall seems to be really noticing the tide turning looking up toward you-- sorry he grabs the dagger from the ground-- he takes the dagger rears back with it and flings it to the side toward orthax (cheering) you slam both blades into the side of orthax and the form itself the shadow's sparking the sunlight is scarring and pocking the back of this oily surface that is its muscled shoulder each blade strike that hits you can see black shadow pouring out like a small waterfall of pure void orthax is like (pained growling) each damage he takes his head doesn't turn his face still locked in pure hatred and vengeance toward percival end of your turn vax oh yeah because that was your reaction scanlan you're up you can move three squares and not take any damage she was right here around there you can go there carefully step away all right you can add an inspiration die to an ability check you don't actually inspire yourself no you are inspiring to yourself at all times ending your turn that brings us to orthax orthax glaring intently is going to move his mark of vengeance as a bonus action to you percy he's going to step forward from vax who is not here he's still in melee do you want to go ahead and roll an attack for vax go for it that hits roll 1d4 plus whatever his bonus to one of his daggers is all right ten damage to orthax he takes the hit and keeps walking forward straight toward you as it walks up takes both its claws back and unleashes on you percy it would have disadvantage in the sunlight but the mark gives it advantage so it's a basic attack against you that is 18 plus nine and the other one is a 14 plus nine so the first hit is 2d8-- no 4d8 because he has advantage on you-- no he doesn't have advantage 21 points of psychic damage you're out yes second strike hits you two death saving throws it's a melee attack within five feet and you're unconscious it's two death saving throws that ends orthax's turn percy it's your turn roll a death saving throw i believe that is not a failure yep ten or higher you succeed (screaming) scanlan is standing where she was last time over here all right so it is now her turn she is going to appear right there just out of reach of both of you this is a five-foot melee attack and she's just out of range of both of you guys when she bamfed out the axe fell to the ground and you pulled it back in do you make your throw attack 32 points of damage as she appears you throw the axe and it's a very short distance so a big amount of your physical strength is put behind it the axe embeds itself right in her upper abdomen and she's like (groaning) it's still in her right now and she's no you're going to throw all right roll with disadvantage mythcarver yeah but you'll have disadvantage so it's your regular attack with no proficiency bonus you're not proficient at throwing weapons so this is a serious penalty what did you roll that's not going to do it you throw the blade and it whips past her as she appears she takes one step two steps there past grog sees orthax whaling on the corpse of percy and that's another name off the list and fires yeah we can get to that we'll see what she rolls you're technically prone so she has disadvantage so that is a 15-- no 13 13 plus 14 27 roll a d10 and reduce her attack by a d10 no he is prone and that's given the disadvantage two the bullet sinks into percy you hear the air escape from his lungs as orthax suddenly flares up with darkness you watch as the edges of the barrel some sort of script that was carved on the side of one of the barrels flares away with a purple flash and it seems like some of ripley's wounds heal a little bit she goes now it's time to make an escape and she's going to use a bonus action to misty step that way and vanish as she runs away the axe drags a bit behind her because of the chain as soon as she vanishes it falls to the ground that brings us to vex's turn percy is now devoid of life go for it roll two attacks both hit roll damage all right okay you going to stay where you are up in the tree you fly down this side okay that ends your turn vax you're up trinket is currently unconscious in your necklace currently yes yeah because he's in melee so roll a sneak attack on that 2d6 to that okay that's eight all righty vax okay 24 roll for sneak attack 31 damage okay ending vax's turn keyleth you're up orthax is right in front of you okay thunderwave constitution saving throw that's a nine so that's a failure at 5th-level that's an additional 4d8 so that's 6d8 thunder damage as you turn back out of frustration and blast forth this wave of thunderous energy you watch as orthax scatters for a second and falls into this small pile of shadow on the ground that is now shifting for some sort of focus (hissing) around the ground like a slippery snake orthax is essentially at zero hit points that ends keyleth's turn scanlan you're up okay you take five points of piercing damage to go over and get it gingerly you can't quite get to your sword you can hold a spell too if you want what spell are you holding okay all right that ends your turn back up at the top grog okay you pick up the axe right there where it was on the ground after she vanished okay end of your turn she appears yes otiluke's resilient sphere all right dexterity saving throw against a dc of that's true that would be a 16 the sphere encapsulates her she is now currently bound within the sphere and she looks about suddenly going what what the heck is going on she stands there and fires at the wall and it has no effect okay well first at the end of her turn the last round of the blink spell does not go off yeah she didn't blink out so she's now locked in the sphere and she's starting to look about extremely nervously the shadow of orthax comes and finds her and is beneath the orb and can't quite get through you guys all bring yourself towards the edge for the sake of brevity we'll say it comes back to scanlan's turn and everyone's holding their action kynan actually walks along with you and heads up her hands are on the orb eyes darting around she's trying to think her way out of this you see her face flash in a couple of ways and she looks cunningly at all of you and smiles all right go ahead and roll grog roll your three attacks vex roll your two attacks vax roll your attacks scanlan spell attacks is fine she doesn't have a whole lot of energy left in her engine and we don't even need to roll damage because how do you vox machina want to do this (grunts) the arm plummets to the ground the shadow still coalescing where the wound is the shadow of orthax shoots up into where the exposed wound is with that moment who does what next as she's clutching this you reach forward and grab her by the throat her eyes wide and slash across right now she has no strength to resist keyleth the vines wrap around and hold her in place vex the scream is cut short as the arrow finds its place in the back of the skull the other one straight to the chest grog your blade cuts through the midsection as the grasping vine pulls the lower half down ripley is entirely torn asunder in a final silent scream the shadow of orthax dissipates sputters and vanishes the battlefield grows silent you all turn and look back over your shoulder and see the still body of percy against the tree trunks over there and that's where we'll pick up next episode it's what they would have done there are certain people that have magical divine abilities that have been known to restore life it's happened before to other members of your party we can keep going for a bit-- pike would be an individual to talk to about this the story will continue next week have hope have faith we'll see what transpires it's fun to be the dm
