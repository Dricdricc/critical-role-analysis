think that's it all right cool then let us go ahead and bring the tension up as you guys wander into the flaming core of emon to show down with thordak the cinder king on tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] drake's staying back with the army to help them with the assault you guys made your way underneath through the sewer system made a brief alliance with some wayward clasp who led you to the center of town where the volcanic essence of thordak's mutated draconic form has been pulling volcanic activity up beneath the city you climbed out on top and there at the walled gates to the central cloudtop district which thordak now calls his home and his lair you saw two fire giants guarding the entrance kashaw and zahra in a heroic display bound the giants to place and decided to take care of them while you rushed into the fray bursting through the door due to the strength of your titanstone gauntlets you rushed into the cloud smoke and ember-filled cloudtop district ruins jumping from ruined building to wreck of rubble and stone the air itself is dense and black with dark fume and it's hard to see anything you all carefully gingerly stealthily made your way into the alcove of one ruined building where across the way you see a giant raised central cavern a hole a burrow if you will that is close to 40 feet across apparently your approach was somewhat sensed by the red dragon himself as you watch thordak emerge from this burrow and climb out saying to itself it appears we have visitors (sound of liquid pouring) so as ashley unfortunately can not be with us pike's control and duty will be taken care of by the twins for the evening you guys will be dual cleric-ing tonight indeed at this point in time you guys are all keeping as still and as quiet as you can while figuring out your circumstances you can hear the low growling voice of thordak as he begins to scan the vicinity (growling) fire resistance fire resistance fire resistance-- okay so we have scanlan keyleth vex grog all with fire resistance and percy all right that's pretty much everyone but you i believe right so yeah the entire party thank god is set to resist fire that may help your chances here as you all guys quietly begin to drink and figure out your circumstances-- because i was rolling thordak's perception check to see if he noticed any of your presences as you were drinking the potions i got a natural one he's still scanning and he's still like we can sense you here where are you and you hear (heavy footsteps) okay what are the components of that spell let's take a look here yep that was not a one so as you guys are all quietly huddled over in this broken space there vex'ahlia begins to do her incantation beneath her breath and as you feel the shadows cling to you you hear in the distance ah there you are he has currently moved out to this area and began to asses the scenery i need all of you to roll initiative (screaming) you took your fire resistance potions that's all you had time to do pike has no bonus vex what did you get 13 for you all right keyleth percy you do indeed all righty so with that beginning of the round at the very top percival you glance around the corner and you see sifting through the large columns of smoke that are billowing off each one of these destroyed burning buildings you see the gargantuan form of thordak (heavy footsteps) and looks right over you see all of a sudden as his eyes pass in your direction almost like a cat caught in a light beam as his eyes flare up with bright white light as it sees your presence from here at his size you could get a shot if you moved a little bit jump between these folks there okay that hits in addition to 37 that's nice good opening shot nope all right as you climb up to the top you slam bad news over the top of the stonework and as soon as the barrel catches a little bit of the light through the smoke you watch as thordak's face whips over in your direction (gunshot) the first shot smashes across the crest on the front of the dragon's face you see sparks fly and bits of flame red crystal get shattered in the distance the head spins back towards you and immediately you start shaking and you fire the second shot and it ricochets off of its angry thick hide you immediately duck back behind the wall in all of your focus and all of your attention into the arrival and the crawl into this and thordak none of you noticed that larkin is not with you keyleth you're up so you're casting tsunami you watch as the smoke is instantly replaced with steam in the vicinity completely filling the area with fog as this giant wall of water is conjured out of the broken cracked dry earth and begins curling over towards thordak's front side all right so strength saving throw-- wait any huge or smaller creature he is bigger than huge it's big but the sheer mass size-- you watch as the tidal wave smashes into thordak and splits and falls around him no effect his form is too big-- the water crashes against him he's too big for it to actually have an impact on him actually this fire is out now this fire goes out and water spills down into the tunnel and you watch a bunch of steam (whoosh) rise out of it he's too big it says any huge or smaller creature inside the wall has to make a saving throw or take damage creature caught in the wall can move but yeah it only seems to have an effect on-- i was with you but hey 8th-level spell sorry i'm sorry i didn't mean to so keyleth do you want to use the rest of your movement oh wait hold on-- sorry i scrolled past that part there-- each creature has to make a saving throw so it does affect him the first round it does each turn after that-- so yeah basically as it gets smaller it affects less and less creatures sorry i scrolled past that one that is a 21 so it takes half-- so roll 6d10 and it takes half damage it's fine keep digging this is my battle against you guys okay half of the 35-- it says here that at the start of each of your turns after the wall appears the wall along with any creatures in it move 50 feet away from you so it will move him 50 feet back unless he gets out of it correct he can move through it fine he's too big now he doesn't take the additional damage in following rounds it still has to try and make an athletics check against your spell dc to move at all but it doesn't take any additional damage it's her first time using this spell guys so be patient we're figuring this out as we go that's as far as you can get with your full movement over here that right there is as far as you can get with your full movement all right that ends keyleth's turn jarett is going to go ahead and rush around here pulling out his heavy crossbow he's going to go ahead as he runs past releasing a bolt towards thordak-- two bolts actually that is a-- nope that misses that also misses well they both hit but they both splinter across his hide all right jarett's going to make the full move behind this wall and begin loading another bolt it's all right we got this it is now gilmore's turn gilmore is going to-- as he watches jarett rush off and keyleth rush back around the wall watching the wall of water crash past the dragon goes all right it's been a while since i've had to do this and he points his finger up towards the dragon's head and you watch as this green spark shoots this single green beam in the direction of the dragon's face let's see if it makes its dexterity saving throw that is-- yeah he succeeds against the spell dc yeah he succeeds with a 19 he goes and fires and you watch as thordak sees the beam glimmer out of the fingers and he ducks down and it fires past dodging between the side of the head and the beam goes casting out that way no effect 6th it's okay we've got this and he's going to go ahead and-- scatter right he pushes past and goes running this way all right that's going to end his turn grog okay you get right about there as thordak has the same initiative as you thordak who has dodged the beam and is seeing the ants begin to scatter in front goes moving targets-- we love moving targets and he's going to step forward-- --and is going to rear back and (inhales) (whoosh) and unleash flame breath i need vex percy vax pike scanlan trinket grog and gilmore to all make dexterity saving throws hold on to that number no the flame is like napalm kima fails gilmore rolls a one are you serious cutting words actually can reduce the damage i'm double-checking that i'm pretty sure it does yeah so you can reduce the damage by a certain amount for everybody all right so-- wow that's a thing she has advantage on her saving throw-- kima does make her saving throw all right so go ahead and roll your d12 and it will reduce the damage no instead of 99 points of fire damage it is 94 94 points of fire damage it was 99 now it's 94 it reduces the damage of the attack grog what was your-- nope yes 24-- you just make it yes you do 18 nope 21 nope okay thankfully that's half damage so that would be at half of 94 37-- i'm sorry no 47 47 points of fire damage to grog to percy to scanlan-- well trinket does not take half trinket goes right into your necklace you didn't succeed so you would take 94 but because you have fire resistance you take 47 you take half of 47 because you have fire resistance and you made the save nope that regenerates it would be 23 correct they can come back yeah okay kima's doing okay but gilmore is looking rough as the flames burn through hyper white red orange blazing fire you haven't felt heat like this before you instinctively close your eyes but it doesn't seem to help as the flames pass by you keyleth you can even feel the impact from here singeing your eyebrows and you have to cover your face for fear of being disfigured by the proximity as the fire eventually burns away gilmore is like stumbling right now burned all around the rest of the party is already smoking bits of your outfits and edges of clothing are now actually curling up and burning that was bad so that ends thordak's go grog yes you may sure 19 misses but his armor is hard 25 hits so the second attack hits are you doing-- right but i mean are you doing your frenzy for the third attack or are you going regular all right 21 misses but you did get a hit in 36 nice as the flames subside from the dragon breath the flames part and you see rushing out flames curling off the edges of the fur this angry raging goliath (yells) runs and takes one swing it skids across the scales of the front of thordak's chest gleaning past the giant scar in the center no damage thordak (laughs) you look up into the beaming star-like eyes and angrily (yells) this time the axe sinks in and the laughter stops you see the slight twinge of pain in the right eye of the dragon as you pull back for a third one brings its claw up and swings down to try and crush you as you swing for your attack you instinctually realize it's probably best to let this go and you duck out of the way in time as the claw (slam) into the ground in front of you vex your turn you feel for the first time the adrenaline surge through you and you suddenly go my brother's been hoarding this this whole time everything slows down around you ever so slightly and for a second your mind's racing faster than it normally does you can move 60 feet you'll go over there and as you're rushing past keyleth-- percy by the way i need you to make a concentration check it's a constitution saving throw that hits your hex fades nice so already at 29 damage plus-- plus 17 all right 46 points of damage on the first strike what's the dc on the strength saving throw yeah he makes it ten plus 12 that would have been amazing as you run past and fire the first arrow it sinks in and jams into the side of where the plates of the chest armor meet the scar as it hits you watch it cause a spurt of dragon blood knowing exactly where the weak points of the armor are being a person that studied dragons you should have the additional damage i think it was plus two damage against creatures that are-- do you want to go look it up you see the brambles extend out from the arrow and the dragon leans forward already focused on grog as you're slamming him in the side as his body flexes the brambles shatter 27 hits yep so 24 damage that final strike nice you did almost 100 points of damage in a single round (cheering) as you rush past looking up into the face of the creature that you know for certain seeing it there that this is the creature that brought your mother to her end and half the city of byroden to the south and as that anger swells into you and mixes with the surge of adrenaline in your body and you don't even feel the momentum your hands instinctively go through all training all the years that have gone by as each arrow gets loosed there is just kind of this fuzz this kind of numbness around as your hatred is focused so clear on this dragon's head and then the air rushes back into your lungs and you slam your back into the wall preparing for your next round all right that finishes vex's go vax and lady kima go at the same time what do you want to do okay the potion of healing correct okay wings are up all righty okay at a non-hasted fly speed oh because you are hasted with the potion so yeah not a problem land right next to your sister you swoop up right in front you cast the vow of enmity oh but we are going to get there as you swoop up within ten feet of his face and cast the vow focusing on him the dragon grins and as you pull out of his attack space because he has a reach of 15 feet with his bite he is going to take a bite attack at you that is a 32 to hit you can that's actually a bad roll 17 points of piercing damage plus-- plus 16 points of fire damage reduced to half well because you have fire resistance that is reduced yes 25 points of damage to you kima is going to-- that's kima kima can't do too much at this distance unfortunately she is going to cast aura of vitality on herself correct what that does is allows her to heal people as a bonus action for as long as it lasts which is pretty damn helpful right now let me pull it up real fast let's see aura of vitality she can use a bonus action to cause a creature in the aura including herself to regain hit points she's doing okay she looks over at gilmore who's hurt on the ground staggering over in flames as she rushes up casts the spell on herself holding her holy symbol of bahamut to her chest she looks up at the dragon remember me without even losing her vision she puts her hand out like this and you watch as a beam of divine energy streaks out slams into gilmore's side he almost doubles over as it swirls around his body and heals his wounds for 2d6 so he heals four hit points all right that is going to end kima's turn pike's turn okay ten feet of movement to get there what else is she doing this round beacon of hope is a 3rd-level spell if you are casting a 3rd-level or higher spell as an action you can only do a 2nd-level spell as a bonus action so you can either do beacon of hope and then a 2nd-level spiritual weapon or-- within 30 feet of her grog is just out of the radius gilmore kima if you run to there okay yeah that would get grog gilmore scanlan percy keyleth it does not get either of you so that's your action you can do up to a level two 2d4 plus five anyone who is affected by the spell all healing is maximum for as long as it lasts and it's concentration okay that ends pike's turn pike can technically move five more feet from where she is no she's out in the open right now scanlan you're up take your d12 inspiration die bards are great all right that's your bonus action 7th-level bigby's hand where do you want bigby's hand to appear within 120 feet all right so what are you having the hand do so clenched fist and that is with plus 2d6 for each sorry plus 2d8 for each slot above fifth that is an additional 4d8 that is 8d8 if it hits go ahead and roll your spell attack 18 no the fist gleans off of thordak's chin the dragon just kind of grins (growls) is this all you've got good all right that brings us back to the top of the order now at the top of this round we're going to start doing lair actions it happens after percy's turn though so percy your go that wasn't a save that was your attack on the next saving throw he has to make he has a disadvantage yes percy what are you doing as far as you can get with your full move yeah when it comes back to his turn i have to roll to see if he gets it that round 26 hits nice so both shots as you are running past you watch as it slams into the sides causing a little (explosion) out of the side of thordak's armor the scales slip for a second the second shot smashes a small hole in one of the wings but you watch as the leather seems to be largely unaffected by the impact it's already tattered at the bottom anyway but well done so there you are at the end of your turn thordak's going to go ahead and use one of his legendary actions to do a tail attack against grog right now because you're within range that's going to be a 25 to hit yep you take 22 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to half so 11 points of bludgeoning damage to you grog all right that ends that at this point now you watch as through the clouds this winged figure comes and (crashing) lands on this distant building the flames flickering out as the impact happens you watch as thordak turns and grins there you are oh you're going to taste so good raishan grins from the side not to worry my king at this point she will-- let me pull it up oh there you go there's the spell sheet she's going to go ahead and move right there gets right up onto the building that you guys are hiding behind as you feel the rubble and rock tumble around you you look up and you can see the giant green leathery wings unfurl she inhales her chest expanding (cheering) does not make his-- wait this is a poison oh it's constitution he does make that he takes 38 points of poison 38 points of poison damage on that one as thordak rears from the attack oh you'll die especially painfully no he just takes poison damage all righty so that ends raishan's turn raishan's like now get in circle and finish this yes you can yes okay okay so make a melee spell attack against him so roll a d20 add your spell attack bonus 28 hits contagion we'll put that blue there so at the end of each of the target's turns it has to make a constitution saving throw after failing three the disease takes effect so as you're rushing up running past the tumbling rocks and boulders of the barely standing ceiling that raishan's stepping on you rush towards thordak and getting closer you see the immense size towering above you and getting this close there is a heated presence around him like an aura of superheated air that burns you as you get close enough to touch him you reach out and grab as you cast the spell under your breath and as you touch the edge of his scales it's like touching a hot iron (sizzles) your fingers singe upon contact but you feel the burst of druidic energy pierce through the scales and you watch as a little bit of black power seeps into the body and curls in between the scales and has taken root can't do third level because you cast a 5th-level spell all right so 2d4 plus six 14 you heal 14 all right at the end of your turn thordak's going to go ahead and use his next two legendary actions to use his wing attack thordak now being surrounded by everything goes (wing flapping) he begins beating his wings you watch as the flames on the ground begin to curl up into these small tornadoes in the presence from the sheer vacuum of wind up under the wings i need grog and keyleth and raishan to make dexterity saving throws so you stay put hunkering down for this keyleth you suffer 13 points of bludgeoning damage 13 points of bludgeoning damage and six points of fire damage yes and you are knocked prone as the wind blows you to the ground and the dragon can move up to half its movement speed so it's going to pull back to there you do as you get hit by that by the way you can do retaliation or you can do your attack of opportunity either works right now go for it go ahead and roll your brutal damage there 37 nice yes okay so as the wind beats up and the dragon begins to back up-- --hovering off the ground you strike out with the-- technically yeah it was reckless you cannot do great weapon master on the-- well i guess you can on any attack you make i'll double check on that real fast so we'll say that's right there i'm going to double check just to make sure on your turn so no you cannot do that so 26 yes you reach out with the axe amongst the heat and the wind blowing in your face (wind blows) and strike across the front of thordak's chest as he begins to swing back with his wings beating out all right at the end of that turn as thordak does that at the end of that turn raishan's going to use two legendary actions to cast blight on thordak constitution saving throw from thordak at disadvantage that's a natural one he is going to use one of his legendary resistances he takes 18 points of necrotic damage all right and because i initially forgot it lair action lair action indeed for that we're going to choose-- the two twins that have currently ducked around the way you feel the ground nearby begin to shake and down below you the earth cracks open and a giant column of magma (explosion) shoots out and sprays in the vicinity you've already used evasion actually you're right you're right you haven't gone since then all right dexterity saving throw from both of you okay you both take-- you succeeded on the save so you take zero you however take what would be 12 points of fire damage reduced to half so six all right that ends keyleth's go it's now jarett jarett who's loaded up his crossbow is going to go ahead and spin around take two shots at thordak that's a cocked die that's good 18 plus seven hits and the second one just barely hits actually there's two hits on him five points two ones in a row for damage are you serious okay and then he is going to try and move back this way to keep everyone scattered and use the space to his advantage that's going to end jarett's turn no it burst and then it cooled and covered the space all righty that brings us to gilmore's turn gilmore who's in a bad place is going to go ahead and take his superior healing potion that's true yeah so he takes 16 20 24 plus eight is 32 nice gilmore who currently drinks the potion this is already not the best start to this but let's see what else i can do here he's going to try a hold monster from where he is right there that's a wisdom saving throw for thordak yeah that succeeds that's a nine plus-- but he tried thank you he goes darting behind the other building off the opposite side yeah that actually doesn't help in this circumstance that ends his turn grog it's you and the dragon's go you both are going at the same time so what are you going to do basically yeah he moved away from you this side over here yeah you can get over to there you are go for it 19 the first strike you slam the axe as your form grows rushing up next to the dragon grinning feeling the foam gathering at the corner of your mouth you swing with the axe and carves a small line but doesn't actually penetrate the armor of thordak that hits 22 misses roll damage on that strike 36 points of damage nice so as two blows are deflected from the armor one does sink in pretty hard carving a piece of dragon flesh that's dangling off now in the torso region thordak's like (snarls) insect is that your turn yeah okay thordak begins laughing (deep laugh) the fire breath does not come back it's a two nope however he does make a full multiattack and that's four attacks against you and it's with advantage against you okay that's a 34 natural one and a 15 that is a 32 natural 20 okay natural 20 (laughs) okay so a bite two claw attacks and a tail attack against you as its tail swings down and whips towards you so first the bite attack you suffer 16 plus a 12 28 points of piercing damage reduced to 14 as well as-- 19 points of fire damage reduced that to nine so that's the first that's the bite attack the two claw attacks against you that is 18 points of slashing damage reduced to nine and then the critical on the claw attack that is-- no that's just the bite attack that is 32 points of slashing damage reduced to 16 and the tail attack that is also a crit 24 36 points of bludgeoning damage you can yes go ahead and roll your d12 36 so 16 points of bludgeoning damage and as part of his multiattack he also uses his frightful presence so everyone as you see it clawing at grog it's like (roars) the tail whips down and slams the ground the entire ground quakes and you feel all the flames grow brighter in the vicinity while thordak is large in this moment it's like staring at a fire god i need everybody-- everyone yeah all of you are immune to fear except for jarett jarett does not succeed jarett is pissing himself right now behind he almost ran into the wall and is like oh this is not good (yells) raishan does make her save does his turn's not done yet raishan uses her legendary resistance to resist the-- oh sorry she doesn't have to because she made it from the shaking and the quaking you watch as the flames that brighten up leap out of the sides in the form of two fire elementals that leap out of the sides of the cavern thordak is going to move around grog to this side he moved around it it's fine the elementals are now going the same turn as thordak 50 feet ten 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 this elemental 35 40 45 50 right there they're going to rush up and get into base to base with you guys and up to keyleth who's currently on the ground prone as the elemental (roar) and comes up against you you hear the familiar sound of the flickering flame of its elemental form rush up towards you all righty at this time you also hear a distant sound in the sky a (sharp whooshes) but you make no visual everyone roll a perception check this is not dragon-related all right scanlan you rolled a 21 you said so scanlan keyleth and vax you guys see a shape in the darkness of clouds and the smoke ahead in between the sounds of thunder and lightning in the distance you see the bow of the skyship deera (laughs) vex it's your turn with your bow you have quite a few options so you'd have to move around this way or this way it is it'll get a swipe at you if you try to move away from it as a bonus action yeah with haste yes you can 18 does not hit so you rush past disengaging you hit up against the edge of the wall with your arrow out (arrow whoosh) it arcs past and misses that one hits the hide but ricochets off 25 hits so a total of-- so 30 nice all righty so the final arrow releases and (whoosh) gets stuck up under one of the scales on the side of where its shoulder and body hits and the dragon thordak turns and (roars and laughs) you hear the voice ring out don't worry we'll take them down all of them each and every one that ends your turn vex all right vax and kima (chuckles) kima frustratingly so being a short-ranged lady that she is is first off going to glance over and see keyleth on the ground how are you doing keyleth yeah she's going to go full double move on this one she wants to get into the fray and is so frustrated that she's too far out of the way kima is going to go ahead and rush out and do a 2d6 heal to gilmore again so that's seven to gilmore oh that's right 2d6 so it's a full 12 kima is now taking a full 50 foot move 50 okay she's charging in we've done this before and we can do it again as she has her holy avenger arcing over her shoulder running screaming (yells) vax what are you doing okay right so you're up in the air now yes it does that includes the smite damage as well it's 2d8 i'm currently working out how much movement you've done because you're crazy it's about 65 to get up to his face all right and you're going to pull back from him the blade which has jammed itself right in the cheekbone under the eye of the dragon as you draw it out there's a streak of dragon blood (roar unhinged laughter) you arc over as you do he reaches up with his face his jaws (snarl) reach out to try and bite you that is a 21 to hit the jaws snap in the air just as you coast through with your wings sure you are going to have an attack of opportunity from-- oh no you disengaged from the-- oh sorry so the fire elemental actually would have gotten an attack of opportunity on you as you ran past that's a 20-- yeah misses all righty that ends your turn kima's turn pike's up however at the end of vax's turn thordak is going to go ahead and use a tail attack against grog disadvantage which is good because it was a natural 20 and a six plus 16 22 makes it it keeps going it lasts for seven days however it lasts for seven days but remember that's if the spell succeeds if he succeeds three saving throws it goes away yeah fail three to take effect succeed three to just get rid of the disease so anyway that brings us to pike oh he was doing the tail attack to you so using one of the legendary actions to make a tail strike against-- at the end of someone else's turn yeah because you're right there with advantage that would be 31 so yeah that hits you 20 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to ten all righty so pike what's pike doing that's as far as she can get he's within 60 feet i mean that's as far as she can get yeah so you're up 70 hit points grog she can't because she already cast a 6th-level spell if you do a spell that's higher than 2nd-level you can only do a 2nd-level spell as your bonus action technically rules as written you can't do that but as we've been playing for the sake of having so many players i allow bonus action spells as long as they're level two or lower yeah sorry she can okay so at second level that means that's 2d4 plus five so 13 you heal 13 hit points all right that ends pike's turn then scanlan you're up yes all righty go ahead and roll a spell attack that hits it would've so 8d8 points of damage to the fire elemental 41 points of damage nice it slams into his form and you watch as his body kind of tears open for a second the flames dissipating and then form back in but they're starting to flicker no no bonus let me double check when you cast a spell as a bonus action it says here you can move the hand and cause the effects it's your bonus action to move the spell so your action is there i'll say-- it says specifically bonus action correct to do that is your bonus i'll let you do it again if you want to no okay so it would be over the edge of that wall there and (blasting noise) all right go for it so that's a no that is a 12 for its dexterity saving throw so it takes full damage 15 points of lightning damage against the fire elemental okay the bolt hits it and the fire elemental goes (sizzling) not terribly damaged by the impact okay do you want to stay where you are okay that ends scanlan's turn up to the top percival there 25 hits well you have to decide whether your-- if it's a piercing shot affecting also kima or grog because it's a straight line and it hits-- depending on how you angle it you're either hitting kima or you're hitting grog yep nope as per the rules as designed no she's parkouring off of the damaged wall trying to get into the fray with the dragon and happens to catch where the bullet would be going this is true so grog it is roll for attack against grog in theory from this angle in to hit the fire elemental and thordak he has to aim up 20 against grog hits and roll against thordak correct only the additional attack can misfire roll damage once okay grog you take 13 points of piercing damage halved to six round it down six yeah basically yes it is 32 to hit that'll hit go ahead and roll damage and it just gets pushed back ten feet its form gets knocked back coalesces again as a flickering flame creature it's looking hurt it's barely keeping its form together at this point it's still standing all right all right that finishes your turn percy now you watch as the skyship deera pushes through some of the clouds and you can now see a series of small shapes as it looks like a half-dozen wyverns are currently harrying it from the sky attacking it you can see some sort of combat going on on the bow of the ship but you also watch as two of its arballists are set up and fire towards thordak that actually hits that's cocked and yeah a 16 and a 15 with bonus it hits both so they're both super-heated they are flaming arballists fire doesn't have an effect but they still do piercing damage for a total of 22 points of piercing damage you watch these two large thick heavy metallic piercing bolts come arcing through slamming into thordak's hide the flames flicker on the edge where it impacted though it has little effect and thordak is (insane growling) (insane growling) (maniacal laughter) two of the wyverns apparently noticing the fray and peel off beginning to make their way down to where this struggle is happening at this point in time i'm going to do-- yeah okay (laughs) grog and kima suddenly the ground quakes beneath you and it splits open and a very thick yellowish-green sulfurous gas just spills out in the vicinity immediately filling your lungs and causing your chest to seize just from breathing the air in i need both you and her to make a the area is now heavily obscured so now there is a heavy smoke all in this area right now yes it does you don't do anything yet you don't do anything yet on your turn you'll do it it may for raishan's turn as smoke has filled the area (coughing) you're having a hard time-- raishan sees this picks up off the ground as the wyvern begins to strike first i'm going to see if her breath comes back it does not seeing the new creatures in the fray is going to rush up and interfere with this one immediately and just do a full round of attacks against the wyvern that'll hit that'll hit that'll hit bite and two claws yep that wyvern is looking really hurt as you watch as raishan reaches up and just tears into its side and claws into its belly they're both wrestling in the air almost in a momentary freefall then catch themselves again raishan just clings on the wyvern is already in a really really bad place that ends raishan's turn at the end of raishan's turn thordak is going to do another wing attack he's going to do another wing attack at the cost of two of its actions picking up the wind around it once more i need grog kima's just out of the range thankfully grog i need you to make a dexterity saving throw you do nope but it does push it 17 nope you take-- 16 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to eight and you take eight points of fire damage reduced to four from the impact and you are knocked prone so you are now prone on the ground and this gets pushed ever-so-slightly this way off of you onto keyleth pike kima currently the dragon does shift keyleth you're up initially i need you to make a constitution saving throw 19 you succeed you manage to just hold your breath and the poison doesn't makes its way and fit into your lungs yes you do it's pushed back yeah so it's not in contact with you okay he's looking pretty rough yeah quite a ways away i'd say close to 65 70 feet from you yeah right there you can you are immune to poison just so you're aware because of the heroes' feast thordak doesn't know that okay thordak's going to make a saving throw this is constitution success so half damage half of 35 all right as the blight spell takes hold you watch as the tendrils of black necrotic energy begin to carve between the scales of thordak's body you watch as portions of the scar in the chest split almost like a fresh wound a little bit of pus begins to pour forth it's nasty sure you are just inside the doorway right now with percy actually you can't quite get that far because you were knocked prone so you're just barely no you can just get in there so you're good well it is a 30-foot range blight has a 30-foot range so we're going to take that damage off no because she was prone at the start of her round she can only move 15 feet he is 15 feet from you ten feet okay so in that right there what level you're going to do first level okay that is a what save constitution that is a 17 so it does not succeed i don't think no because she aimed the-- it's a cone right radius so yeah your hand would have to-- yeah so you can just go right there you're fine as you get up off the ground the smoke you slam your staff into the ground the smoke around you dissipates momentarily as the shockwave hits the fire elemental it just turns into ash and vanishes you have 15 feet you can move now you can tuck in yeah since you did move that time there you go travis at the end of keyleth's turn raishan's going to use a legendary action to make another attack against the wyvern that will hit and that will do it with that the wyvern gets its head ripped off by raishan the body plummets the lizardman that was riding it ends up falling off slams into the ground nine points of bludgeoning damage as it hits the ground it's still alive but it's looking up at this green dragon that ends keyleth's turn jarett is currently afraid as shit he's going to reload and look over he has to roll with disadvantage against thordak from that distance can't get closer even with disadvantage hits on the first attack with 16 and 18 misses with the second one yeah with the crossbow still manages to do 13 points of piercing damage to thordak which is nice jarett is then going to finish moving out of visual sight of this like nope nope nope behind the wall (panting) this is uh this is a terrible idea they're not paying me enough for this no he was focused on thordak he was just like (yells) that ends jarett's turn gilmore's turn gilmore is dodging out of the outside of the cloud and goes all right let's see if we can try this again he's going to go ahead and move up into the building just outside of the radius looking behind where the window is busted open he's going to blow his one 7th-level spell as a lower-level spell of disintegrate once more up towards the chest where it's kind of cracked open that is a 24 13 plus 11 that hits that's an additional 3d6 to that that's 13d6 plus 40 points of force damage so it deals 88 points of damage to thordak (cheering) that is the end of gilmore's turn that brings us to grog and thordak first let me see-- this roll is going to-- yes i would like to go first laura after getting disintegrated thordak who was focused on you his attention keeps shifting from place to place he's not focused in his current mental state (enraged roar) and you watch as he heaves you see the flames flickering brighter and brighter across him (fwoosh) or actually he'd be right there laura sam you do get an attack of opportunity against him yeah because you have advantage if you hit so go ahead and roll twice 27 hits go ahead and roll damage with the sneak attack 51 points of damage as thordak rushes away from you (pained roar) as you cleave across his underside you watch as the blood just spills out (wings flapping hard landing) actually no he's not going to land he's staying up in the air thordak is currently up-- i did yeah hold on a sec grog will calm down he's going to fire breath that's going to be grog kima pike and gilmore and the hand so i need grog and pike to roll a dexterity saving throw that's still not enough that's 102 points of fire damage halved for both of you so 51 points of fire damage no no to both of you so 51 points of fire damage to grog and pike pike needs to make a constitution saving throw to try and maintain concentration what's her constitution save not enough so-- it's half the damage you take she had to roll a natural 20 she probably couldn't have made it yeah so beacon of hope is gone beacon of hope is gone you took 51 points kima rolls a natural 20 on her save so she takes half damage at least so kima's still up kima does not maintain her spell unfortunately gilmore rolls a natural 20 on his reflex save that's awesome and thank god so he's still unconscious gilmore is down and in flames right now unconscious thordak is 50 feet up okay so you stand up okay 29 hits 30 points of damage good go ahead and roll while you're raging you have advantage on strength rolls was it athletics or strength so roll again you yank the axe back down catch it in your hands you did the extra 1d4 damage from being enlarged right that is going to end thordak's turn now it is the elemental over here it's going to (flame crackling) over next to percy that's a bonus action yeah go for it 1d10 plus one ten hit points all right all righty let's see vex you're up it's your third and final poison arrow it just barely misses raishan on the way that hits you're not sneak attacking because nobody nearby can hit him right he makes his save okay this is the one you've had this is the one you've kept this whole time right you reach back and you pull and there's two there's two in there you pull one out look and there's a small piece of paper attached to it it arcs into the darkness past the clouds and out of the cloudtop you still have movement if you want to do something else there's small flames here and there but there is a wyvern up above the wall now that seems to have noticed you as you went around the corner and fired a few arrows you don't have anything to hide behind it notices you over the side you can move if you want to and try to do that you could move around here and duck inside there go ahead and roll stealth that's a 14 all righty i forgot to do the fire elemental attacks against you percival from earlier fire elemental attack that came over there and attacked you it was during thordak's turn i forgot to do that it gets two touch attacks against you that is 13 that's cocked natural 20 17 points of fire damage halved to eight and you are on fire you have to use an action to get rid of it so yes and every turn you'll take 1d10 fire damage until you get rid of it all right so finishing vex's turn it is now vax and kima's kima's going to make a constitution saving throw kima makes it and is unaffected well she's unaffected by the poison anyway because she was part of the heroes' feast yeah kima is angrily going to rush over to gilmore it's true it's true kima is going to go ahead and lay hands on gilmore she's going to heal him for 35 all righty so as kima rushes over still staring at thordak up in the air (wing flapping) she hand vaults over the destroyed wall runs over to gilmore's unconscious burning form and moving her hand out of the way to put the flames out pats him down and as her hand glows and she slams onto his chest and you watch (gasping) the breath come to him as his eyes flicker open she goes it's not your time yet buddy picks up her sword and angrily looks over towards thordak again she can move five more feet that way that's as much as she can get this turn but that's her action pike's turn sorry vax's turn yeah but you're up there okay so you have the sword and whisper both attuned yeah go for it can't legendary resist against damage no it's only against saving throws without the bonus 102 points of damage against thordak all righty right here okay so as you rush up sword at the side jam it to the hilt to the side of thordak's haunch and upper torso area using the momentum behind you you continue to push forward and yank the blade around like a can opener just cutting through the scales and hide (pained yelling) and as you tear through the blade it comes out the other side cutting through the flesh as you spin around with your wings still out in front you spin with whisper and slam it into the open wound with the exposed crystal hitting the crystal with the vestige (shattering) there's a flash of light and you continue downward landing off to that side as you turn around and look up you watch as the crystal begins to crack (shattering) (gasping) all right that's your turn all righty that brings us to pike's turn pike has to make-- nothing because of the poison yeah so what's pike doing okay gilmore's not too great okay he's within range right so that's 2d4 plus five yeah beacon of hope is gone all right that's as far as she can get right there okay that ends pike's turn scanlan you're up yeah you can see it from there it's high enough in the sky you don't have to arc around you can go (magic shooting noise) okay makes his save yeah he takes half okay 11 points of lightning damage you can move him up to 60 feet per turn no the spell's range is 120 per turn as a bonus action it can move at 60 feet (laughter) okay so the hand (whoosh) goes up punch him roll a spell attack whiffs let me check real fast let me see here makes an attack roll plus ten bonus 23 just hits (cheering) 8d8 4d8 and you cast it it's usually fifth level you cast it as a seventh level it goes up by 2d8 every level higher yes just punched the dragon in the face with bigby's hand top of the next round percy first you take you take ten five points of fire damage that is terrifying oh my god goddamn it i'd say yeah you can do that the wall next to him there's nothing above him here so you can move around and get on the wall no there's no spike there's a crack in the crystal that's exposed there's no metal pole no he got hit by a vax okay you can spend them once you roll to hit wait until you see you hit it then you can spend the points that hits okay okay 22 misses the first blast fires off it impacts the side of thordak you watch the little charge of energy shoot through second shot however goes a little wide as you feel the fire still burning up the front of your torso it's enough to distract you from your actual aiming okay that ends your turn percy at this point the ground quakes beneath-- no he can't do the same twice in a row so it's going to do another magma erupt (laughs) beneath where gilmore is the ground splits open-- (groans) 18 for you all right that's okay gilmore rolls a-- 15 which is enough kima rolls a natural 20-- (cheering) that's 21 that's ten points of fire damage to both kima and gilmore that was halved as that bursts off you also watch as the airship deera coasts around this way and takes three shots (cheering) it charges into the fray this way on the outside of the side of the cloudtop make a perception check you barely have a view of it so yes you can no you're inside the room you see it this one does not appear to be coming from the direction they were with that it is raishan's turn raishan gets her breath back raishan rears back (hissing roar) releases the same poisonous torrent toward thordak he takes half damage as the poison cloud billows up (cough sinister growl) you're still around us that's okay there's still time to eat raishan is going to fly past and land on the top of the roof which nearly crumbles nearly crumbles above you keyleth you feel stones (crash) around you and you see raishan landing on the ceiling of this damaged building as parts of it begin to collapse that ends raishan's turn keyleth you're up okay it does wait so what spell are you doing you're doing-- so percy i need you to make a dexterity saving throw yes so roll 4d8 bludgeoning damage percy takes and percy is knocked prone but is no longer on fire however the unscathed fire elemental is turned to mist water pushing past and doing way too much damage for him to-- but a full health fire elemental is turned to mist and is immediately destroyed actually the force of it blows out the rocks from this side of the wall and the wall the wall here actually gets knocked open to that side as the tidal wave pushes out keyleth do you want to move or stay where you are okay he did yes it was a 13 plus he's only done two so far since you cast it no because you didn't do it your first turn you did it your second turn so yeah twice yes yes (laughter) you from your current perspective you do not okay jarett who is currently scared out of his wits ha he's like what no why would you look at that and he goes and takes two more shots with disadvantage against that's a miss second shot disadvantage is a miss both shots firing off gilmore who's now conscious doesn't have a whole lot else as far as attack spells go is going to attempt to stand up all right that was-- (groaning) i can count that travis and then stop giving me shit as he gets up he leans back and backs out of the rubble takes in his surroundings sees the magma receding from the crack in the ground this is you guys bring me to the greatest places oh he's not looking too good and releases a lightning bolt he's not looking too good and he's going to release a lightning bolt at fifth level a 5th-level lightning bolt a 5th-level lightning bolt thordak makes his save and that will be come on dice 49 half that will be 24 points of lightning damage against thordak that ends gilmore's turn grog and thordak all right what are you doing 31 that's awesome yeah you pull the axe back thordak is going to swoop in let's see here i know right there gilmore just behind raishan right there lands right up next to pike everyone else in that vicinity yup and (inhales) rolled a five on that because pike keeps healing everybody that'll be towards jarett scanlan and pike i need you guys to make dex saves how many more bardic inspiration dice do you have by the way you've inspired one and you've cutting words twice correct all right cool this is your fourth roll a d12 what was pike's dexterity save again (laughing) oh no what did you get nah roll your dexterity saving throw jarett does not make it either all right well well with the damage reduction from scanlan that's only 100 points of fire damage cut in half so that's 50 to each of you jarett is practically immolated his unconscious body hits the ground crisp smoking he's currently going into shock and is in a really bad place right now yeah you can get right up behind him right there yes you are sure i'll let you do it it all happened at once 29 hits 29 all righty that ends your turn oh yes you should sorry thank you it's a constitution saving throw so you add your constitution save with that bigby's hand fades the spell knocked asunder thank you for reminding me of that so that comes to end that turn yes he does and that is a seven plus 16 no he doesn't have disadvantage on every save just the one he was cutting words'd you're right same thing so with that the third save is made contagion it's a rough couple rounds with the sheer amount of clouds of ash and blackness in the air you have no idea where it went i'm afraid at the end of thordak's turn the wyvern that had seen you it did spot you your stealth was not very good it leaps down into the back of the building and (growls) coming towards you the wyvern's going to make a multi-attack the first is a bite attack against you that's a natural one does not hit you the stinger however is a natural 20 wow so that is for 12 points of piercing damage to you and i need you to make a constitution saving throw liam and that's right so no effect the rider is going to swing at you with a heavy club and then a javelin that is a 16 what's your ac nope and no misses you with both you're just too quick for him the giant sees percy lying on the ground and goes (yells) with its giant two-handed sword it's going to make two attacks against percy with advantage 19 so that's 30 for the first one and a 22 with the second all right so you take 28 points of slashing damage from each hit all right that brings us to-- no that brings us to vex's turn you're back here right now yeah well i have you right here because you actually fell and your base came off and i glued it together when you were talking like any good dungeon master should so you're inside this building right now no so you just run out this way you have a lot of movement speed so you're still out here at half movement go for it make your shots 29 all right you should have said that before okay that was the first roll second attack okay one lightning damage all right i'm looking it up right now actually dc 17 constitution saving throw yes he does which he makes so he takes half damage so it's 6d10 32 halved all right you release the first arrow which goes and strikes thordak in the upper shoulder wing area (growls) he turns around and goes to face you the arms and wings open angrily as you release the dragon-slaying arrow it goes and hits the side where the chest is currently disintegrated and exposed as the arrow using the power of fenthras behind it slams into the crystal the crystal shatters as it breaks you watch as thordak goes (crazed laughter) and the form begins to slowly shrink (growling) he seems to be grinning and laughing through the pain as the swollen primordial dragon form of thordak begins to slowly wither and wither that's still a pretty fucking huge dragon (laughter) now there are hanging folds of dragon hide skin the form shrunk but portions still are sagging off of it at the end of your turn he's going to use two legendary actions to wing attack trying to whip the wings much faster now due to the somewhat dire circumstances i need pike and currently just pike to make a dexterity saving throw nope pike takes 20 points of bludgeoning damage and eight points of fire damage reduced to four he's going to fly up-- there we go you both do really so go ahead and roll damage for both of them yes you do no you add those two so roll the damage first and then double the dice correct you double the dice including the d4 and d6 from your weapon and your enlarged status nice and pike's okay perfect you both strike as the now-diminished form of thordak begins to pull backward eyes looking around the piercing star-like white light of the eyes seems to have slowly recoiled into a glowing reddish-orange and you can now see where the crystal once was in the chest there is just a gaping hole where bits of flesh and dragon muscle are hanging out occasionally slopping out of the wound he's pulling back all right yep okay misses hits 22 hits yeah okay you're going to stay there all right so you are currently up here in thordak's face cool so that ends vax's turn kima-- that wyvern just can't seem to keep itself standing she's just going to move towards raishan she's going to move over to this wall okay that's ends kima's turn going over there pike's turn pike is knocked prone from the spell earlier well she has to roll to attack with her spell bonus her spell attack bonus 24 hits 26 nice as the guiding bolt slams into the side of thordak's side you can see this glimmering beacon of light the next attack against thordak has advantage so 2d4 plus five to herself okay jarett went and got you illicit drugs scanlan eight okay so jarett is healed up eight points where the terrible burns are most of them seem to heal or at least scar to a point where he comes to consciousness he's like what happened right grabs the crossbow to the side leans up so was that pike's turn all right was that pike's turn scanlan you're up you roll it that's fine correct so you recast bigby's hand go ahead and roll a spell attack so plus ten to that 23 hits so that would be 27 nice all right percival unless you want to move scanlan percival your turn 4d4 plus four yeah correct 23 hits that's an additional 4d6 damage your hair sticks up a little bit your nipples get a little pointy (laughter) okay one of the fingered claws of thordak gets blasted off from the impact from bad news the energy arcing through the rest of his arm from cabal's ruin the second shot however having to aim manages to just barely miss vax he gets in the way of the shot and you have to shoot wide and it misses entirely is that your turn at the end of percy's turn thordak's going to go ahead and use his third legendary action to do a tail attack against vax that is a 22 to hit all right so that brings us to-- we're going to say this will be all right the ground shakes a 60-foot radius around the dragon as just the presence of thordak the ground just begins quaking beneath you watch as fissures of small volcanic energy begin to break from underneath pretty much everybody-- yep except for you who's in the air need to make a dexterity saving throw it's a fighter ability pike grog keyleth percy pike gilmore all get knocked prone from the ground quaking as you all fall on your back you manage to brace yourself against the wall real fast vex (laughs) no he just gets shaken on the ground raishan does not get her breath back she is however going to utilize chain lightning all right chain lightning dexterity saving throw that's a success for thordak sorry i'm trying to get through this okay so that is halved halved that is 18 points of lightning damage vax make a dexterity saving throw 26 okay you suffer 18 points of lightning damage as the bolt of energy that strikes thordak then arcs into you because you're right next to it no you've already used it so yeah that ends that going to take off and land right there next to that guy that's the lizardman that fell from the wyvern keyleth you're up keyleth you're up no what's the range on blight nope thordak is 50 feet in the air you could climb up and cast it if you wanted to try that all righty thordak's save is 19 thordak's going to use his second legendary resistance to make it so go ahead and roll damage 8d10 so half that is 24 points of lightning damage raishan's not even in that range you do not have visual range on percy right now sure you move into the house okay still prone but better that end your turn all right jarett's turn jarett gets up jarett still only has a view of the dragon and is like what happened to-- that's weird missed the whole exchange but gets the gist of it disadvantage misses natural 20 disadvantage 15 still hits not a critical unfortunately but a ten on damage that's 13 piercing damage no i think that would instill more fear logistically right gilmore gets up from the ground so he's going to cast another 4th-level lightning bolt thordak fails his save is going to use his last resistance to get that 'cause he's doing real rough he's rolling shit tonight 14 points of lightning damage no 16 okay all righty that's gilmore's turn it's grog and thordak's turn okay thordak is 40 feet up sure right now yeah you have advantage roll again 38 points of damage sure you can get right there thordak who is physically falling apart at this point sections just sloughing off and just the whole experience has been sending his physical-- his whole physical form is wrecked right now the word escapes me that i was looking for he's going to go ahead and turn and go into a full flight you're riding him dash into the dark hole within you need to go ahead and roll a strength saving throw to try and maintain grip as the dragon goes into a full dive 15 you do manage to make it inside the tunnel but you lose your grip and then go into a full tumble hitting the ground it's a decline it's a 45-degree angle downward yes roll an acrobatics check to stop yourself 25 okay so you do tumble and come to a stop you don't take any damage from the fall and you stop yourself from doing a tumble but it is still a decline into darkness below and you just watch as the back end of thordak's barely flying form slams into the side of the tunnel and continues swooping away he just begins to leave outside of your darkvision as of right now we are yes so finishing that is thordak's go vex you're up okay so you are hasted so you get down and you basically have just enough movement to catch up to your brother and you get the broom out you're both down there in the darkness by yourselves you guys watch as the rest of them dive into the hole vax you're up how far does your darkvision go for he's outside of your darkvision this is happening after your turn so you begin to dart forward well your movement is not 120 feet you're still flying through there right so your wings are still out there okay okay so yeah you begin to come in you see him just begin to come into your visual range still away from you okay you land on his back i would say you have disadvantage on these strikes as you're currently gripping onto a flying dragon underneath a cavern ripping through you have advantage on them automatically which means you don't have disadvantage on these strikes but you do not get the automatic sneak attack no no essentially you would have advantage and then trying to grip onto him and through the middle of this tunnel and slamming into him you would have disadvantage and so they both cancel to just a regular attack what was the first one 24 hits second one was a natural 20 all right correct 21 nice okay how do you want to do this (yelling) as the blade plunges into thordak's now-sloughing and soft flesh exposed through a series of wounds and gashes left behind by your allies and his form just slowly shriveling into its diminutive space the dagger cuts cleanly through and with that force you go all the way up to the shoulder as you reach inside as you finish saying your phrase your eyes narrow and you clench your teeth and as you pull back and yank there's this strange series of low whispers that come into your ears and as you pull back you watch as these bits of greyish energy begin to pour out of the air coalescing around the blade fitting into the body where you're currently plunged within as you yank outward you watch as the blade almost has an extended edge about ten 15 feet beyond whisper's actual-- and this blade edge just leaves a giant wound on the side of thordak's body you don't even hear an exclamation of pain as thordak just slowly slams into the ground of this low barely glowing tunnel roll an acrobatics check with disadvantage 25 so with the speed and impact of tumbling you manage to reduce the damage by half so you-- right that is 17 points of bludgeoning damage no that's halved so that would bring it to 8 as you watch thordak's form sputter roll and then tumble grinding to a halt gathering a bunch of stone broken rock and part of the cavern that's on the verge of collapsing from the impact of thordak's body now lifeless still in the darkness subterranean tunnel and we're going to take a break (yelling) you want to and now we'll take a break so we'll be back here in a few minutes check out the video here during the break and we'll be back in a few minutes guys [break] you'll receive this awesome dice tray signed by us half of us at the break and the other half will sign before the night is out but it's coming your way real soon congratulations detectivekane get this out of my fucking face somebody take it from me it feels so good to be able to do that but it feels better when it's immediate otherwise it feels like kinda good all right so picking up where we left off the rest of you watch as thordak swooped into the hole that he emerged from quickly followed by vex and vax there is still on the field-- raishan just tore into this lizard man we have a fire giant that is unscathed currently bearing down on the rest of the party and a wyvern rider back around this wall section here that being the case they end that turn there first up is lady kima who is pissed that she hasn't had a chance to really do anything tonight against flying dragons that's what she's going to do paladins that don't fly and have haste have a hard time getting around just so you know watching this giant whale upon percy pisses her off and she cracks her neck you're first and she leaps down and she's going to multi-attack against him that is-- that hits and the other also hits even with a minus five on each for her great weapon master she's also going to divine smite on that at a level three first strike is a 14 plus ten 24 plus 11 35 42 points of damage on her first strike against the giant and the second strike is 24 points of damage so that fire giant's already had a big chunk taken out of its-- kima rushes up and double strikes with her holy avenger one cleaving off a piece of its armor the second one cuts through leaving a giant flash of divine energy as it bursts out the side she looks up in the eyes and says bahamut says hi that ends kima's turn pike is up now technically-- i was going to say the giant was going on thordak's turn order so i technically skipped the giant's turn that's fine i'll do the giant's turn now the giant who has watched percy get pulled away steps in to get into melee range with both kima and grog and is going to take a strike on each takes an attack on kima and rolls-- that's a 20 that hits and then roll grog-- that is a 29 that's 28 points of damage to kima and-- it's fun to roll against the players 33 points of slashing damage against you grog 16 21 that hits 32 points of damage nice the giant already in that round of attacks and your retaliation is-- it has its giant greatsword on the ground it's rearing up for its next round of arcing attacks that brings us to pike what's pike doing now all right go ahead and roll a melee spell attack 18 just hits nope it does but it's not the same the giant sees the flash of light as the bolt comes towards it out the corner of its eye as it has its blade down it instead ducks underneath using grog for cover briefly as it arcs past its shoulder and shoots off through the cloud out of sight it's not okay d4 plus five there you go six points to pike scanlan you're up yeah bigby could just get into range melee there for it that hits go ahead and roll your 6d8 we'll go with 34 on that cool so as the giant ducks out of the way of the guiding bolt streaking past it snickers and grins says something in giant which you hear which is-- you didn't even hear what he said yet insolents bow to your king and then as it brings the sword up while it saw the glimmer of the guiding bolt it didn't see the purple glimmer of the shining fist as it comes up and whack right across the jaw dislocating it briefly as the fist comes back up and is ready for another round still standing but looking pretty rough that brings us to-- okay greater healing potion is 4d4 plus four yeah yes so 14 hit points you heal correct correct all righty scanlan that finish your turn percival okay so are you getting up go for it all righty hits so as the fist clocks him across the face dislocating the jaw it stands up and grabs the jaw and snaps it back into place looks up just in time for you to come up out of the shadow and (gunshots) turning the barrels you fire and the first shot hits in the side of the throat and blows open the neck and you see as the blood begins to gout out reaches up with a hand and it (gasps) but it's to no use as the other shot takes out the right eye blowing out the back of the giant's head as it falls backward okay all right that ends percy's turn top of the round the lair actions do not function however you watch as the skyship deera still rotating around there's still wyverns attacking you hear the distant sounds of lightning cracks as well and you hear very very distantly what sounds like a-- sorry internet-- a cacophony of voices because there's no other word to describe it hundreds and hundreds of voices all shouting combat war cries simultaneously you have no idea how far away it is it's very very faint you just pick it up you hear the sound of impacts of crumbling stone in the distance there is a battle happening all throughout the city that is slowly making its way towards your current location deera's turned around and is going to take two shots at raishan because it's going to fire at whatever dragons are there damon was not notified of anything otherwise rolled an eight and an eight no it does not hit oh she gets three attacks because the-- three eights in a row that's ridiculous yeah that's not a three that's an eight absurd so yeah (boom boom boom) all on the ground and raishan spins in place (growls) call off your dogs we still have a deal which raishan at this point is now leaping (whoosh) and disappears into the portal-- or down into the hole in the ground all right at this point full speed that is-- 60 feet yeah you guys as you're having this moment hugging each other-- you hear (wings flapping) (smash) the ground shakes nearby as you turn and see you watch as raishan skids to a halt right next to you and the currently smashed corpse of thordak within the tunnel raishan is watching both of you as she begins to walk towards thordak's corpse and goes you've done well 80 foot flying this wyvern swoops in the one that was left earlier that was after you is going to swoop in and attempt to make two strikes at kima miss and a three miss and the rider's going to go ahead and make two strikes at her as well miss with a 17 and a two kima's like deflecting getting against the wall as the spear shoots by and as the blade comes down from the rider she strikes it with the sword and stops it mid-air and she starts laughing in his face that ends its go keyleth you're up are you doing a double move double move are you doing a dash action okay so you begin to make it into the hole that brings us to jarett's turn jarett is going to turn the corner he's like so it's gone okay good loads the crossbow sees the wyvern and goes are you-- no are you-- seriously and takes his shots nice 19 yeah two shots against the wyvern 14 points of damage he's not the heroic individual you guys are necessarily he is in his own field all righty so that ends his turn there those two shots both sink into the wyvern both bolt stuns (snarling) that will end his go gilmore recognizing the circumstance here and everyone's rushing in there he's going to go ahead and okay he'll go actually me first and he dimension doors to the edge and begins to charge in after you guys that brings us to grog okay so you move into melee with the wyvern and the rider hits we'll say for the sake of brevity you're going to wipe out the wyvern because you're giant grog the lizard man is left yes if you want to well all three of your attacks would be what it would take to take out the wyvern so as you finish cleaving the wyvern down it falls over and the lizard man's like (snarls) (reptilian whimper) it looks conflicted vex it's your go you have raishan like (booming footsteps) stepping over to thordak's body watching you closely exactly what we talked about learning his secret okay the tunnel that you're in it's been a steady decline it's rounded off a little bit and it begins to open up maybe 70 feet ahead of you actually with your darkvision you would just barely start to see it begin to open it looks like there's an actual chamber ahead of all of you guys but you haven't reached it yet okay so as you move in you can see there's a very very faint glow of orange and red in the room and the whole tunnel here has a very very very concentrated natural burning chemical smell to it a lot of sulfur-type very putrid pungent smells and the glow you can now see there is a lava flow that is coalescing in the center of this room or at least is pouring through and it looks like it's bisecting this room you don't make out much more detail than that at this distance but you do see this chamber does have an actual flow of liquid rock vax okay pike scanlan you guys all follow suit okay at a full run you guys can get at your tiny feet you can get up towards the edge there right percival yeah you do you get up there and inside raishan comes up to the body of thordak and you see that she reaches up under one of her scales and pulls out a small leather case pops open the case and sits back and pulls open a somewhat weathered scroll and starts reading off of it (magical language) okay hold on you say attack based on-- because you don't see this yet she hasn't touched him yet but you're attacking on your own instinct all right i will say for this go ahead and make a dexterity check 28 okay so you can make your attack this with the dagger she's maybe like 20 feet so you can-- well you held your action which means you can only take your action you can't move as well 20 feet that's true you can do that yeah so yeah you can do that a 23 okay so it was-- 29 hits the first one right the 19 was the one that didn't hit no because you've used all your attacks okay so what was the first attack it was-- 15 15 plus nine so the first attack was 15 okay maintains concentration maintains concentration okay so as both daggers come you watch as it's muttering from the scroll not both of her eyes but one of the eyes turns to face you yeah and narrows the scroll finishes and (poof) turns to ash and similar to something you've seen before you watch as thordak's corpse which is currently buried into the rock with the face to the side the breath filters into the mouth the body still motionless you recognize this similar or adjacent magic to the speak with dead-- yes so as soon as that finishes raishan-- the other eye flickers over now both eyes are on you and says know what you're doing (chuckles) okay raishan is going to hmm let me check one thing real fast well i'm trying to see what her reaction's going to be oh okay she feels comfortable with that she goes well then come claim me and just steps away from thordak and with one big push of the wings turns around and coasts into the chamber beyond you beyond you can see her form disappear into the darkness there's a little bit of an orange glow in there but given that circumstance yeah she disappears into the shadows of the room no she's going the opposite direction she flew away from your brother but your brother did throw three daggers into her and then said she was going to die so what are you going to do attack or not you watched your brother throw three daggers into raishan and tell her that she's going to die and then raishan basically abandoned thordak's body and fled flew over you and past into the chamber go for it roll your attacks roll your attacks nope yeah (laughter) hah apparently so roll damage on one arrow strike and it is your hand's shaking at this moment you're trying to figure out what to do when she flies overhead you release one arrow pull back and pull another and the second one is right as she's over and above sinks in and the third one you fire after and it hits the rock ceiling 15 points of damage all righty raishan just swoops into the darkness of the chamber beyond keyleth you just manage to catch up at this point now at a full run this will be your full turn catching up to vex and vax or vax specifically vex is a little beyond aggressive stance raishan nowhere to be seen thordak's corpse ground into the dirt okay jarett and gilmore at this point manage to catch up to you guys as well it'll take a while for grog and kima to catch up to you guys it's true actually yeah well grog it's staring at you going like (growl) make a strength check 25 there's this moment where you're grabbing its head and it reaches up and (frantic snarl) a very riki-oh type moment the head just pops outward in a smear of purple gore (chuckles) bigby's hand claps the wall applause (laughter) you look over at kima and kima's kind of spattered with it and she goes well done all right all right you're going your movement about there full speed kima's a little slower behind she'll catch up at a full double-dash speed there jarett and everybody else has kind of moved in we'll say at this point the rest of you-- he can't do anything he's having a bad day man so you guys all charge in after no you guys are far behind so it's currently you three in the lead do you want to move bigby's hand nah so you guys kind of rush into this chamber now and the heat in here is more immense than anything you felt on the surface this is kind of the core of the volcanic surge that thordak's presence was pulling upward you see within there's this flow of lava i want the three of you to roll perception checks if you can well are you looking for raishan or are you inspecting the room for details i was rolling to see just the general vicinity of the room you guys the first thing you notice as you glance around is there are some kind of alcoves inside this chamber where the rock formations pull inward you see kind of set into the stone and various bits of fallen rock and earth a handful somewhat spread out throughout the room a handful of large nine-foot-tall dark deep crimson red with crystalline elements to the outside ovoid structures these are what appear to be larger than normal elementally altered dragon eggs five of them in the chamber he's a ways back if you want to try and move back to him you can but with your high perception you glance up and see in the ceiling portion of this chamber where there are a number of these small caverns that are pressed up to the side you see out of the top just the slight peeking of raishan's face kind of looking down into the chamber above you and you watch as the teeth something muttering in the mouth the teeth grin as the ceiling of the room you watch distortion in the air above you almost like these small portals kind of (multiple fwooshes) open and coming flying out of them you see four large flaming rocks rocks these are massive fiery meteorite-like boulders that come firing out of the ceiling of the room (crashing sounds) slamming into the ground around you exploding in a massive explosions rocking you all you see is white and ringing in your ears as your bodies are thrown from explosion to explosion i need the three of you to make dexterity saving throws you guys take half damage well here let's do the first part so there's the fire damage which is 20d6 you had to beat 22 right so you take zero damage from this both of you take 63 points of fire damage halved to 31 and then you each take 70 points of bludgeoning damage as these flaming arcane meteors crash into the ground detonating and destroying a portion of the cavern floor lava spatters everywhere and you watch as you duck out of the way as keyleth what are your hit points at 18 points set your hit points to that you watch as your sister is thrown her body unconscious flung in the air like a ragdoll as it scatters to one end of the cavern you can see the volcanic activity billowing up from the recent shaking of the room as bits of the molten rock are flung across as the green dragon face kind of withdraws in the cave and i think that's where we're going to pick up next year (yelling) we will pick this up in january that's called meteor swarm that's a 9th-level spell you're right she has nothing else up her sleeve so on that note this could possibly be a whole different encounter i don't want to keep you guys here until 1 am i know laura has to record in the morning well guys this will be interesting (groaning) regardless (laugh) we are out for the evening thank you all for sticking with us for this longer episode yeah the half-elves are down here in this chamber with the thordak eggs (laughs) anyway guys thank you so much for watching thank you guys for kicking ass in that battle talks machina on tuesday it's the critmas episode check it out
