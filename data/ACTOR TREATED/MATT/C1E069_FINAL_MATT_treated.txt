hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play dungeons and dragons and occasionally leave sobbing messes tonight's going to be a very interesting episode before we get into that let's go ahead and coast through our announcements so we can get to the actual game at hand first and foremost we want to thank our sponsor for many weeks

that's the only room information i was given frankerz is the guy who's sending me the emails anyway speaking of fun news laura you wanted to mention something about some things up on the store it is no joke the most comfortable hoodie i've ever owned i was a little worried when we started doing actual wearable merch i was like it's going to end up being that chintzy stuff that we don't want to hawk but i'm actually really happy that it came out pretty high-quality what anyway anything else you want to talk about nope then let's go ahead and get into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] different guy you in searching these artifacts found that one in the city of ank'harel had been taken out from under your nose by a long-forgotten npc named ripley you know what i mean you gave chase down to the glintshore island of the hespet archipelago and upon storming the beaches destroying her ship you walked into the jungle where an ambush turned into folly you charged into what appeared to be a couple of illusions as the floor detonated beneath you setting you across the ground and starting an encounter with snipers in position at half-health and below for most of you you gave a very good fight and still managed to push through unfortunately dr ripley with the reveal that she has now bound herself to orthax the shadow demon that once plagued percy's inspiration and nightmares bent on vengeance managed to take him slay him and leave him cold on the ground as a group you did manage to dissect dr ripley very aggressively and get vengeance back for your friend but where we left off you'd just let the adrenaline and the shock of the moment hit you as ripley's breath expends and a tiny tree begins to try and break and grow from her corpse on this parched land so what do you want to do all right with a heavy thud sound her hand is jettisoned from the wrist her left hand as it scatters across the broken glass floor of the center of the jungle here in glintshore fair enough kynan is still standing there the adrenaline wearing off of him and he's at a good 15 20-foot distance from all of you just standing (stammers) he looks down and he seems to have dropped it after everything that transpired and he picks it up and holds it take it he throws it to your feet and it spins and scatters and comes to a halt at the tip of your boot i didn't mean for any of this to happen i wouldn't blame them either look after we met i was hurt i was angry i knew i could be someone despite what you told me and i could prove it prove that i was worth your attention and i left emon and my home to seek that destiny and i'm sure many of you did the same you don't know what i've been through look when she picked me up in kymal she taught me a lot i learned a lot she also told me that you weren't who i thought you were when everything went down in emon with the dragons she said you did that you were responsible for it she had me listen in to a conversation where you admitted that it was your fault go for it he seems emotionally on the brim of a complete nervous breakdown but he's holding his ground his hands are shaking in place as he stands staring at you with the look of a man on the precipice well we went back to the cavern to set up but you got here too quickly-- only a few hours we have a few people on the ship well i would ask for a chance to redeem myself but i am also beginning to understand what i've done and i accept whatever judgment you see fit just know that-- just know that i've been very confused (whispering) how can i help whatever you want me to tell you i know a little bit anything just let me know okay okay so you sense as part of your paladin ability divine sense i believe it was yeah as you guys are going through ripley's things you do sense there is a pulse of fiendish energy emanating from somewhere near ripley's body who's inspecting ripley's body a few things you find as you rummage through you find about 1051 gold pieces two weeks of rations some of which appear to have been dampened and will probably be gone soon you do find the cloak the dagger that kynan used still lays to the ground no it was handed to you so you have it right now there is what appears to be a small polished grey stone with a couple of runic symbols carved into it you also find what appears to be a small leather case a long thin case about that long that is latched shut and her gun which is similar to percy's pepperbox but thinner longer more refined it's a deep gunmetal gray color with brass sections and what appear to be portions of whitestone built into it as she pulls the gun out you immediately know that that's the direct source of the fiendish energy yeah it's a slow-growing tree it's only about six feet tall it wouldn't be large enough to use her spell through it this is the remnants of a fenthras death there are a few large jungle trees like i mentioned before that have managed to find root and grow in this jungle it'd be like one healthy tree for every 50 that are burnt charred and petrified there are trees available in this jungle that in theory could be used for that spell if you had it available to you make an intelligence check with plus two because of your jack of all trades add your intelligence modifier plus two 18 that might not work for most spells (laughter) he's still considered a creature it's just a dead creature okay yeah as trinket emerges from the necklace his unconscious form hits the ground laying on the side as you walk up and place your hand still breathing and your warm touch presses across his fur and the breathing inflates into one deep breath and then (bear noises) the head leans up and begins licking your hand as you finish the casting of the spell go ahead and roll hit points for trinket you also do notice vex on the gun it has across the handle the bottom of the handle the name of the weapon which is named animus and across the barrels you now see there are three empty barrels and three that still have names the names are rictor wells oz grud and king bertrand dwendal rictor wells oz grud and king bertrand dwendal apparently all people that ripley in some way shape or form felt vengeful towards that's what she used to listen in on you guys no it's a very different enchantment this one looks a little simpler and upon looking at it there's no magic left in it you did disenchant the other side of the enchantment of her old gun okay as you open the cap on the edge of this leather casing you pull it open you see it's essentially a side scroll case on the inside there is a single tightly wound piece of parchment the smell immediately is very musty and old with a hint of burnt wood and yeah there's some sort of parchment that is tightly coiled in there that was something we found in the cave when we got here but she quickly grabbed it and put it away and wouldn't tell us what it was i only got to the outside of it i was standing guard no maybe a couple of miles it's at the base of the mountain okay make an arcana check well you add it to all ability checks and skills you're not proficient in 14 that's fine that's enough yes it is a scroll of gate yeah you are an arcane caster consider this is an extremely powerful spell that has a lot of various uses so consider just so you know what it's capable of i'm going to read you some of the spell here so gate just so you know you conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different (or the same) plane of existence the portal is a circular opening which you can make five to 20 feet in diameter it lasts for up to a minute the portal has a front and back on each plane where it appears it would be between planes essentially i would say if you wanted to use it as just a teleportation circle you could but it's a waste of a 9th-level spell comparatively to what she can do with tree stride and other things like that deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this from opening in their presence when you cast the spell you can speak the name of a specific creature a pseudonym title or nickname doesn't work specific name of a creature if the creature is on a plane other than the one you're on the portal opens and pulls them through to you so it has a lot of various uses you can bring a lot of things through on that instantly for better or for worse at this point maybe 20 25 minutes you could do that just half an hour to an hour you can do that so you guys take a short rest now to use any of your hit dice to go ahead and heal up and scanlan's giving song of rest so you get an additional-- 1d12 to each one of you guys on top of whatever you're healing he's a bloody mess but at the same time there is a strange look of peace on his face it both comforts and upsets you and you have a hard time concentrating on the face you're just focusing on the body as you clean him and make him look as good as you possibly can using druidcraft and other spells at your disposal make an investigation check 15 all right you find let's see you find 620 gold pieces total across all the bodies you find two pistols two rifles there is also a long-barreled bad news-like rifle that was discarded across the battlefield by ripley earlier in the fight it's busted there is a greatsword and a set of full plate that were on the goliath that you battled full plate yes you find a total of 185 rounds of small ammunition and about 26 rounds of large ammunition for the rifles you find a potion of superior healing on the smashed corpse of the wizard that didn't get a chance to use it before it fell to its horrible death that's a really good one a set of bracers of defense plus two which i think you've encountered previously so you can write that down and yeah that's all you find on the corpses it's a plus two they do need to be attuned i'm pretty sure let me double check i'm pretty sure they do yeah and you have the cloak and you have the dagger at your disposal and the gun if you wanted to take the time to inspect them during the short rest okay so while he's doing that you guys go off to the cave okay is kynan staying behind with you guys okay go ahead and make an investigation check he does yeah it takes you the better part of 30 minutes or so but the needle in the haystack was not as hard a search as you thought and you find it wedged between two branches back in its hard onyx form unscathed seemingly from the explosion all right you guys because you're going to check for traps as you go go ahead and roll an investigation check okay making your way through there don't appear to be any traps in your way and as you wind through the path and there is a walked path following the tracks of the people who had set up the ambush for you and heading towards the mountain where kynan had pointed earlier you do eventually and also watching your sister above and you can see the entrance to this there is a large volcanic-mouthed cavern at the bottom of the mountain before it meets the edge of the jungle you get to it and it's about 40 feet by 20 feet initially and it quickly funnels down all the rock in here by the way is very dark broken porous volcanic texture it looks like this mountain at one point in time may have been volcanically active or at least may still be and there isn't sign of any recent activity there's no smoke there is a heavy sulfurous smell as you get close and actually begin to enter the front of the cave do you guys continue forward into the cavern yeah there's no light source you guys can still see up to a certain distance okay without light little bit of torch light okay go ahead and make your investigation check okay as you instead are distracted by the flaming side of the arrow her lobbing it and suddenly her eyes just glazing over white it catches you off guard the first time really seeing this happen and so you weren't even paying attention to the rest of the cavern you all of a sudden are having an immediate first-person of the very tip of the arrow coasting through darkness the fire itself crackling around you like you're wreathed in flame you can hear the flame licking past your ears almost as you pass through the wind of this still tunnel air eventually coming down you can see the tunnel condenses and then turns sharply right and you scatter against the rock fall to the side we'll see where it lands actually okay you hit the ground and ahead you can see with a little light that the tunnel splits into two but there is there's detail to the walls that doesn't look natural there is some idea of construction here there is structure someone has refined elements of the interior of this tunnel that's the best you can make out with the arrow's placement okay as you guys continue following the path that the arrow did the tunnel winds back and forth a bit it pinches and then curves quickly to the right where you find the arrow still lying there roll a stealth check make an investigation check while you're stealthing it seems safe are you stealthing as well okay the two of you pushing forward the cavern divides to the right and left eventually to the right was what you got the glimpse at to the left it just continues the same kind of porous rock and it's like a volcanic tube that general erosion built a floor that's a little less wide than the walls which are spherical in shape other way to the right where the tunnel curves off you can see what appear to be smoothed-over walls where it's been just either ground down they're not perfectly flat but there has been some amount of effort put in making it a smooth-walled structure that same burnt sulfur smell is stronger the deeper into the mountain you go but not to the point where it's forcing you to cough you do feel a little bit of burning in the lungs from proximity there are a few footfalls going through the dust very hastily they're like jogging-paced footfalls and even just from some of the tracking you've done previously in the day some of these footfalls are of the people that you encountered earlier including ripley okay and carefully stepping forward for the next ten minutes or so it goes from a slightly curved and bunched rock formation into a singular long tunnel that has been pushed into the mountain itself and it abruptly comes to an end in here the soft ashy dust that once formed the floor has given way to crunching of thousands and thousands of tiny bone shards and you see before you what appears to be a cluster of hundreds of skulls that are built up into one altar-like platform everything here is burnt and elements of this look like a large fiery event transpired in here that destroyed much of what once was a more structured interior and this altar while it remains in place it look like it suffered severe damage in the past the skulls and rocks that are there most of them are broken cracked and thrown against the walls this looks very old it looks like this place hasn't been touched in a very long time investigation check you don't find anything that resembles a teleportation circle what you do find is in the altar it appears that there was a compartment that has since been opened up that is left vacuous and empty it appears to have been recently disturbed and once you do that looking at the little bit of ashy soot that was on the outside of the scroll you do get the sense that that was probably what was taken from this altar eventually you guys make your way back to the rest of the camp you've cleaned up percy to the best of your ability you've gathered all the materials from all the other corpses around the battlefield you and kynan return with your onyx dog what are you going to do okay it's a little ways south of the island but it was at the ready all of its various arbalest setups are still ready for war they're basically just waiting for your guys' order to come and attack as you come to the edge you see captain damon immediately rush up and goes we saw some sort of explosion on the island is everyone all right immediately his expression drops and he steps on to the back of his heels and drops his hands in front of him in a very business-type setup i'm sorry where are you going very good i guess if you need me and my crew come find us in ank'harel safe travels crew and he starts shouting out to the rest of everyone on the deck as you coast off you hear him shouting at a distance over the wind we're going home whatever that is these days you hear the flare of various magical crystals the vibration creaks they glow a brighter blue as the ship turns around explain we're outfitted to take down relatively dangerous prey but-- i mean no offense here and the honorable goal is fantastic but i also have a crew to feed make a persuasion roll we'll learn the details later but i'm happy to help convincing them will take some coin but where would you like us to go i've not been there but i can figure it out he looks over and you can see teera who is the halfling with the rotted teeth comes up and goes i know that's by the alabaster sierras i can get us there all right she bows her head and backs away uncomfortable with the tension of the situation captain damon goes we'll meet you in whitestone safe travels the ship continues making its way southward turning around slowly to start turning more northeast direction you guys watch as you see the ship go overhead from the island heading in the opposite direction of ank'harel eventually vex makes her way back to your location on the island okay as you summon scanlan's magnificent mansion you all come to a familiar space spectral servants waiting to wait on you but the somber atmosphere still remains you find your way to your respective rooms and if there's anything you'd like to do before the evening's rest now's the time to speak up all right you take that and cover him up and put him currently to rest on the ground kynan is still by the door yeah of course he doesn't say anything you guys take an evening's rest within the mansion you recover half of your hit die whatever your maximum hit die is you recover half that for the evening's rest you're at full hit points and your spells are returned to you grog is at level 15 so you would get back eight of your hit dice that you've spent all right what's the plan as you guys make your way to the front door you see kynan is leaning against the wall of the front his knees pushed to his chest he hasn't slept he has big bags under his eyes he's just staring at the floor he's not reacting he acknowledges as you place it down he doesn't drink any of it he stands up slowly and just follows you like a ghost right now what's the plan it doesn't take you long you've seen a few that'll work in your initial travel into the jungle here you find one thick jungle tree that's probably 35 feet up slightly curving at the top one of the few living trees in this forest it's a nice wide solid trunk so it's perfect for you to do this as you all gather around making sure you have everything you need keyleth you reach out touch and mark the space where the doorway is to open as you finish the casting of your spell the bark of this striated palm tree-type structure falls away into the entrance on the other side you can see that brief hazy glimmer of a cloud-covered day at whitestone you all quickly rush through one after another portal closes behind as you all stand now leaping outside of the sun tree in the center of the main town square in whitestone it is getting close to the sun is setting it's later in the afternoon evening all right there is still that faint shimmer on the sky above you as you guys arrive a number of people who live in whitestone-- as you guys begin walking away from the sun tree you can see a bunch of townsfolk and some guards begin to walk up to greet you and be like you've returned-- immediately the energy is felt and everyone steps away and gives you space as people begin to see the limp body of percival being held over grog's shoulder right away the guard rushes off up towards the castle whitestone are you guys walking towards the castle whitestone as well there is a temple being built here yes no the temple would be within the city itself pike you who have been suffering a very sleepless night feeling some amorphous heartbreak that you haven't been able to define yet that has prevented you from closing eyes without spells of sudden anxiety and sadness hear the voice come peeking through and the immediacy of vex's tone is both comforting and immediately confirming a terrible fright that you've had lingering at the back of your mind you guys beeline there the temple is still under construction and construction's been slow due to the scenario that currently exists on tal'dorei many folks instead are putting a lot of energy toward defenses and training in case anything bad happens in whitestone there are a few worshipers that have converted to sarenrae and are helping but pike is still the central place of what is a basic stone structure that is slowly being outfitted as you approach it's pretty much a hovel but is making its way as you approach you can see the front door open and there pike's form long silver- and gold-colored evening wear her hair tousled around her face the little bit of wind that's blowing through causing it to tumble against one chin she looks out the rest of you with sadness across her eyes you all make your way into this room there are two other people that are helping around they're general townsfolk they're not heavy into any specific use aside from cleaning and helping construct but they bring a large table out and you guys set percy on top of it there are two spells at your disposal there is resurrection which is a 7th-level spell it costs a diamond worth 1000 gold which the spell consumes or there is raise dead which is a 5th-level spell which consumes a diamond worth 500 gold pieces but the target has to have been dead no longer than ten days the same thing but the person could have been dead for up to a century i would say being a 7th-level spell i would give a very faint modifier depending okay whole with both spells he comes back whole if it works okay pike you begin to set the stage for the ritual you begin to pull out the sage this temple as simple as it is but simple is the nature of sarenrae one who does not have much worshiping influence in this world you know that she requires just enough and the faith is stronger than the presentation but you pull out the best you can all the offerings that are necessary you scrawl out the various divine runic symbols that represent healing that represent connection to one's divine entity that represent stalwartness and strength of heart that represent love and family everything you can think of that really binds this ritual to the moment as you guys are sitting around to prepare you begin the incantation of the ritual the first stage allows you to reach out and make contact with the spirit wherever it is after five minutes of searching you have no way of locating it the spirit currently-- something is blocking it you know it's out there you can sense that there is an essence of percival but it's like it's blurred and there's something blocking it the ritual's unable to reach out you may have to think about it as keyleth hands you the gun that strange blockage becomes crystalline what was once a dark spot that was preventing you from clarifying your vision is now a clear patch of shadow having seen this once before orthax is indeed blocking the ritual and is currently hungrily feasting on the soul of percival i would say pike make a religion check and make an intelligence check scanlan actually yes you can as well holding this the essence of orthax a shadow demon like this orthax was not destroyed and sent back to his plane orthax cannot be sent back to its plane when it's bound to whatever its crux is whatever object that orthax has used as its focus holds it in this plane and it cannot be destroyed on its plane while it's attached to that object the gun right now is essentially the anchor that orthax is using destroy the gun or find a way to break the connection you want to try a greater restoration spell is that what you're saying yeah that's what she did for-- what are you doing pike you take animus from her the pepperbox and even holding it there is this dark weight to it it feels like lead and cold in your hands as you concentrate channeling the divine druidic energies that currently you're focusing into it your vision comes to a similar dark shadowy mass that pike had seen during the attempt at the resurrection ritual you can see there is indeed a connection there is a tangible gateway between this weapon and orthax the shadow demon there enveloped in the darkness you can sense in your heart of hearts that's where percy lies as you begin to focus on greater restoration you begin to feel the nature of the curse that binds him to it and you reach out in this space you guys watch as keyleth reaches out into the air of nothing but within your sight and your vision you can see that thread and you grasp it as you hold it with your fingers you feel it fight you watch as keyleth's hand bolts around with nothing in her grasp you hear the voice whisper no no i finally have him i finally-- and with that you snap with your fist the shadow screams and vanishes and there you see a brief glimmer of light the remaining spirit of percival as it drifts off into the astral sea the spell finishes the gun itself you guys see a flash of shadow around it and it dulls all the names on the side vanish as well the barrels are now clean okay as you go back into this ritual that blockage is gone now and you can see clear the somewhat tattered-around-the-edges but whole and existing soul of percival the ritual makes connection and with that that coldness becomes a warmth and a familiarity as you reach out and implore the spirit to take your attention and come back now who wants to aid in this resurrection ritual who has something to offer as a part of this skill challenge inspiring whoever wants to be part of the ritual yeah you can go ahead and inspire sure go ahead and make an investigation check 25 you start rummaging through his coat and you find his gun retort you find a bunch of random bullet casings and bullets you find a cluster of papers and notes that are folded up in a small book and what appears to be a partially sealed letter with no name on it you eventually find some of the whitestone glass the green glass that you guys had flashed around in ank'harel the raven skull is still on him it hangs around his neck yeah all right what do you want to offer to the skill challenge for this event something that you as an individual bring to this and bring to the connection to percy to try and-- make a persuasion roll i trust you okay who else wants to add something to this ritual if you want to inspire pike pike could attempt to bring something to the ritual and then could use your inspiration die on top of what her check is so how do you inspire all right you have a d12 inspiration die pike what do you want to try and bring to the ritual on top of your casting the spell to draw him back what do you want to bring to the ritual i know you being the pious woman you are what you've used in the past religion has been optional your connection with sarenrae in this is important if there are other skills you can think of that you'd want to bring to this as well that you're good at that would fit this circumstance you can try anything how well it fits will depend on how high the difficulty class is i'll let you yeah all right roll a d10 let me know what you roll first what'd you roll okay sarenrae is with you but the intervention the divine gate that separates the gods from the prime material plane still stands she's lending what energy she can in this moment imploring to her and the connection you do have through the divine gate i want you to go ahead and make a religion check roll a d20 and add your religion modifier okay do you want to add your d12 inspiration from scanlan all right gotcha one final skill challenge check to make who wishes to add to this i'm going to say between the two of you on that i need you to make a charisma ability check with advantage because of vax helping you this is in particular a challenge for you because persuasion's already been used you as your point of leadership and strength of character you're piercing through the veil and through the ritual to appeal to him as a person to another through sheer force of charismatic persuasion with advantage adding your charisma bonus 19 you feel pike the ritual begin to culminate the divine energies lent to you by sarenrae fill your form and you watch as pike's physical form now seems to overlap her divine form you've had at a distance she is this radiant golden image of herself the same golden wings flaring up around her you watch as percy's body begins to rise off the table the arms and legs limply hanging underneath the chest rising up the light from pike begins to create a small well of divine energy that spirals down into his chest and blasts through him and the table the table itself cracks beneath him yet he still remains aloft as the energy hits the energy fades the ritual completes the room grows still and cold and dark once more pike's divine form disperses into golden feathers that drift and disappear across the wooden floor percy's body slowly lands onto the table stillness stillness (inhalation) breaths begin to fill his chest once more unconscious as he is life is slowly returning to percival as is color his pale skin pale as it's ever been but now slowly stirring i'll take a picture of that just so everyone knows still unconscious percival get back in your chair let me tweet out the photo real fast actually this would be a great time to go ahead and take a break we're going to go ahead and go take a quick break those were some good rolls man and apparently a convincing-- i was literally waiting for a text from taliesin to let me know based on how the ritual went whether or not percival felt it was enough to bring him back even if it would have succeeded we'll be back here in a number of minutes all right guys we'll see you here in a few minutes [break] yes you can his glasses are cracked at which point the door slams open and cassandra's there with what appears to be seeker asum and a couple of the guards from whitestone where is he is he all right oh he's all right (laughter) she walks up to you at the table and leans over and stop getting into trouble brother please she runs her fingers through your hair a couple of times and looks down her stern expression melts into a warmth and appreciation and she feels the coldness of the body and goes-- you can see her putting together the setup the ritual your emotional state and the damp cheeks she looks over towards you pike and nods and says thank you get some food in you and stop being so bloody useless and slaps you upside the face and turns around and leaves the temple roll an insight check pike roll a deception check what'd you roll pike what'd you roll a deception check she's lying through her fucking teeth grog so you go and heal him up you guys make your way back to the castle the guards are there waiting as you enter you can see there sitting in the foyer talking and discussing is jarett and gilmore who both look a little nervous and intense about apparently recently hearing what happened as soon as you enter gilmore turns i take that as a good sign he's standing oh come here you white-haired fool then he runs forward and lifts you up with a hug that hurts so much he holds you up for a second and sets you back down i know that hurt (laughter) you'd be at one okay gilmore goes i see you've also been prolific here let me have a look he takes the cloak and folding it over his hands you see the sparkle of energy through the blue inside of it he's like very interesting he puts his hand over it and his eyes flare with arcane energy this is indeed cabal's ruin one of the vestiges of divergence well to be specific about this once attuned to whoever's wearing it you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects which is pretty badass if i do say so myself also when you're hit by some sort of asshole's spell out there you can use your reaction to have the cloak swallow part of it you halve the damage you take from the spell if there's any damage to be taken and the cloak gains a number of charges equal to the spell level of the triggering spell it's the filter of game rules you don't get a vestige now you get whisper keyleth (laughter) it gains a number of charges equal to the spell level that you absorb up to a maximum of six charges can be stored in the cloak so six charges if you have the cloak on and you hit with an attack you can expend any number of charges from the cloak to deal an additional 1d6 lightning damage per charge yeah onto an attack that you deal with the cloak that's what cabal's ruin does no in fact it doesn't channel through spells it channels through physical attacks melee weapon attacks is how the enchantment works what do you mean i'm doing fantastic it's a little rough but it's okay (chuckles) i'm doing my job just as you are i mean you all look tired exhausted and emotionally drained so do i so i think we're all doing our part (chuckles) ah yes thank you i appreciate that well thank you when all this is done i should go visit it's been a while taken a while give me your dagger he takes it runs his fingers on the blade the slight curvature to it out there to the point he does his identify forged with a mercurial metal pulled from the far realm light dances and shifts across this curved blade it has a plus three bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the dagger it also deals an additional 1d8 psychic damage on a hit whenever whisper is thrown you can choose to transform into shadow and merge with the blade teleporting instantly to wherever the blade impacts which means you can teleport as far as you can throw the dagger which is the max range of the dagger yeah so 60 feet you go wherever it throws to if the target is a creature you emerge adjacent to the target in a space of your choice around the creature whenever you critically hit a creature with an attack with whisper the target has to make a wisdom saving throw against a dc 18 or become frightened of you for one minute it's up to you guys yeah the minute you throw and hit something it immediately teleports you if you choose it doesn't have to happen you could throw it and then it hits the ground and you stay where you are if you want to but if you choose you can travel with the blade and essentially appear nightcrawler-style in shadow next to whatever you hit you have to be attuned to whisper yeah if there was anything else you need me to look at i still have a full score of simple tricks is there anything else you want me to look at before i go to bed because it's late at this point now the sun has gone down it's i'd say nine in the evening he takes the music box eyes flare up no it's an impressive music box marquesian but yeah don't pronounce it please it's offensive huh well he blushes a little and closes it i think it found the right owner it's an instructional guide you might learn something maybe you start taking classes in marquesian (chuckles) you scan through real fast and yeah you only got a little ways into the book when you first looked at it in the center there's probably a good 30 pages of really beautiful old-- it's essentially the kama sutra (laughter) yes i'm glad to hear everyone is doing okay and it's good to see you here in one piece how was your journey right if you brought some yes that is a lot of fusaka thank you very much that lasts a long time you paid 50 gold for this oh you got swindled my friend (laughter) well thank you great i'll give you some tips on how to prepare it but you know what i'll cook a classic marquesian feast in the coming days for all of us in thank you for the spice yes who's been ghosting you guys the whole time looking extremely nervous all right a friend of you is a friend of ours you are able-bodied kynan is taken aback by the whole thing his eyes are wide still staring at you slowly he starts talking out the side of his mouth to jarett yes anything whatever i can do jarett walks up and puts his hand on his shoulder and goes well first off you need to be more assertive you are talking like a sniveling coward you need to project your chest shoulders back and when you speak you speak with intent and-- ah it's late we'll work on it tomorrow oh before i forget this came for you keyleth traders came in a parcel in your name don't know who it's from i don't know they were sent from westruun i think it was read the letter first make an insight check vex looking at handwriting and the way it's scribbled out the scribble is hastily and little bits of text that come through it appears that they are just thoughts that he may have felt uncomfortable putting in the letter after writing them out and then scratched them out there doesn't appear to be any serious agency or danger around them it's getting later in the evening close to 10pm comparably even though you guys woke up maybe three hours ago physically you're sore and you're drained the essence of the ritual and the following healing spells-- you're physically whole but there is a very physical toll on you from the ritual as well no but you feel like a walking bruise and every movement of your body is fraught with such physical exhaustion that you haven't felt and only time is going to take care of that you're effectively at minus four to any d20 rolls you make until you rest then it becomes a minus three then another night's rest becomes a minus two so you're in a rough spot for the next few days unless you're resting consistently for the brief moment you have consciousness as you enter the room it is a wondrous welcoming sight you have just enough time to get that thought across before you facedown in your bed and right to sleep clothes still on facedown from the corner of the bed it's a terrible sight but you don't care the rest of you what do you wish to do it hurts a little and you're proud of her for it it actually causes this strange collision shockwave it pushes you back a second because there's too much strength in one fistbump shaun goes for a moment maybe i should probably rest as well jarett jarett goes you know what yes drink sounds nice it's been a while good company kynan's still in shock and nods and slinks-- as he walks behind you he walks with his head low and you can see he averts his gaze towards the ground watching where he's going to be walking gilmore individually gives you all a brief hug or handshake i'm sure we'll talk more tomorrow i'm going to go join percy's plan of action you recognize him pike as you say that looking at him though much more harrowed a little more built than you last saw him but this is the young man who was waiting for you guys outside of greyskull keep a few months back asking to join who was bright-eyed and inexperienced hi it's one of the things where he's always looking down but you step into his field of vision already being shorter than him as you're looking up at him with your gauntlets there at your side he's looking at you but he's also not wanting to look you in the eyes a little bit hello pike it's good to see you welcome back we had a bit of a technical difficulty there but apparently we're back up and streaming and everything's good so we're going to jump right back into the story where we were just gouts of it anime-style like fist of the north star spraying so having pike check kynan kynan's looking at you pike what are you going to do okay looking over and you finish the spell there is no sense of evil from him make an insight check i'll say with advantage because of the nature of the spell because why not (laughter) because he is a broken man standing before you you don't sense any evil in the sense of what the spell would gather you do sense from looking at his expression his reaction and what bit of information you have this is a person that's been heavily brainwashed and their idea of what the world was or as it was has been broken probably many times kynan's in a rough spot and the guilt is weighing so heavily on him right now that it's probably best that somebody keep an eye on him looking down at your smiling blue gnomish eyes this broken boy of a man does mutter a slight chuckle in reaction then catches himself and nods i have a lot to think about i have a lot of penance to deal with thank you maybe a drink would help jarett smacks him on the shoulder all right then let's get this pup trashed follow me he leads you down to one of the two taverns the one that had been destroyed as part of the initial battle here in whitestone has been constructed the roof's still mostly missing but they have a covering over it it doesn't appear to be a rainy evening so it should be fine there's a handful of folk in there having drinks jarett treats you all to a round of finer ale of whitestone brand they don't have a large selection of rare imported drinks here but it's enough to at least get the job done anything you guys want to do specifically while you're all having drinks tonight he goes i am not familiar with this you say this is from ank'harel to friends and to survival make a deception check he gives you a keen look looks to vex nods to friends and trust make a constitution saving throw the fiery rumble in your stomach is matched directly behind by the heavy flow of numbness that fills the entirety of your chest jaw and tongue jarett goes (heavily slurred) that was quite strong (slurred) you fucker (laughter) please don't i think that i have far more than you do and it's too short anyway be a waste of your time he became castilian suddenly me too he keeps looking over at keyleth and you see every time he sees her he has that spike of guilt in his heart make a persuasion check most of this conversation his eyes have been darting away from connecting with yours the evasion has been persistent but as soon as those words finish his eyes finally lock with yours and stay with you he takes a beat and goes i know what i've done and there's no way i can express how sorry i am the woman i followed she was confident she was persuasive and she picked up what others wouldn't and i bought into that and that shows once again that i was never ready to begin with like you said and i appreciate that wisdom in hindsight you were kind of a dick but still i'll do my best i can't make any promises but i'll do my best yeah okay you guys share a silent drink and he immediately goes back to his drink and takes another sip we're living in the broken future of technology thank you for your patience so as kynan's avoiding eye contact with keyleth and getting progressively drunk as the evening goes on occasionally you see him smile hearing other bits of conversation the positive presence at least of you guys being somewhat forgiving in the moment and the fact that percy did come back alleviated some of his guilt he's doing better than he was earlier definitely but he's still very inward jarett is having hilarious conversation with grog as it progresses (slurred) it is great to have all of you back and i hope my hometown was very kind to all of you i do miss it and perhaps when all this is said and done and i can get a proper-- maybe a writ of approval from you folks here at whitestone maybe they can absolve me of a couple of things on the books i would like to say goodbye to (slurred) i can't understand what i'm saying where did you get this (slurred) it's pretty great (slurred) you have to have some it's not very tasty i'll tell you that but let me tell you what it will do is this all right do you down the shot pike make a constitution saving throw go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw pike 15 pike downs it it burns in her stomach and she takes it all right make another saving throw pike so pike takes the second shot slams the drink down on the table you feel the numbness hit your lips pike and you feel a little strange a little sparkly and numb for a second your tongue isn't quite functioning as you would hope as everyone's looking towards you (slurred) a second shot that is obviously very brave of you pike and with that pike faceplants onto the ground and passes the fuck out (laughter) she's limp in your grasp man she's snoring loudly too (slurred) i think this is an important lesson for all of us-- at least the two of us-- no more of that (slurred) you should have prefaced that before we had a drink (slurred) it's fine too late now she's slumped over (laughter) (slurred) look scanlan i've known you long enough to know that you are a master of tall tales (slurred) i honestly don't even know if you're real right now i am so fucked up on this (slurred) you're telling me that you've made friends with j'mon sa ord (slurred) then please do (laughter) (slurred) if it is within my ability as your employee of course (slurred) depending maybe (slurred) what (slurred) i understand that i don't really deal with these things (slurred) not here in whitestone (slurred) look if you want to get some suude go down to the turst fields or maybe over in kymal (slurred) the turst fields south of the alabaster sierras (slurred) looking for drugs yes (slurred) get some suude (slurred) suude (slurred) s-u-u-d-e suude (slurred) yeah suude (laughter) (slurred) no it's a drug (laughter) (slurred) you confuse me gnome (slurred) look as your employee this is a very uncomfortable conversation to have (slurred) i can send a courier maybe but that's very highly illegal stuff mind you to be fair the prison where they put you is currently being sat on by a giant red dragon so if there was a time to buy this would be it (slurred) look i'm in charge of well that and you look over kynan's face-down on the table trashed (slurred) in charge of that now apparently still training along with kash a bunch of people i cannot do this myself it would not behoove our current state here in whitestone i could ask around maybe send somebody it'll be a while i can't get you suude here in whitestone all right (slurred) thanks (laughter) (slurred) now you're just making fun of me (slurred) i'll go and get you some suude you're welcome (slurred) that's all i want be pleased (laughter) eventually jarett (slurred) all right i need to sleep this off whatever this is good night everyone see you in the morning he stumbles his way out the door frame into the whitestone night anything else you guys wish to accomplish tonight or are you going to go ahead and get some sleep just read it out loud at that point you're still out you're done for the night (laughter) 12 you're passed out you don't hear anything make a dexterity check vax 24 the stack is beautifully balanced it's rotating a little bit as he's admiring it you get a sudden push forward and clacking all the trays and glasses fall and hit the ground you hear the metal and the brass (clanging) pike stirs you wake up still trashed pike and your lips numb as ever but you're back to consciousness now hearing all this clattering around you the older woman over in the corner who owns the bar is like it's fine she watches it hit the ground and goes thanks all right you guys find your way back to whitestone castle to your respective rooms okay make a stealth check 29 yeah no percy does not seem to notice you he's snoring loudly face down in his still-set bed (snoring) in the bed itself the room is dark but you can still see fine yeah go ahead and make a sleight of hand check 22 percival i need you to roll a perception check with disadvantage you are in the sleep of the dead right now so you're rolling with disadvantage and whatever you roll minus four yes a couple moments of snoring and you stop and you wait for the breathing to continue and you find the coat pocket where you found it gently slip the letter in with the notes that you found it with close it step away okay you gently close the door no issue all right as you guys go to rest for the evening sleep takes you eventually some of you longer than others because you woke up not too long before sunrise comes in castle whitestone once again the previously somewhat cloudy day is now a very gray sky day there is a slight mist in the air looking out over the forest from the windows you can see that the forest itself has a very thick low fog and mist that does cover portions of it it's a cold cold morning and it's a brisk way to wake up as you guys all begin to come down to eat your meal for the morning as the guards go about business within the castle seeker asum comes into the room with you guys and goes i am sorry to intrude there is some new information while you were gone that i would like to discuss with you when you finish eating we'll meet in the war room i'll be waiting for you he leaves looking a little spooked okay you guys finish your meal as fast as you can you head up and meet in the war room no this is actually a meeting room in the castle that has been converted into a war room for planning and such this is where you met with cassandra and allura and people in the past to discuss about important matters you come into the room there's the big window facing out across whitestone on the second floor for this room there's the table in the center and asum is sitting there fingers steepled looking at the table thank you please come in close the door behind you i think we should have some privacy for this this is an important conversation i'd prefer to have it here in private asum stands up for a second and goes thank you for coming i think it's time we discuss something of extreme importance go for it insight checks asum stands up hands on the table i assure you this room is safe it's going to be a brief discussion before i continue hear my words think before you act i implore you understand that not all is what it seems and i come to you as an ally asum's eyes flash a vibrant green for a second and then become yellowish reptilian orbs you see a hint of green scales curl across the face now please let us talk violence will not end in your favor you have no plan no trap i am smarter more prepared and more powerful than all of you i know of whitestone i know your tricks and i know your weaknesses if i wished you destroyed right now i could have done it a thousandfold already so consider the fact that we're even having this conversation is me putting forth a lot of effort and intent to have this discussion no rash actions now let us put our cards on the table shall we i as i'm sure you've noticed am raishan it is a pleasure to meet you in person slayers of the hope devourer and the iron storm i need your help i wish to kill the cinder king and that's where we'll end tonight's session (screaming) and on time 1005 there were a few holes in asum's story when he first got here nobody picked up on yeah the whole time since he arrived in whitestone yeah there is no teleportation sigil to whitestone that's why you guys had to travel there on foot liam and if you wish to you can well i guess we'll find out in the future maybe we'll find out in the future thanks loot crate you guys are awesome thank you ashley for coming you're amazing apparently a lot of you guys came tonight to watch the show thank you so much for coming and watching he's been planning that for a couple of months with me
