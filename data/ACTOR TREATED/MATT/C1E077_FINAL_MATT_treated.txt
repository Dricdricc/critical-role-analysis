then on that note unless anyone else has anything to say we are going to dive into tonight's episode of critical role [dramatic music] so picking up where we left off last time the group of intrepid adventurers known as vox machina have been making their way through their quest to take down the chroma conclave a group of chromatic dragons who have been terrorizing the countryside in tal'dorei under the rule of thordak the cinder king a great powerful and seemingly elementally charged ancient red dragon who sits in the center of the city of emon after gathering the rest of the artifacts you guys have been seeking called the vestiges of divergence the last one being found in the city of brass upon the fire elemental plane you traveled back to fort daxio a northern fort north of emon where you were planning a trap of some kind for thordak upon arriving with two charges of yours two previously enslaved celestial-blooded boys that you found in the city of brass you all traveled across the planes with the help of keyleth back to fort daxio to find the landscape scarred with recent flame and apparently a battle raging at the outer gate that is where we left off so you guys looking northward you can see the large plumes of black smoke billowing up from the direction of the fort the outer wall seems to have sustained some damage you can see a number of flying entities swooping in dozens of them while you can hear the distant sound of combat shouts and battle you guys as you land and realize this you can see the two slaves who have now been freed and taken with you both look immediately wide eyed and freaked out and closed off what are you guys doing okay so you fly up and head up over the front wall right so you fly up and get a vantage point to see what's going on over the wall as you crest up in the air you notice that there are a number of soldiers currently battling possibly a hundred or more lizard men that have swarmed into the fort as well as a number of-- and go ahead and make a perception check actually to see if you can make some good detailed elements out 27 all right these are wyvern riders this is a group of wyvern riders with lizard men that have swooped in you can see a number of the siege elements that have been built by percy over there some have been firing off on the inside or at least ones that were installed in the actual fort base you also see a distant explosion a flash of light on one of the walls on the inside there is the outer wall and there is a courtyard in the actual fortress itself the front gates to the inner courtyard have already been breached and most of the battle is happening inside the main courtyard as you're noticing this you watch as two wyverns are now swooping in your direction from the outside of the outer wall you guys are far south probably a good quarter-mile south of the fort on the outside of the wall you can wait until they're close enough they're a little bit out of your range right now you know what as of right now you could probably hit one of them with bad news what's the long range on it okay you bear down and you-- yeah go for it and laura you still have to wait at this point you're readying your shot okay aiming for-- it's okay you're currently selecting a wyvern or the rider to fire at the explosion from the front of the muzzle of bad news fires off the spark and flame and smoke billowing forth the shot has no impact it looks like from gauging at this distance it was just outside of the range it's hard to gauge really at that distance whether or not they were there but apparently the bullet lost momentum by the time it reached their position they nod and they take the stone and they start running off towards the western edge of this valley which has the two cliffsides that come into the valley here a lot of the nearby brush appears to have been burned on the way they go darting off keeping low and you get the sense that they're used to fleeing so they dart off arm in arm rushing off towards the side of the valley wall you have time to reload before they get close enough for her to fire so if you want to take another shot okay so you guys are all charging towards the outer gate what are you doing vex you watch the rest of your party darting-- currently you do not see any dragons at the-- yes there is no cover there you go as you guys are charging towards the blown-open gates to the outer courtyard of fort daxio with vex swooping down on her broom with the bow out you watch as these wyvern riders come swooping down in your direction their claws extended their tails and stingers out forward they come swooping down go ahead and take a shot you can take a shot as well yes hunter's mark there's two and a third one has joined a little behind now they're coming upon you which one do you hunter's mark hard to gauge at this distance okay there you go i believe looking at the specifics there-- technically-- they know you're around this is less like they haven't acted yet they've been acting every round they've been dashing toward you so you do not have the drop on them as they've been making a beeline since the beginning apologies okay i want you and percy to both roll damage on those attacks as these are both guided at the same individual no you would not unfortunately okay so as you hear the explosion at the front of the muzzle of bad news take off the arrow whizzing through the air both impacting into each side of the wyvern you watch as one of its wings tears open it tumbles forward the rider thrown off its back and clutching onto its reins flipping over the side as it corkscrews and slams into the ground about 150 200 feet behind you skidding across the dirt go for it okay effectively slammed and left behind in the dust right now it's going to have to get up and rush to try and catch up to you guys the other two are swooping down now and have managed to get up-- you do get your second attack yes you could as well for your round hits yeah actually at this point they're maybe 150 feet from you no at a higher level trinket's cool like that and the save what's the dc again you have to write down your dc man there you go this one now as you guys both-- you pull back and release your second arrow and you take bad news reload it and then fire again-- you watch as this time one of the wings breaks at the hinge it folds under itself the rider this time as opposed to holding on is thrown and plummets the rest of the distance hitting the ground with a very heavy (splat) against the stonework his head scattering the wyvern ends up slamming into the ground and skidding off into a big cloud of dust behind you as well as you guys continue pushing forward however that does complete your round the last one does swoop down and is going to-- you're making the loudest noise and got the most attention so it's going to swoop in your direction percival it's going to come on down it's going to make two attacks on you and then harry and lift up that's with its bite that's going to be a miss it goes to snatch at you with its bite and you duck out of the way however the stinger comes up from behind that is a 19 to hit just barely hits okay as the stinger slams into your shoulder that is ten points of piercing damage i need you to make a constitution saving throw okay to take that saving throw again go for it it's whatever you rolled the second time i think let me double check just a moment all right so this is your indomitable not resolve your indomitable you must use the new roll a 12 no all right so as the poison courses through your body the stinger itself pulling forth you see a bit of black-greenish liquid spill out as it pulls itself out of the wound you suffer 24 points of poison damage as it then lifts back up out of range and is going to circle around you guys all still running you see percy get hit you can now because it was coming very close before you had the opportunity to hit it swings up past and you can now reaching behind get a fireball wand shot if you want at this point now as it swooped past it's about 40 45 feet away a safe enough distance for the fireball to not blow up his own party that is a no it rolled a three so go ahead and roll damage you should have said that at the beginning it's a basic 8d6 you got it and what are you doing vax liam if i can attack i'm throwing daggers okay both hit yeah as it swoops past nah you've already confirmed it correct you have one point of exhaustion which means that your ability checks are at disadvantage keyleth grog do you guys want to do anything while it passes overhead it was a burning pain through your body but it subsided after the original poison coursed through your body so you fought it off sufficiently afterward okay you guys keep running grog yeah that's 200 feet behind you you guys have been running this whole time as it went overhead and crashed into the ground behind you okay you guys just keep running okay so as you guys continue to run forward it swings around after the fireball detonates and you see it wobble in the air for a second 33 points the rider has turned to ash blown off the top of it the wyvern however has still found its target and turns around and on its own is swooping back towards the group of you guys you're now about halfway towards the front gate of the keep of fort daxio you guys both percy and vex with ranged weapons you can take your shot now as it's turning around and returning to you guys still charging forward all right so you move your hunter's mark over to that guy go for it that hits all right 23 damage nice all righty yes second one right so there's five plus three for this and it's plus eight damage-- oh to hit okay both hit i was like that's really high damage for arrows my apologies 13 damage so running forward you turn around behind over your shoulder you switch your actual direction of arrows you normally fire with and turn the other way both arrows sink into it and you see it wobble in the air percy hits you can if you want to 26 hits all three hit go ahead and roll damage not on one hit that's all of his attacks nice all righty so all three shots pelt it in the chest you can see giant sections of its meaty chest blown open and it's streaking dark wyvern blood behind it however it's still flying the fervor on its face as it's near death is causing it to get more intense as it swoops down toward you streaking out the tail ends up curling beneath it's going to take a shot toward you percy as you were the one that most recently hit it and did the most damage with the bite that is a 24 to hit and the stinger is at only a 13 to hit so the stinger seeing it coming this way you duck out of the way however its giant wyvern jaws clamp down and streak across your shoulder as the momentum pulls it past dragging it across the back for that you suffer ten points of piercing damage as it comes down at that point it's back in range for any of you melee folk that want to take a swing at it grog yes you can yes i'm keeping tabs because this is more of a flyby as you guys are running sure yeah a lot of these are happening simultaneously that hits go ahead and roll damage okay as it swoops down and bites into percy's arm as it drags up in the air you watch as a very fast-running grog who's been ahead of the group at this point his speed is higher than anybody spins around axe in the air and carves right through the front of its chest to its back it (screeching) and slides into two pieces that then scatter into the ground smearing black darkness across the dry desert floor you guys continue to run forward currently all your harrying wyverns are way too far behind and damaged or not paying attention before you guys are just now reaching the outside of the busted fort daxio outer wall where the front gates are collapsed inward and slightly burned you guys all go into the front gates okay you come up over the top of the wall as you get up over the top immediately you see they have two large ballistae the number of ballistae installed throughout the walls here two of them have already been torn apart and whoever was manning them is lying on the ground torn open and dead but you do also see other dead lizardmen it looks like a fight has been going on for a short time here and has been a back and forth as you guys come into the main courtyard you find the ground is charred with small flames that are still burning on bushes and elements of piles of broken wood and things that were part of the encampment that just caught fire you can see groups of lizardmen battling various soldiers some of them still screaming and the sound of lizard-like battle cries as they charge in slamming weapon against weapon shield against face this is an actual small-scale war happening inside here it's hard to tell which side is winning a lot of the soldiers are better-trained but occasionally you watch as a wyvern swoops down and picks up a soldier and throws them off the side and slams into the ground no longer moving perception check disadvantage for you buddy okay so the two of you as soon as you dart inside and glance over you can see nobody that catches your familiar eye everyone who is in armor is in full armor they're all in the actual fort daxio defense regalia and they are covered in blood they're covered in soot and they are not paying attention to you because they are fighting for their lives right now you can see there are a number of tents to the side dried trees that have burnt out entirely you can see a number of the trebuchets that you have repaired earlier that have already torn down or at least have suffered partial damage from fire or other elements bludgeoning no it looks like when this began currently only daxio's army was here and is here currently yeah you do watch and see as currently there is no tension toward you because the battles happening right now are still happening you see multiple soldiers gathering around wyverns that have been dragged to the ground with chain or have nets thrown over them and soldiers are gashing running up and slashing and stabbing as they can while the lizardman carves its way through and takes its spear and starts piercing out with its shield as you look around nothing but insanity going around what are you guys doing it's all mixed in right now it's a free-for-all there's no group of lizardmen sitting around and waiting out for a target there are a number of wyverns scattered that are currently swooping down and being part of the chaos currently not engaged on the ground i'd say about seven yeah totally okay there are masses of lizardmen in this area that are in the middle of the fray as soon as you guys storm in and start making noise making your presence know a number of them who are waiting for a way to pierce in and get their weapons into the last of these soldiers that are fighting off as best they can the last stand they have here at the outside of fort daxio some of them turn over their shoulders and see you and start rushing in you guys with ranged weapons you go first go ahead and roll attacks on this the wyverns have not seen you actually make a stealth check just to make sure you've made your way in carefully they're not paying attention to you but they may or may not see you out of their peripheral okay yeah the one you're aiming at has not seen you 33 hits 28 hits okay what was that the first one 31 nice that hits 25 damage great so that one you're aiming at had already taken some damage in the battle its rider had already been torn off of it and it's basically on automatic tear-and-destroy mode both of your arrows-- one finds the side of its throat as it whips its head around to look at the direction it came with this one finds the eye at front of its snout sinks in and it slowly limply falls out in the air and smashes into the ground maybe 25 feet to your right okay cool you're aiming at the same one as her you guys (impact) this poor wyvern gets torn asunder (laughs) poor travis' ass you watch as a number of these lizardmen six to be exact all start rushing in towards you guys as they were firing at the wyvern in the air what are you guys doing at this point you just have a wave of them coming at you right now yeah you guys are still clustered together six they're just charging straight at you some have swords shields and spears like (snarling) as they're charging in you watch the staff slam into the ground as it slams into the ground you can see at the very tip there's a small piece of crystalline energy that begins to go from a dull greenish-blue to a bright red and as it hits the apex of its glow a single beam of red energy streaks forward towards them as they're all charging what's the dc on that well it's whatever her spell dc is when she cast it and no none of them make it so go ahead and roll the damage on that yep it's an ability of the spire 25 points of damage 30 points of fire damage as the chaos is still happening you watch as another blast of flame explodes on the top tower that is the front of the fortress itself and you hear what sounds like dual wilhelm screams as two guys who were situated on the top running to of the ballista get blown off and both slam into the ground faces and necks snapped from the impact on the floor looking up in that direction you watch as another streak of bluish-green arcane energy shoots up a few hundred feet into the sky and it (poof) as a sort of signal for them you look up top as you see one wyvern is curling its way perched up on the edge of it and there jumping onto its back you see an elf an elf with longish blonde hair robes that are bloodied it gets up and holds onto the reins at this point he's probably about 80 feet from you you guys are halfway across the courtyard to the actual fortress if you want to get close so yes you could about 45 feet up shoot him okay for the purposes of this guys we're going to go ahead and roll initiative well you don't know if he's a bad guy or not but he's on the battlefield pike has been having a hard time keeping up with everyone with her tiny short legs forgot to mention the new gm tips episode is out this week talking about how to deal with player character deaths (laughter) oh my god sam sam no one should ever say i want to cut a hole in the mouth of a picture of you i do want to say that is pretty much life-size which is really creepy with you guys on the battlefield let's roll initiative (sing-song) sorry you guys 25 to 20 nice 20 to 15 i need someone to roll for pike by the way i think it's plus one so add that-- nine all right so 15 to ten grog what did you get top of the round as you see this figure get onto the wyvern up top bloodied grabbing on to the reins looking over the top vex you're up first okay 20 hits 16 damage and dc of 16 is it strength no that's a 15 does he take additional damage from the bramble shot 16 total from the shot okay it's your normal arrow damage plus whatever it tells you to roll on that it's your arrow damage and then that on top of it at this point he's-- he did not see you so yes gotcha as you reach out and fire the arrow you watch him glance over the wall his eyes go wide as the arrow (impact) pierces his chest and sprouts into 20 to 25 tiny bramble-like vines that wrap around him and wrap around his body as he gets pushed back and falls off the back of the wyvern out of sight make a perception check okay as you see his expression as he falls back it jogs your memory a little bit you do recognize him this is gatekeeper xanthas he was the gatekeeper at the traverse junction in the emon alabaster lyceum the place that had the teleportation circles the guy who was always at the desk waiting for you every time he was annoyed with you xanthas gatekeeper xanthas you watch him just get thrown off the back of the wyvern slammed past out of sight so at full speed on your broom broom speed is what again it should be on the broom i'm sure it does have one i'll look it up right now but you need to keep in mind what your movement is on your broom it's like ten flying speed 50 feet as you rush in on the broom and look over the wyvern still has its claws up on the edge of the walls (snarls) looking around you can see it's taken a few hits a few arrows sticking out of it however from the explosion that happened the two ballistae up there don't appear to be damaged but you have no current view of xanthas so that ending your turn that brings us to vax that rock it's about maybe 40 feet up here probably about 30 feet tall no not in that rock no it's a piece of stone that's sticking out okay keyleth currently nothere are a number of the wyvern riders and-- going to place these guys over here so i go and do that-- you do see lizardmen off to the side that are in the middle of a struggle a soldier over there and a number of lizardmen that are currently bashing at the front gates trying to get through the main door into the-- you have three that are on the ground right now that have nets thrown over them or chains pulled across holding them down and there are a number that are high up in the air right now circling looking for a way to swoop down and grab somebody a few have their eyes on vex they're maybe 40 feet apart right now at the least from the closest one to you about 80 feet there are currently six pushed against it and there are a few that are moving off in this direction to go join them yeah they're currently slamming into the door and hitting it and trying to find their way through okay from what you can tell and what you remember the gate itself is mostly stone and iron all right so keep track of the charges you're using they all fail yeah they all fail rolling nothing tonight 31 (explosion) this one seed of arcane red energy that shoots forth from the staff slams into the door and you watch as they're all thrown backwards screaming through the air the blast incinerating their bodies and scattering them to the four winds all of those there yeah you see groups of wyvern riders that are currently fighting off the guards keyleth do you want to move or are you staying there that's up to you all right i'm asking if you'd-- vax stayed there up to you yeah you are staying here all right ends keyleth's turn percival what are you doing okay tinkering check all right you get the gun to function it's not your turn scanlan right here the wyvern or the rider correct it's thrashing about cool so that finishes your round then percy scanlan now it's your turn you're rushing forward on your tiny gnome feet arm out in front release a bolt of energy that slams into the front of the edge of the tower itself and as you coast it upward it burns a dark spot across the stonework before slamming into the wyvern itself the wyvern tries to dodge out of the way what is the dc on that that's true (sings) that's true (speaking) no it does not succeed it has no dex bonus so it's a straight 15 (explosion) it hits the wyvern who's already taken a few blows it shrieks back looks down its eyes zeroed in on you its wings out looks like it's about to go into a jumping dive okay you do and take your d12 inspiration die all righty and with that ending your turn the wyvern up at the top swoops down right up to you scanlan mouth open stinger out to the side okay well its bite goes to strike you and i can almost guarantee you it misses with a 14 the stinger however (whoosh) that's true you didn't-- all right so so it's 14 that does hit you exactly yeah go for it so go ahead and-- eight okay the bite goes to clamp down and as you-- the wyvern pulls back its head confused and the jaw snaps shut as it rears its wings out strangely its tail comes back angrily how many bardic inspiration die have you spent since your last battle by the way right cutting words also uses a bardic inspiration i believe-- i believe let me check yeah you have to use your bardic inspiration dice so that's five you get as many as your wisdom modifier-- i'm sorry your charisma modifier one more so the stinger comes swooping down towards you and that is a nine it rolled a two the tail whips past your head no impact pike's turn pike rushing forward as (panting) looking around who here looks pretty rough if anybody well she can only get up to you right now keyleth at the moment because of her stumpy legs fucking stumpy (laughter) two eights and a five this is 16 21 plus five you heal 26 hit points that was a really good healing roll for a level three all righty that ends pike's turn grog you're up go for it he's not frenzied yet that hits okay second strike you want to do it as you rush and slam the axe into its side it buries a good three inches into the chest and as it's pulled back its tail is still recoiling from the attack on scanlan looks back to you and you see its attention's geared on you but it's pretty rough okay go for it okay 28 as you pull the axe out this time as it's rearing back and looking angrily at you you chuckle to yourself as you throw the axe up in the air it spins once and you catch it and you jam it right in the center of its skull it goes from rearing angrily to lights out and it hits the ground instantaneously collapsing into a heap as you wedge the blade out from the center of its forehead you still have about 20 feet of movement by the way that side yeah so you now have ten temporary hit points on top of what you had all right so that ends your turn grog that's the end of the round that's right you held to wait until everybody else has a go okay so you-- go ahead and roll an attack roll 26 okay as the dagger whips up past you you look down and see the thrown dagger do you want to try and catch it okay go ahead and make a dexterity check no unfortunately you reach out and catch the blade and it cuts across your hand a little bit which at that point if you want to-- as your turn to travel with it it's the damage that needs to happen it's the impact so you do take four points of piercing damage as you try and catch it from the front of the blade in your hand and the speed at which it's thrown is-- you feel the impact-- at which point the blade all of a sudden swirls with dark shadow energy and your brother appears at your side all righty your movement is now on the broom reduced to 20 feet with two people on it at which point you see the wyverns and the riders start thrashing about some of them have spears that're jamming out from the middle of the net you watch as this guy spins around and takes out three out of the guards that all just collapse to the ground one takes a stinger to the face another one gets bitten and has its head broken in the process while a third one gets a spear to the front of the chest over here yeah he's hurt but he's been taking out a lot of the guards along the way the rest of these lizard guards do a full double dash this way past that guard there who's giving chase these guys all rush up to try and make their way to the front door again they can't really do anything yet to the door but they can get there at this point in time-- vex vax from your vantage point up at the top on the broom you hear this distant echoing horn sound this (low horn noise) it's echoing through the valley you glance over your shoulder and you see a bead of burning red light making its way in your direction wings flapping it's closer than you think and as it comes closer and closer towards you-- you feel the blood rush from your face as your immediate instinct is oh god the cinder king is here while there are flames involved the size is not as immense as you would expect from thordak instead what you see is a large red winged bird with flames trailing off the edges of its wings flapping in your direction coming over the wall on the outside of the fortress on its back you see a humanoid but much larger than anyone of your size armored with dark black and grayish-silver-trimmed iron armor a giant maul in one hand itself reddish flame-like hair this is a fire giant similar to the ones you encountered in the city of brass riding on the back of this ember-roc-type creature as it comes cruising over the top you hear it holding a horn in its other hand start shouting out the cinder king calls for swift execution i deliver his hate with absolute strength and it swoops into a dive toward the front side of the gate at a full speed at this point it coasts right beneath both of you swinging the hammer in the air i need both of you guys to make dexterity saving throws no well evasion is against any spell let me check quick (laughs) you do not get advantage for anything but i admire you checking for any given possibility what'd you roll 16 okay so you manage to lift up onto the broom almost doing a complete handstand to get out of the way however the bottom of it catches your sister in the side of her leg causes the broom to lurch and begin to lose control of it you both manage to hold on to the broom but you from the impact of the hammer do suffer 16 points of bludgeoning damage as the bird now in a full dive slams in a giant fiery crash into the front two gates of the keep it swooped right underneath you no because you were trying to get out of the way to do that you would have been fully off the broom and you would fall as it (swoosh) into this full dive slams into the two front gates which explode into a cloud of dust broken rock masonry and iron you watch as the dust settles briefly now the giant is stepping off of the back of this giant flaming bird and looks around clutching its hammer in its hand actually yeah as the dust clears the lizard men that were at the gate were all destroyed in the impact crushed their bones broken and you can see one arm twitching out of the center of the rubble the doors are currently blown open and off the hinges there all righty and then-- fresh off the airplane that is awesome i want a shirt that says that fuck it der-n-der indeed all righty so bringing us to the top as they both stand there the flames still emanating out from the impact the lizardmen scattered and broken at the gate the battle still waging on in the vicinity you see as two other battles over here the wyvern rider on this wyvern is stabbed in the head and is killed the wyvern is still around but it takes another guard out behind it over here this guy continues to fight and takes out two of the guards but there is still one behind that is holding strong top of the round vex what do you want to do as you just barely gather control over the broom again over here yeah you can okay so you both make your way over landing on the roof there you can see xanthas is still bound by the vines his eyes wide he's like what are you doing release me okay so getting right up to the edge arrow off to the side go for it 21 on the first one hits technically he went past you saw you impacted you with him-- or she did sorry-- it is well aware where you went and knows that you-- there's no sneak attack i'm sorry you'd have to hide somewhere to try and get sneak attack correct which you used to move your hunter's mark vax you're up on deck 18 plus four nice go for it one arrow-- sure that hits go for it all righty both arrows (impact) one slams into the armor and sticks into it about three or four inches and you can see the giant female fire giant glances at her shoulder angrily and looks up over the top at you at the full movement it would've taken you to get there with your brother on your back that's as far as you can get you're crouching but you're not hiding you do have some cover because of the edge of the wall she sees you but you have a little bit of cover vax you're up the giant may or may not be you currently have to get over to the edge to see it that's from being a vengeance paladin all right go for it 22 hits okay no sneak attack on this did you roll your hunter's mark on that you just used it okay as you back up into that doorway she swings around the giant maul arcing in your direction a great maul actually specifically that is 24 to hit okay in order to take half damage all righty so that comes to-- oof this is going to be fun for you all righty let's get the dice out for this oh i have the wrong dice there we go you take 31 bludgeoning damage halved to 15 it-- whack-- slams you into the shoulder you dodge out of the way and the momentum actually hits you and the inertia shoves you into the side of the doorway you catch yourself all right that ends your turn keyleth you're up so you're trying to do it this way all right so it comes bursting through all right they both need to make a dexterity saving throw against a dc 19 correct that is a 17 for the giant no and that is a seven for the roc so no they both take 4d8 bludgeoning damage it is the creature's nature-- they both fall prone but the nature of their flames is natural it is part of their actual physicality so the flames do not get extinguished no but the water does slam into the bird you see steam rise up as it impacts the flames darken a little bit and subside briefly both of them are knocked off their feet into the ground as you watch the tidal wave curl up slam into both of them and then spill out and spread across the ground putting out this fire here actually yep great that finishes your turn keyleth or do you want to move okay that brings us to the general as she stands at half of her movement there she extremely angry gets up (growls) oh that's not playing fair looks back at a piece of the rubble grabs it-- actually is going to use her flaming anger which is an ability she has she gets extremely furious and tenses up you can see muscles bulging in her forehead she grabs a big chunk of the nearby rubble you watch as the rubble already on fire from the impact the fiery impact of the site begins to heat up lobs it at you that is a natural one as it goes whoosh and tumbles past-- yeah it goes off and actually impacts one of the wyverns flying through the sky and hits it it goes down over the outer wall using her flaming anger however she angrily grabs another piece this one even larger both hands over the head the great maul hanging at her side and throws it at you this time that is a 19 to hit okay you suffer 33 points of bludgeoning damage from the impact plus ten points of fire damage from the heat as it slams into you almost knocking you onto your back you manage to catch yourself but the pieces of it hit you and then break apart and fall to the ground around you you find your whole front side charred from the impact with the rest of her movement is going to-- let's see she only has 20 feet one two three four in your direction picking her great maul up with her hand and swinging it thank you boyfriend glasses delivery ends the general's turn percy you're up scanlan you're on deck they're not currently harrying you no they're fighting off guards possibly if they kill the guards he is but two of the guys who were holding the net have died off so it's almost negligible at this point he can't get the wings going but if the net is removed or he manages to get the net off it'll be fine in a terrible round for percy as you walk forward in the center you turn to the side fire at the wyvern get one shot that immediately locks up you feel the reeling feedback psychic feedback from animus course through you you put it away pull out bad news take aim as you fire that horrible silent click sound as you pull back you hold it away from you just in time as the flame backs up in the butt end of the weapon just flares outward you can see this is going to need a little work to get it working again you want to move or anything else you want to do on your turn right there that is a crate and a chest oh this right here you mean oh that is one of the trebuchets that you had repaired and one of the ones that isn't damaged yet there you go it is loaded it has not been used it looks like the men that were currently fighting the wyvern across the way had loaded it up and then were assaulted when they threw the net over so it currently is ready for use it is a difficult thing to aim that ends percy's turn scanlan you're up okay 7th-level bigby's hand the giant yes it is with your hand cone all righty so bigby's hand appears goes into a clenched fist go ahead and make a spell attack correct 21 hits and so it's cast at seventh level oh vax i also need you to make a constitution saving roll 40 ooh you have a concentration check for your hunter's mark okay go ahead no-- constitution yeah okay you maintain concentration you're fine all right so as you conjure bigby's hand you see the purple energy trail off your fingers and as your bring your hand back into an uppercut motion you watch as the air in front of the giant and she begins stomping forward in the direction of keyleth and pike the energy forms into this giant purple fist of smoke that just sucker-punches her right in the gut she looks down confused and angry at this fist that turns into a middle finger immediately (laughter) you've moved ten feet that way you still have-- you have looks to be pike keyleth and grog all within range second level all righty there you go that ends scanlan's turn all right so vex i need you to make a wisdom saving throw if you could it's a seven as you looking off the side getting your arrows ready for a second round you can hear a couple of whispers off to your side as you glance over you make eye contact with xanthas who has managed to shrug off the bramble vines around his body as soon as he finishes talking he points a finger towards you and you're listening you snap to attention and he goes why don't you take a walk off the edge of that tower right there you're still intelligent oh yeah so he's a-- just double-checking to make sure i could make him do this it doesn't say that you can't each time it takes damage it gets to retake the saving throw okay okay yeah so you come up and you go off the edge and you have the broom there all right and you're coasting there with your broom and he darts down the stairs into the building and as he's rushing off he's like all right shoot your friends (laughter) so now it is pike's turn not without you couldn't you could but it would take your whole turn all right you get over there at the trebuchet i'll allow it pike okay by the way you used one earlier so you have one more 3rd-level spell slot after this before you got here just so you know grog you're on deck by the way sure if they are prone with melee attacks in the vicinity no it has advantage if you're within five feet of it all right at what level are you casting this you've already used your 3rd-level-- 4th-level spell so you have to use your 2nd-level okay you have an extra one then but do keep in mind you've already cast a 3rd-level spell this round-- a 4th-level spell so if you're doing a bonus action it can only be 2nd-level or lower so it would be at 2nd-level sure why not (laughter) that would be messy okay all right that ends your turn pike all right grog go for it yes correct 22 hits hits hits all three hit nice okay 30 all right that's 64 points of damage in one round against the creature as you rush in and start whaling on it you almost don't notice the proximity of it the heat is so hot that you suffer ten points of fire damage just being that close to it your skin starts to burn and the edges of your beard begins to singe and curl in correct all right that ends your turn all right with that it goes to the large ember-roc's turn all righty it's going to go ahead and use an action to attempt its inferno its inferno it begins to beat its wings extremely heavily and as it does the heated air and the flames begin to billow up from around it i need you to make a dexterity saving throw grog you do all right oh that's-- good thing too that was six six five four on the d4 roll that was nice all right so that is 21 points of fire damage reduced to half so ten ten points of fire damage again and you are not blown back it's burning a little bit you're starting to smell the hair singeing it's making you angry even in your-- angrier a little bit yeah you're like oh god however you do not get pushed back and as it's taking off with its wings as part of the maneuver you do get an attack of opportunity at it if you want to take it 40 it doesn't get all way over to them it gets-- 21 hits go ahead and roll damage it swoops in the air as you smash your axe in the air towards-- (crash offscreen) like that (laughter) nice 23 and you smack it it shrieks in the impact but its wings still (whoosh) it arcs over and lands on the ground right behind pike and percy you guys feel the impact all right top of the round now this fellow over here who's now been loading up the ballista is going to go ahead and fire it at the bird that actually hits (cheering) that is 12 points of piercing damage all righty and over here during this fray this guy manages to destroy the last guard dispatch him and get the rest of the net off so that takes his full turn but now that is available over there these three guards one of them dies but in the process they do manage to hack down the rest of the wyverns the wyvern does die this wyvern does dispatch the last guard however and manages to take off its chain which is currently lodged into the back of the wyvern it pulls it forth from the wound with a spray of blood and now the wyvern is no longer bound so you now have two wyvern riders on the battlefield vex it's your turn you have to attack your friends at the end of your turn you do actually dominate person i don't think you do it's when you take damage let me see yeah that was your choice nope you are on your broom and you look down and the person who's closest to you of your friends is grog and so you're like well i've got to attack my friends make two shots against him 20 hits so go ahead and roll damage against grog with one arrow grog as you angrily finish slashing as the ember-roc flies overhead one arrow hits the ground next to you you're like what the hell and then you feel the pain right in the back of the neck as an arrow has embedded itself about two inches into your meaty goliath throat remember you don't halve the lightning damage it deals no because the lightning damage is different beyond the piercing so how much is-- okay so you take five plus four so you take nine points of damage total from that shot all right you're going to stand there for a moment and-- i mean you can move around if you want to you've just got to attack your friends when it comes to your action yeah it's an impulse it's like okay no worries okay that ends vex's turn vax this way three four five you can get within ten feet or you can get right up to it if you want to okay so you can get within ten feet of her okay okay well advantage because she's busy-- no you have advantage on attack rolls against the creature for one minute yeah well bigby's isn't threatening technically so it's-- that hits yeah was it a critical hit yeah you don't double the dice rogues man 42 nice 42 points of impact are you staying back i mean you threw whisper at it right i'm saying when you threw whisper you weren't travelling with it okay good just making sure that ends your turn vax keyleth you're up it's one giant bird and then angry wyverns that's a wyvern there and there's a wyvern over there i will fight you sam okay all righty so dexterity saving throw to that wyvern right there that is a six that is a very failed saving throw so that is-- correct ten points of lightning damage to it so to the wyvern right yeah so the wyvern rider barely pulls out of the way as the bolt of lightning from the slowly conjured storm in the sky strikes out and slams into the back of the wyvern you see the energy arcing through its body before it dissipates and the wyvern shakes from the impact looks around angrily the rider pulls the reins and gets it refocused it is every creature which the-- that's a natural one yes so they both get hit while he dodges the arcing energy actually travels through his body grounding himself to the creature so they both take damage perfect (laughter) you're ever-so-slightly levitating all right there you go keyleth all right now it's general (inaudible)'s turn i didn't you don't know it i said too much no that would be so hackneyed so after taking the blow to the chest is going to go straight for you grog you're a big old target who came forward and slammed and has dealt a crapton of damage probably as she turns with the floating hand and the floating sword waving it by the hammer watches as its ember-roc slams over towards percy and pike feels pretty confident sees you a little more of a heartier target points the hammer at you and says you will be my charge tonight and starts walking to you see if it recharges it does not recharge flaming anger unfortunately but will take two great maul attacks against you that is a 21 to hit and a 23 to hit all righty so you take for the first hit 40 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to half to 20 and the second strike not as good a roll i know 29 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to-- 14 so brings the hammer back right into your shoulder and it sends you off your feet you catch yourself from the impact of the blow as the hammer spins around and catches you in the other side right at the solar plexus almost knocking the wind out of you you feel your feet skid into the dry sand and dirt beneath your feet and a little smile curls in the corner of your face you've already used your reaction this round sorry but next turn i'm sure you'll be able to give her what for percival it's your turn as you're standing there the presence the heat of this creature near you you immediately suffer four points of fire damage just from being in the proximity of this entity more or less you'd probably have to rotate it a little bit there is a large crank that has to be rotated to shift its direction it is possible if you make a strength check to get it to move to its place right now so you're ignoring the bird for now and you're going for the trebuchet against the wyvern okay you don't know okay go for it that's saving throws it's only for saving throws not for ability checks what did you roll yeah you go and grab the ratchet and it's stuck it begins to shift a little bit you're not sure if it's going to line up okay you leap over and make your way inside the tent as you rush away the creature reaches out with one of its claws and rakes towards your back it's going to be a 20 to hit okay the claw streaks across your back you feel the pain and the sudden rush of adrenaline hit you at the impact that's going to be 14 points of slashing damage to your back yes you're inside the outer walls this is the actual front of the fort itself into the actual fortress itself yes correct yes percy you said you're taking your action surge second wind okay okay as you duck inside clear your mind for a second focus pull out your tools with your action surge and quickly find the one section of the barrel that had somehow sprung off and was loose you click it back into place look up it spins functional clear and fine that ends your turn (laughter) all right that brings us to scanlan you're up yes not a problem all right that will-- it might singe a bit of the fur on the side of your skivvies there grog but a bolt of lightning coasts right past you yeah fair enough this is a dexterity saving throw that is a 17 dex save that does not make the dc the giant gets full damage 24 okay so you release the bolt of lightning and then just as the lightning hits the front of the giant's chest as it was focusing on grog it looks over and sees where the lightning bolt came from just as the (whack) across the chin go ahead and roll a-- it maintains the level you cast it yeah well you have to roll to hit to see if you hit it first you watch as it swings towards the giant staring at you at the last minute glances out and she sees the fist and ducks back slow-motion passes past her chin as the jaw clenches the teeth grinding underneath you see the jagged broken tops of the giant teeth as the eyes (whoosh) right back to you i'm going to put bigby's hand on the other side now for that i almost want to give you inspiration for that sure take back your bardic inspiration for that sure scanlan you want to stay where you are or you going to move you still have ten more feet of movement if you want it all right there you go all right now darting from out from the side here xanthas runs out looks over the wall sees you floating above keep attacking your friends oh he's great well i mean-- you are considered charmed by him so yes yep seems like an ally at this point focusing on that keeping you informed-- okay is going to look down and points his finger across and a beam of reddish energy comes coursing to the ground and explodes right there in the center of this area actually right in the center with the fire elemental so i need grog scanlan and keyleth to all make dexterity saving throws this is a fireball correct okay that's full damage to keyleth and scanlan half damage to grog as this is a 5th-level fireball yeah little punk over here that was on top and went down inside and came out the other side xanthas yeah it's not concentration no 33 points of fire damage to scanlan 33 points of damage to keyleth in her elemental form and 15 points of fire damage to you grog and after firing he ducks down to the side and he doesn't do much 'cause he still has partial cover while he's behind the top of that wall right now that ends his turn pike you're up at the beginning of your turn due to the proximity of the heat of the bird behind you the giant ember-roc you would take eight points of fire damage but it's reduced to four because of your armor's fire resistance so that's four points of fire damage yes okay by the way your sword should have attacked last round when you summoned it so go ahead and make a spell attack with it just because i totally forgot about that just roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier you're up next grog that hits go ahead and roll the damage for your spiritual weapon that is 1d8 plus five all right so that's an additional eight points of damage to the giant okay so continuing your turn-- winch it all right so as you see percy run off you reach up go ahead and make a strength check 12 okay that's fine (cheering) okay as you pull the winch around and there's a little trigger underneath as you get it in place that's kind of holding it as pike (bink) the trebuchet the sudden momentum of the direct inertia to momentum the device spins over top and lobs this large boulder within this giant sling over and slamming right towards the face of the ember-roc that's an 18 go ahead and roll 4d12 damage it's a siege weapon man it's meant to destroy walls 27 points of bludgeoning damage to the ember-roc's face as it slams in the rock breaks across its skull and its head rears back from the impact and it stumbles back a bit shaking its head you can see part of its beak is cracked now from the impact blinking its eyes and shrieking no it's trying to kill your friends you can still move if you'd like and you have your bonus action to move your sword over if you'd like every round it lasts for a minute okay for the spiritual weapon just so you know-- well no it's not concentration but you can choose to use your bonus action to have the sword attack or cast a spell and the sword just does nothing okay so the bonus action is the sword toward the giant or the bird the sword swings out of the way arcs through the air roll another spell attack 16 does not hit okay if you want to yeah i mean you don't have to it's up to you okay so the blade arcs over and slams into the armor of the giant and the giant kind of shrugs it off no damage you just couldn't quite impact against the creature's flesh you still can move if you want to you're going to stay there okay the trebuchet is expended by the way it would have to be loaded and to load that thing it takes quite a few people just so you're aware it's probably not going to be useful again in this battle there are other weapons in the field heave ho all right pike that ends your turn okay that's about as far as you can get there staying in melee range of the creature or do you want to leave its melee range it will get a strike at you if you do actually it will not because it already stuck at percy so you can go there you're fine all right that ends your turn grog you're up go for it hits hits 41 points of damage on that one oh a straight 12 on that one oh that's nasty all right you still have your bonus action okay that hits 26 points of damage you did over 100 points of damage in one round of combat so with bigby's hand floating on one side and a glowing sword on the other the giant focusing on scanlan you get angry and just release this torrent of strikes pulling back from the blade you can see dark blood begin to pour from the plates and the giant is wounded but it's grinning and its attention swings back to you all right that ends your turn grog all right the bird who has watched pike run past after being slammed in the face by the trebuchet angrily steps forward here first let's see if it regenerates that it does recover its inferno ability however it is going to unleash a bite and two claw attacks on you that is a natural 20 on the bite that is a 19 to hit on the first claw attack and that is a 23 to hit so a bite and a claw attack the bite is a critical unfortunately so as that one comes to strike you that is 19 plus 2d8 fire damage so you take 30 points of slashing damage plus ten points of fire damage reduced to half so five actually it would have been 20 so that's ten points of fire damage right it would have been 20 is that fire damage you watch as there's a burst of flame but it seems to have no affect on the creature this creature is fire by nature possibly all right and it's going to begin flanking around you after it does its strikes it-- (stomps) that brings us to the top of the round now this guy is going to spend his turn loading up and then taking another shot at the bird there that one unfortunately goes wide it fires and slams into the ground and a big cloud of dust and rock gets thrown into the air as the large bolt jettisons into the floor wasted shot there this wyvern over here is going to fly up no he's going to go after keyleth the air elemental form there this wyvern here is going to rush over to scanlan and these guys are going to rush in and try and aid scanlan against this so we have the wyvern against you keyleth bite attack is a two no that is not going to hit the stinger is going to be an 18 to hit so you take 11 points of piercing damage are you immune to poison that's what i figured so you just take 11 points of piercing damage from that strike the other wyvern is going to swing down i forgot the wyvern rider is going to take an attack at you i forgot he's on there too he swings down with his giant club that's going to be a 21 to hit you suffer nine points of bludgeoning damage from the wyvern rider you scanlan the wyvern is going to strike at you with both its bite and its-- okay you can decide whether or not to cutting words i'm just giving you this because you've seen them fight the bite is painful the stinger is where the poison is save it for that one if you're going to but that was a 23 to hit and the stinger is a 21 okay 21 minus seven is 14 ooh yeah so you take 11 points of piercing damage for the bite and you take 11 points of piercing damage from the stinger and i need you to make a constitution saving throw yes 18 okay you manage to-- you take 12 points of poison damage correct and i need you to make constitution saving throws for each of those for your concentration you have advantage on these because of your warcaster feat yeah advantage on the-- you make two of them yeah yeah you're fine next one with advantage all righty and the wyvern rider is going to take a swing at you that is a 22 you take nine points of bludgeoning damage as it smacks you over the head with a giant club i need you to make another constitution saving throw with advantage because you're being hacked like crazy here there you go warcaster man warcaster is a great feat all right that ends their turn it is now vex's turn it's more of a telepathic thing you know what he's referring to you are such a lawyer no for this you're going to keep taking shots at grog yeah you get hit and the first one gets sneak attack damage because technically you're working on-- with the sneak attack okay so half of that it puts you at eight points of piercing damage so ten okay so 13 okay okay vax you're up okay okay go ahead and mark that on her sheet for her okay go ahead and roll damage on that yeah which is also doubled technically how do you want to do this (cheering) okay as you jam it into the back of the calf the armor plates give way to the impact of the blow and she looks over her shoulder and tries to swing the maul out backwards you're too low at this point as she pulls backwards exposes further up and you just drive the blade upward as you do you catch some sort of heavy vein as blood begins to just gout out of the wound and you keep pushing upward it won't go much past the thigh at this point but she turns around and starts going unconscious from the rapid blood loss based on the wounds she's already sustained she takes her hammer up to deliver a death blow down upon you and as she goes to reach for you her fingers lack the strength to hold the blade and she tumbles forward you pass to the side sidestepping as her form slams into the dirt knocking up dust around her on the ground (air horn) (laughter) 15 does not make it however technically and this was my fault before you do have advantage because it is a person who is not your ally or they're fighting your allies yep so you're still dominated sorry all right so that ends vax's turn keyleth you're up you do yes and the wyvern rider to the wyvern or the rider the wyvern the wyvern rider hasn't really been hurt okay go for it roll two strikes 18 hits 14 also hits they don't have a high armor class they've got a fair amount of hit points for their size but their armor class isn't huge okay gotcha all right okay go for it all righty so as you slam the wyvern twice whack whack you can see it's being buffeted the wings are trying to keep up from the sheer amount of wind that's swirling around it the blows are almost knocking the rider off and he's spent most of his round trying to hold on to it it's looking pretty rough it's barely keeping itself up in the air but it's still standing in front of you all right that ends your turn keyleth all right okay it is not the general's turn because the general is currently dead percival okay i will say that yes you can because they occupy the same space 19 hits so roll also for the-- also hits so with a single shot it shoots through the neck and actually pierces the shoulder of the rider at the same time roll damage once and it'll go for both of them okay so they both take a total of 14 points of damage it hits them both the rider is looking really messed up from the impact it looks like it hit something on the neck and is now bleeding onto its chest it looks a little dazed from the impact the wyvern is hurt wounded and the other guards are still stabbing at it with their weapons so it's not quite at death's door but it's looking pretty-- hits all right okay so roll damage and then they both take the next hit so 18 total this time as the wyvern rears up from the damage from the first impact the pain causing it to put its wings out and puff up it goes through the wing and takes out the temple of the rider the rider is immediately killed and falls off the back the wyvern is now in the process of trying to get its wings up it's realized how badly it's hurt and is going to attempt to flee again he's going to aim and the same mechanism-- you're having a reverse percy day wow there is balance all right that finishes percy's turn scanlan you're up just curled up and shaking yeah you didn't break concentration you can move it-- to you yeah you can get it to anything in the battlefield go ahead and roll 15 hits armor class is low on the wyverns okay the wyvern begins lifting up in the air trying to escape now it's sitting here whipping out the guards are backing up afraid to get too close you see scanlan concentrating as the wyvern gets about 15 feet off the ground bigby's hand swoops up grabs it and then plants it right onto the jagged rock behind it piercing it-- it weakly goes limp against the bladed rock that was your bonus action you still have your action and your movement if you like the two guards next to you are like we're at your aid sir action and movement yeah okay all righty so the wyvern makes a-- not with a two it doesn't and for the rider the rider does get a natural 20 so it does take half damage i'm trying not to it's a great exercise in focus i hate you so much with that the rider takes the impact of the lightning bolt and whips its head back around angrily however the wyvern beneath it gets blasted by the bolt of lightning and throws it back the rider gets just enough back and the wyvern falls to the ground unconscious and slowly dying okay so you move behind them guarding you right there you now have two bodyguards flanking you at that moment all right it is xanthas' turn now he sees the giant fall but the firebird is still in combat there's other wyverns floating around some being taken down in the distance from other guards it looks like the tide of battle is shifting now at this point you guys in helping out the guys around you both gave a morale boost and shifted the tide you can see the other wyverns the lizardmen have been for the most part dispatched within the courtyard around you however xanthas looking down and seeing the circumstance kind of uh um argh releases his hand this is going to be against you vax this is going to be a chain lighting that's a good call on that one all right chain lighting's a little bit of a bitch here let me pull it up there we go sixth level all right so i need vax grog and pike to all make dexterity saving throws okay both of you fail what did you get all three of you fail i know well that is 50 points five zero 50 points of lightning damage to pike vax and grog it's a 6th-level spell and he had a pretty damn high roll actually so yeah you take half that damage or take fire damage yeah it doesn't affect the creature you guys watch as the lightning streaks out from the top of the wall slams into the back of vax who-- you arc up your whole body seizing at the sudden burst of electrical energy which then bursts outward into grog and pike grog it hits you and your muscles tense and you drop the axe for a second you reach down and push through the pain and pick it back up pike it slams into you and you watch as the light shines up around you the smoke emanating from underneath the plate armor you fall to the ground there's a brief moment of silence and then suddenly this bright reddish-orange energy bursts out from beneath the armor through the neck through the sides of the plate and you lift up about three or four feet off the ground before landing back on the ground restored with a little bit of health this burst of flame arcs out around you xanthas then goes okay and darts back inside all right that brings us to pike so you're going to turn around to this giant angry ember-roc and guiding bolt it into the stomach all righty let's get over here for that assault at fifth level you said all righty that would be 8d6 radiant damage if you hit you make a ranged spell attack it is right up against you in a ranged format so you're probably going to have to step back because it is ranged or it's disadvantage to hit up to you he might it's your call or take disadvantage on the strike because it is a ranged attack if you're still within melee with him you'll have to step out of melee to not get the disadvantage in doing that he might get an attack of opportunity on you it's not just within five feet it's getting out of the creature's ability okay go ahead and roll twice adding your spell attack okay roll again oh with disadvantage that does hit actually just barely it doesn't have a high armor nope sorry we've been off for two weeks 22 points of radiant damage against it as you blast it this giant flash of divine energy bursts around it causing this glittering beacon the next attack against it has advantage period you can see the creature itself its flames are starting to flicker it looks angry and it looks wounded that end your turn pike are you going to move oh you can bonus action with the sword toward it and attack it if you want so go ahead and make another spell attack so 1d8 plus five if it's higher than what you last rolled grog you're up next 11 to hit oh damage sorry 11 damage to the creature so as the blade arcs past striking again you can see another flash of divine energy technically that would've had advantage i just realized because that's the next attack against it so roll again roll the d20 again okay so it's fine i was seeing if it was going to critical or not yeah because the guiding bolt gave advantage on the next attack and the next attack was the sword so the beacon fades it is now grog's turn that hits you have to roll a 14 or higher to hit 17 hits that's higher than 14 14 hits yeah so all three hit 31 all righty all right 34 okay how do you want to do this wielding pike like a two-handed gnome you drop the axe on the first two strikes the creature stepping backward you jump up in the air and getting about neck-height you swing pike with all your strength pike you feel your jowls get pulled from the g-forces of the sheer strength of the arc what weapon are you using in the battle so as the mace comes through it slams into the side of the skull of the ember roc your hands go numb from the impact as the vibration shivers through your body you watch as the beak and the side of the skull crack and cave inward with a little (squeak) sound it just falls over on the ground all right so we go back to the first round the two soldiers that are guarding you are like what would you like sir where are we going okay they both using their full-- they get all the way up to it they don't have a chance to attack but they're surrounding it with their weapons drawn they're going to probably brutalize it pretty badly next round all right for the purposes of this round too you hear a sound from up in the hallway where xanthas was (pained shout) you watch as xanthas goes flying out a few feet and lands on his back you watch as a small brown bit of hair races across a giant gleaming holy avenger goes across the air-- it's kima (yelling) here we go that is a 15 to hit that hits against his armor class and a natural 20 oh he will it is a concentration spell ooh double sixes on the first one 21 points of damage on the first strike on the critical that is 25 oof that's rough so having to make a concentration check on both on those the first one is a 15 succeeds on the first hit the second one does not it's half damage he rolled a ten he needed to roll 13 or higher yeah it was on the critical so the concentration spell ends you have control of your mind again after that and kima unloading on him yes it is from that total round with the divine smite from her strike he took 62 points of damage from her okay (laughter) yeah he's prone it's ranged attack so when things are on the ground they're a little harder-- you don't get advantage from an ally being adjacent you get to sneak attack them if they're adjacent no worries hits his armor class isn't very high he's a little mage dude yeah both still hit with disadvantage and you get sneak attack-- all right you do get sneak attack on the first hit because kima is adjacent to him 28 on the first hit nice 17 on the second hit how do you want to do this (cheering) as he's on the ground-- he puts his finger up as you nock the first arrow and he goes wait i-- and the first arrow hits him in the shoulder he's like no (nervous laughter) we can-- and he gets that far into the second sentence before the arrow (impact) through his face (whimpers trails off) and the finger goes limp as his eyes go a little dead in the face kima looks up and you and goes (frustrated noise) he was mine she takes the blade and (impact) stabs him anyway (laughter) there's a little more in store here we'll be back here in a minute guys we'll see you in a sec [break] it's that color right there for one of the deckboxes so super gimpo man and southern dragon 22 congratulations well done all right guys so the dust of the battle settling the plumes of smoke slowly beginning to dissipate as the fires burn out from the previous struggle the remaining living soldiers begin to gather their dead and wounded and you guys begin to reconvene as allies towards the broken front doors to the outside of fort daxio you search his body all righty sure if you want to how many points do you have grog 25 hitpoints on grog i don't know right now it doesn't work that way all right so as you guys are looting the giant has giant black iron plate mail on which is very heavy it is-- it's going to take a few hands to pull off as well as her great maul which is also very large and about 812 gold pieces you could hold it but you couldn't wield it yes sizewise it's maybe about three feet taller than you from head to pommel and the weight of it is unwieldy for your size okay you find on xanthas-- you find 1098 gold pieces you find a potion of superior healing that he didn't have a chance to use and there appears to be a wand that is shattered it looks like it has broken and there's a little bit of a burn mark on the wood the wand was crafted from okay make an arcana check definitely busted and it was once a wand i hate you so much sam nothing continue no not until now yeah i've been focused on other things i blame you internet you're partially responsible for this oh boy some things never die it is a legacy it's true it's pretty great one of the downsides of having hundreds of hours of video of you on the internet is those are everywhere it's wonderful i'm glad you guys have come to enjoy it probably yeah somebody do a supercut please too late guys okay go ahead and make some repair checks while you're working on that same tinkering check yeah bad news you're going to need supplies to fix okay yes the giant was looted you're trying to carve something out of the ember-roc go ahead and make a nature check with advantage okay it's hard to pull a lot from the body because the nature of the ember-roc as it passes away parts of it begin to turn to ash but you do manage to pull from a portion of its torso what's called ember-roc oil it is a flammable liquid that burns like a napalm you get about roughly a gallon of it to extract because the rest of it's ruined for it it's worth about 750 gold if you were to try and sell it it's very volatile depending on how you store it just so you're aware so you guys have a vial of ember-roc oil kind of in a way you're not certain the book that you have that details some of these creatures the thing that you had found earlier in the campaign it doesn't tell you details of how the actual liquid is triggered it just says that it is fiery and burns very hot sure as you guys are taking this moment to figure this out eventually you hear what sounds like the crumbling of stone and a few rocks tumble out of the broken open entrance to the fortress and you watch as a couple of guards begin to come out their eyes wide they look like they were in armor and ready to make the final stand among them you see general elle gorgofon the female head of this particular regiment of fort daxio and kima you see them all emerge from it elle looks out to them so you've done well little late but thank you for the assist we'll begin to gather our dead she walks forward and gives you all a nod as she puts her helmet back on puts her blade aside and begins helping their soldiers begin to gather the dead in a pile kima steps up you can see her teeth are clenched and there's still a shaking of rage in her fists and what looks to be streaks of dried tears across her cheek xanthas betrayed us all he arrived alone bloodied asked for aid and protection since allura recognized him we let him in stayed here for a short time saying how bad things had become in emon and spoke with allura alone something sensitive we found her ten minutes later come with me she steps over the stone and leads you inside of the fortress she turns the corner stops staring into the room as you guys approach motions for you to follow her you walk up to one of the small meeting chambers the one that you met elle with when you first arrived here and as you begin to approach kima turns back and says it's okay friends are here and you walk in and you see allura sitting really scared in a corner in her robes sitting in a chair with her knees pulled to her chest her eyes widen as she sees you all and she gets up from her chair and runs over and the person who's probably the first to walk in there would probably be keyleth at this point and just wraps her arms around you and just holds you for a second and shakes she backs away (distressed sounds) i-- i don't know what that is i don't-- can you help her you do have a seventh oh you can definitely cast it at a higher level it doesn't affect it but you can it's all good so as you approach-- kima as you begin to walk forward your hands begin to glow as you reach out your holy symbol beginning to burn with a bright whitish-orange color that mingles with the red and gold of the armor across your chest as the glow sparks in your fingers she goes (gasps) she reaches forward slowly touches and grabs your hand and as it does you watch as the light transfers from your hands and gauntlets into her arms and upper sleeves she winces from it but you keep holding her tight and as it passes up through reaches her mind her face the glow passes through and lifts off her like this gentle steam that lifts off her eyes roll back for a second and close you are a godsend my dear she pulls you in for a big hug and lifts you up off the ground for a second before-- you're heavy now puts you back down that you do that you do as she pulls back she looks at you all and immediately grog and vex you feel yourselves pushed apart as kima rushes up and just grabs her around the side and says don't do that again holds her for a second allura just rubs her head and says i'm sorry i should have been careful we needed allies i didn't know-- and kima says you shut up and she reaches up and gives her a kiss she takes her and holds her to her chest allura holds her and you hear kima quietly sobbing for a moment and she goes i-- well it seems that things have moved a bit quicker in your absence i think it's time to find what we have at our disposal and do what we can to finish this before it comes on us they're about a day south of emon syngorn has returned mikael is leading them northward i haven't checked in i'm sorry i wanted-- i should have let you know i couldn't i didn't-- it seems you found what you went for let's hope it makes the difference at which point kima pushes away from allura her head still down she sniffles back tears looks up punches her in the shoulder allura bumps back and rubs her shoulder i know you know kima turns around and walks out of the room in a little bit of a huff her lower lip quivering allura now smiles for the first time since you came in all right if you can do your thing so you bring back dragging this bloody body leaving this trail through the fort there's bits of rock and rubble around and you're like oops drag him over them as you go all right so that is a 3rd-level spell okay so this would be the one if you had it prepared it has to be prepared all righty great can ask the corpse up to five questions just be aware of the rule too the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it and it recognizes you as an enemy you can also discern lies if you get a high enough insight this is still-- this isn't free answers this is still an interrogation well technically it's pike asking the questions since it is her spell so whatever questions you ask have to go through her yeah you guys have not engaged him beyond a brief fuck-you-type conversation in and out all right what are you doing casting the spell all right so as grog throws it on the ground skids for a second you begin casting the spell as you're casting it kima walks up and kicks it one more time and then walks away you finish-- it takes you-- it's a very quick action but as you finish you watch as the air itself seems to form this mist around the corpse and the mist absorbs into the body all of a sudden the jaw opens air fills its chest and the head leans up the eyes still staring off into the distance but it seems to be addressing you pike make a persuasion check the head creaks a little bit as it tilts upward you can hear the unnatural puppeteering of the body trying to speak not the spirit but the body's memory he's had no visits he speaks through his crystals naught but two days before maybe less a scouting party left emon saw activity at the fort and when they checked they saw you and you were marked sure you get the sense that might be what he's referring to and you get the sense that long ago when you guys were high up on the broom looking out towards emon you missed seeing something that was possibly-- okay so far none of the questions seem to be probing too deeply and he seems to be on the level with pike secrets just the traverse junction that's where he used to work that's the-- or the tunnels beneath but those are where the clasp reign dominion there are a few groups but beneath the city the resistance builds we've tried to smoke them out but they keep moving sure kind of hard to read for a dead body but seems to be legit thordak has no fear thordak rules all liam and you can't all make insight checks to cover for the last person failing i know i know 25 seems to be telling the truth from what he knows you get the sense that in a strange way while he was an intelligent fellow he was also kind of a sniveling patsy and the way that kima's talked off the cuff since this began to happen since you began to prepare for the corpse she seems to have a history or at least her and allura both have a history with him in the city and he was basically a spineless coward the spell at this point has subsided and the last bit of energy and mist that had entered the body slowly drifts out of the open mouth and nose (gasps) and the corpse goes cold okay and there are large pyres for a lot of the lizardmen corpses and wyvern pieces they've all been thrown all the rest of the dead soldiers have been rounded up and have blankets and cloth whatever's nearby to haul them over the wall and begin to recount who fell among them okay you concentrate on the stone for a minute your form begins to shift your physicality begins to almost liquefy and then swirls and vanishes from view you open your eyes and you're in shadow you're in shade you're in this little nook at the side of the rock crevasse and you hear two voices go (surprised gasp) and you look immediately to your left and you see hunin and kyor are both there one of them has dropped the crystal on the ground-- sorry sorry it started glowing and i got scared i'm glad you're safe too is everything okay they both look at each other okay and hunin takes kyor by the hand and they both walk after you as you make your way back towards fort daxio the rest of you-- okay they both climb up after an awkward five minutes of trying to convince them that it's okay trinket nudges them a little bit and they get up on top they're both riding on top of him and he's proudly walking (bear grunts) okay yeah she's nearby she was helping gather the dead and she was talking with general elle and getting the ideas of what the next course of action is and as you approach her she turns to you and as she recognizes your approach and goes looking to probably make a jaunt to whitestone shortly and see what we've gathered on that end i can bring everyone with me if you'd like you can stay here if you like but it is and it was beyond the capability of that man but he pulled out a small wooden trinket in front of me which shattered and sent me into my stupor yes sam and initially it seemed to be some sort of a shock force apparently that fire giant was their reinforcements or a general i know not from what you've told me at the very least there weren't any powerful entities here at the get go either i don't think it was sent as a full-scale assault more than it was at this stage just enough to harry and see what was here xanthas none of us were in contact with him i hadn't seen him probably in the better part of a year as far as i know and the information i have received from syngorn they've taken the rest of the troops under general mikael daxio as well as the forces of syngorn and they're marching towards emon one day out they're making their way northward towards daxio they're a day out from emon but they have to-- it's in the pathway they will and in doing so it's about a four-day journey on foot for those troops to make it here to fort daxio as you as that elle pulls forward her helmet under her arm last count looks like we have 55 strong surviving that was my plan yes that's a very broad question at this point it's probably a little later afternoon you're maybe an hour hour and a half from sunset the fort's actually holding pretty well other than the front doors which need to be repaired and right now there isn't anything beyond just putting things in the way because of the impact of the giant the outer wall's taken quite a bit of damage but the fortress itself for the most part is standing general elle says i can do that don't worry and don't make fun of my horns it's a very specific sound my soldiers are trained to hear of course yes you will if you want to there is a hearth in one of the common-room areas they do there are a few bathrooms that can be there's nothing terribly comfortable but there are blankets it does get cold this far north it's not in the winter months anymore but just south of the cliffkeep mountains in this area it does get kinda chilly so there are blankets there are hides there are things to keep warm in okay all right the rest of you guys find yourselves to rest for the evening okay those who care to you clean up and find rest as well the food is meager but serviceable and you all find yourselves an evening's rest unperturbed a good nine ten hours pass of intense sleep as you all are sore you are all exhausted-- although you do recover your point of exhaustion scanlan that's gone-- as do you from your frenzied rage-- you all come to consciousness shortly after daybreak i'd say you got to bed probably right around sunset or a little bit past sunset so it's just starting to get the sun over the mountains the day is yours allura raises her hand i can still take us there that was the plan but i mean it's up to you we could find a tree i suppose oh i cannot do that unfortunately i haven't seen raishan we've been at the fort this entire time waiting for your return all right you find your way out to one of the slightly charred trees in the main courtyard area you open the portal (whoosh) as it opens your two celestial-blooded children guide you through as well as kima and allura into whitestone you emerge from the sun tree in the morning hours there as well the city is quiet you can see that a lot of the guard has been gathering arms and armor just in case they were ever called to be part of this fray and the city just seems to be on high alert but everything is intact whitestone appears to be fine and the castle looms northward from your current position you guys make your way towards whitestone castle the guards greet you and lead you inside within minutes cassandra has been summoned down and says percival thank god you've returned you're alive that's-- look the last time you left you did not come back in the best of places i'm just beginning to think-- speaking of asum come who are these you're the best foster mom ever you watch their noses scrunch a little as you entirely butcher their names hunin and kyor yes k-y-o-r yes we can find them a room that's fine not to worry fine they're in their late teens mid- to late teens cassandra's a little bit older though she doesn't act it she acts like fifteen years her senior and always has all right you guys head upstairs with her she leads you-- oh no she does not lead you upstairs she leads you downstairs through the tunnels towards the ziggurat and as she's walking along she says well we've managed to relocate the meeting room and it required a bit of careful discussion as to our current allies as well the transport was a bit awkward for asum and his companion and the dragon cannot maintain her usual form around the ziggurat so just be ready as you guys make your way into the ziggurat chamber you can see already there's the platform on the outside of the central area where the new situation is set and you see there's a table and you can already hear discussion off that way and there are a few servants that are bringing food and drinks up there as part of the morning breakfast for those who are in their meeting and you see there right on the outskirts of the table wrapped and curled up a gargantuan green dragon with its head resting on its claws that is listening in on part of the conversation to cassandra to the room okay so as you head up to the platform everyone pauses and looks over asum stands up-- you can see now this being the real asum-- acid-scarred across the face just as raishan's form arriving was and sitting on the opposite end of raishan and you can see there's this very much kind of-- especially as a master of spies and information understands the importance of you know strange bedfellows given the circumstances in war but is still not at ease and doesn't seem to keep-- always has one eye on the dragon at all times but gives a nod it's good to see that you're all alive and we have much to discuss please come sit you've met brom before and you look over and you can see brom goldhand the same square-jawed shorter black unkempt hair the cleric of ioun that was and is part of the council however the skin is covered in burn scars like the face some of the features are kind of missing all the exposed elements beyond the armor are just burned but he stands and bows to everyone it is good to see you all alive he sits down at the table cassandra takes a seat raishan has said nothing is just watching you all as you sit down gives a nod allura flanks behind you kima has been asked not to attend (chuckles) allura sits down on-- there's a few stools whatever chairs were available were brought in here so it's a ramshackle meeting room given how many butts have to sit around this area but you are all here so i've been told that you were at daxio and gathering other allies about please let us know what the circumstance is from your end of things things are not as well from ours wonderful but daxio's been attacked then i would not recommend taking folks to fort daxio especially if it's sustained damage well we've been busy in emon the eyes glance over at raishan and well needless to say things have gone a bit strange we've been working with spireling shenn and the clasp and we've been able to smuggle thousands of denizens of emon beneath the city those that were not directly enslaved or gave fealty to the cinder king out of fear and other interests we've been able to keep safe and we've moved through the tunnels as often as possible there are still many many many wyvern riders that patrol the city the townfolk have run out of offerings and are now being sent out in slave groups to pull goods from nearby cities to bring at the feet of the dragon we also have a rising volcanic mass rising up beneath the city that has consumed a number of the underground clasp tunnels and has been slowly pinching off our mobility beneath the town so our intent to hopefully find some sort of retort or vengeance and eventually take down the dragon that clock is definitely ticking now we've been keeping as best an eye on thordak as we can brom bless him and his sacrifices has been our front man for this and we know the creature has been shedding scales in places where jets of ever-burning flame now spark and burn the city itself wherever each one of these scales falls it seems to be a beacon or source of its own white-hot fire so the city is now a pitfall of its own right the creature itself the dragon it has these jets that now burst from underneath its armor fire that licks beyond it it has a crest of red crystals now that begin to twist behind its horns and head its eyes are like white-hot stars from the sky it's it's still dragon-like but something more primal and elemental (sighs) i'm not entirely certain what we're dealing with here but brom you've made some headway and brom clears his throat (ahem) myself and a few devout have been doing our best to prepare surviving warriors and guards and mages who were ousted from the lyceum we have a few strike teams that have been effective in harrying the outside of his defenses learning information we can knocking down the guardians since the fire giants have arrived it's been a little more difficult so we've been reduced to stealth missions quick in and out we don't have the muscle to assault head-on up until recently his eyes pass over to you you say there are armies making their way to the city and we have you all the strength that you've gained and the stories i've heard from people here at whitestone if we're going to do something we need to do it soon now the lyceum has fallen to those that have sworn fealty to the cinder king so we don't have use of those artifacts anymore we've been trying to break through to the inner sanctum of the cloudtop what the dragon now calls its home its lair it's burrowed this deep underground basin where it resides now it only emerges when summoned or called to or when it decides to make a proclamation drawing what little bit of children or families that it sees as a fun bit of play to watch them bow and quiver in the street before asking for someone to prove their strength and their worship of himself and strike them where they stand some days he's angry some days he's laughing this dragon is completely insane we can't really gauge red dragons are known for pride and you could count on that use it against them but sometimes his jaws quiver as he cries and shakes and yells out laughing into the sky a terrible laughter one that can induce the worst of nightmares i don't know what we're dealing with anymore however we did have one team a very brave team that provoked the dragon to leave its lair and held it long enough for us to move past it and pierce the inside of its sanctum now we passed the wards and the pools of fire the beast returned before we could get too far and i lost most of my men myself barely surviving with my life and the scars to tell of it but the beast is building something in that lair something it is guarding fiercely and something that it will not leave something that i think it has come to hold more dear than the city it now presides over if there is a key to piercing its pride or if there is a reason to take it down i begin to fear what it's holding below the city now by the might of the wounded mistress of knowledge ioun in the channels in which we speak that is all the information i have i hope it's helped in some way and he sits down in his chair and clutches his holy symbol raishan's head slowly turns towards you and the nostrils kind of (snort) not in an aggressive way but in acknowledgement the bright yellowish eyes you can see the blackened veins that curl up past the scales some of the scales actually splitting and pulling open what you can see would be some sort of a contagion-based wound that while not infected does not look positive raishan's lips curl up and the voice billows forth a low curling growl well if the madness continues to spread and our recent conversations confirm this you've gathered your allies distraction attack confusion chaos striking towards the center of the city is the best chance we have if we have a way in to break the cloudtop we can battle it there draw it from its lair force it to possibly rescind within and have our final battle there or if luck is with us finish it on the streets itself and discover whatever it is it's keeping while it lies dead and burning in the street what have i to gain by watching you do this yourself i have no idea he lets nothing within his sanctum make an insight check 23 thinks for a minute i do not know of this sphinx i am sorry there is a temple to ioun in vasselheim that is good many temples have fallen and hidden through the years since our mistress was wounded i can beseech my mistress for information but short of travelling to vasselheim which i have not been to i cannot help you i apologise since the calamity during the struggle with tharizdun my mistress was grievously wounded in the struggle and since then has been diminished and in this time many of those that seek to lessen her hold on the world and the spread of the information and knowledge that we wish to share have then hunted and persecuted those of us that follow in her wake so the temples have been buried or kept in distributed information through anonymous channels only a few of us in positions of protection can speak out so strongly this surprisingly he turns back towards the ziggurat this was one such temple tharizdun the chained oblivion yes a very evil one sealed chained away nothing you need to worry about not in the midst of this cassandra says yes the airship has been told to make its way towards fort daxio well you didn't learn about the vestiges until it was-- yeah kamaljiori it was yeah yes you take all the vestiges and and smush them into a pile on the central table and all the rest of the council kind of-- --look curiously and they all gather around as you begin to place them all into the central area kind of overlapping in almost the shape of a person who is built of vestiges you put them each one down their kind of magical essence clinging with the surface of the stone table all right the sound of them impacting they all sit there on the table no everyone's kind of standing there watching quietly as nothing happens and then asum goes all right then um yeah we had that discussion you need things beneath the armor or it'll cut you to shit that'd be a bad idea you'd get pinched in all the wrong places cassandra kind of raises her hand and goes kashaw and zahra they are ready to go whenever you are ready shaun we've -- we're trying to decide if it is best to keep someone here to maintain the barrier or if we are going all in on this if we just send everyone out there and leave the city defenseless allura raises her hand and goes either i or shaun can run the barrier you can decide i don't mind staying back or going to the forefront it's your choice which one of us to take i believe he can yes it's interesting i have a lot of personal history with thordak i feel a deep sense of responsibility for all of this that still eats away at me and because of that a part of me really longs to be there with all of you putting this dark and fiery chapter to rest on the other hand having already faced him and having an inkling of what he is now every part of me wants to run away screaming i have i lost many good people in doing so most likely so the choice is yours vox machina you watch her audibly (sighs) it's both it's a lot of things it's an emotionally conflicted exhale but it is a relief of tension regardless that's d&d man allura turns to you kind of takes the side of your head in her hands and says and in becoming a leader you've been put in a position to make very difficult choices as you grow as a leader you'll have to make many more this is not my choice to make who do you choose keyleth at this point raishan picks up and goes-- oh god at the rate this is going i think perhaps neither of them are going to make it the survivor goes to emon last i checked he's handling the barrier but he's a capable man may need a bit of rest but so did you there are a few chuckles at the table now as everyone is just dumbfoundedly watching you all argue over who to take for five minutes vox machina i'm not going what are you talking about no that's suicide they make me baguettes every morning in whitestone i'm staying here (laughter) allura kind of nods and goes very well i'll send kima as well all the strength that we have in your direction i'll stay here and play guardian of whitestone as i have for quite some time she looks to cassandra looks to raishan everyone else they all kind of nod and cassandra stands up holds her collar and-- it's interesting in moments like these that such a young girl still carries the weight of a room like this of such giants by comparison to her and still can command attention so quickly with a subtle physicality and then she adjusts her collar a bit and raises her chin and so it is vox machina we gather our forces put your minds together decide on your plan of action your means of attack soon we begin the assault on emon and that's where we'll end our episode for tonight you guys thank you very much we're on the home stretch it looks like man all right you guys have a week to plan amongst yourselves what to do next time correct yes you've only used your spell there we will unfortunately not have a travis willingham next week or ashley johnson however based on the gathering of allies just for this battle we may have a guest or two (gasps) you guys are gathering all your allies yeah man the dark carnival's here (laughter) just start spraying faygo all over you guys i wish i wish that'd be great all right cool thank you loot crate again for being a great sponsor thank you guys so much for watching tonight we'll see you tuesday at talks machina and thursday for the continuation of this climactic downwards spiral into ancient red dragon territory
