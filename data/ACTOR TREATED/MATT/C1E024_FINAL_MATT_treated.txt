any announcements you want to make sam or shall we jump in all righty then in just a minute let us begin this next episode of critical role [dramatic music] pike left back there to finish up the renovation of the temple of sarenrae that was discovered the rest of the party moved on back to emon the rest of their business complete within emon they returned to greyskull keep where they encountered a fan apparently of vox machina that had been camping for two weeks outside who was promptly bludgeoned in the temple by vax to teach him a lesson brought back from the brink and taught that hard lesson-- that this is a dangerous field-- managed to seemingly reach out and touch the heart of this young intrepid wannabe adventurer to possibly try and better himself before he throws himself into danger's way and he ran off to train harder indeed upon returning to the keep notice was sent off to one of the other members of the council of tal'dorei seeker asum who is the halfling head of whispers and all sorts of subterfuge across the countryside who came to you notifying you that within a week's time the briarwoods lord and lady briarwood are supposed to be arriving here within emon for a feast to discuss building a bridge and a more political joining between emon the tal'dorei royal family and these up-and-coming lords and ladies who have a very dark history with percy's character you've been asked to join as part of this feast as you previously requested with sovereign tal'dorei that should anything involved the briarwoods that you be included you have a week to figure out what you want to do in advance of that and that is where we left off right now after this discussion you guys' arrival i'd say it's probably mid-afternoon first things first though after this discussion with seeker asum who leaves the keep you do have a brief moment of awkward silence as most of the people that work within your keep turn to you laina looks about the rest of you and goes by the way we've been working here for about six weeks on the pay of four we're coming close to our next pay scheme and you tend to leave often and for extended periods of time we would also like to be paid if possible she thinks to herself for a moment at which point you see erwen the elderly servant in the back says actually you had previously said it was both of our services was 50 gold each for the month and if i recall the other mercenaries or guardians that you've hired to watch the walls of the keep were at a discussed 100 gold for the month's wages each you currently have five on your payroll yes 600 gold pieces total per month for the services for everyone keeping your keep thank you so much i'll make sure this gets to the appropriate individuals immediately they'll be very happy to not have to walk away  erwen steps in and by the way if you do intend to leave for an extended period of time again i would recommend perhaps paying that in advance there was a bit of unrest last time very well sire i shall disseminate this amongst the others yeah you're down in the workshop you can thank you kindly tiberius thank you and he wanders off and begins counting out change into a smaller purse oh you mean the lyceum okay the alabaster lyceum all right so you make your way towards the alabaster lyceum the rest of you head down into percy's workshop so you head around the outskirts of the inner portion of the keep itself down the stairway that leads to the basement floor which contains a small cell like a holding cell that you had constructed for you in case you had somebody to take prisoner at some point to the right to the left of you there's a small turning hallway that leads to the workshop the workshop contains a series of various tools workbenches it actually has a working forge with anvil and various blacksmithing tools and as you guys come down the heat is already blasting from it and you can see percy madly diving into work of some kind okay lockheed enjoys them thoroughly they're delicious comfort food crafted by the finest of cooks in greyskull keep i'll give you a d6 inspiration die (laughter) you do not have to no you reach over and grab it and it's a large set of tongs used for gripping large heavy pieces of metal either for the actual forge itself or to bend and manipulate on the workbench make a sleight of hand check sleight of hand she gives you the evil eye ah interesting you know your tools very well in your workshop and yeah the metal is scarred and pockmarked from use with the various corrosive chemicals to kraghammer on horseback it's about two and a half days fast and back i'd say just under two days probably i'd say well the horse is probably a little bit faster than the eagle i'd say it'd put you there about the same pace about two days on eagle because you can just go straight through i mean you want to take the road because you know that there's a lot of dangerous things that wander the wild that are between there you know i deduct points for metagaming by horseback you want to stick to the road by air-- you can stay in beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level five hours right now you can transform for so you could beast shape twice rest 30 minutes beast shape twice about this time you start to get this weird tingling sensation around your fingers no they crave some sort of an agent that will prevent the now slight burning sensation it does the slight burning sensation now has turned into a very vibrant burning white hot on the skin and you can see bits of the skin start to peel back a little bit beginning on the edges it foams up a little bit in places but it is neutralized all righty you easily get another meal mustered for you you're working in the workshop you're eating you guys are going to gilmore's all right so as this is happening tiberius you make your way over to the alabaster lyceum you come up to the front main area of the structure itself it's an arcane college you make your way to the front clerk who looks up to you a nice young fellow looks like he's trying to work through his credit in school through his training he's dressed in the ceremonial robes of somebody who is a student who is currently stuck with the job of working as a clerk he's like hi can i help you where have i heard that-- if you're talking about sigils for teleportation you would probably have to discuss that with gatekeeper xanthas no i'm the clerk i run the front of the-- follow me and he gets up and leads you further into the structure to the central circular room the white-marbled room that contains all the doors around and in the center there is the traverse junction this is the place you guys have stumbled into every single time you've teleported back to emon and there you see the elven wizard who you recently bothered naught but maybe five hours ago who is currently setting up some sheets comes back oh hello again i get an understanding here that you're seeking access to one of our many sigil-based rooms of transference those rooms are currently under very protected lock and key approval by the headmaster thurmond adalum himself glances over at the clerk who goes right this way mr stormwind he leads you back to a long long hallway with arched ceiling you can see the marble itself has these carvings and sculptures of various dead-looking faces of long-passed mages that either were built or held in high esteem in the halls of this lyceum at the very end it opens up into a pretty well-decorated almost over-the-top decorated office room for the headmaster himself the interior is lined with large large 15 20-foot-tall bookshelves around this oval room with sliding ladders that are attached to them that slowly glide on their own like they're on some sort of arcane-based pattern that puts them back and forth there is a large chandelier of brightly colored orbs that sits 35 40 feet in the air that slowly rotates on its own that keeps this slowly fluctuating changing color of the room and in the center there is a circular desk and sitting there at the desk you can see is headmaster thurmond who is this extremely elderly human male shaved face very short curved bald head with a little bit of hair in the back hunched forward and is currently collecting a series of books into his arms looks like he's about to get up and he turns and looks over can i help you what do you require from me then if you're asking for access to one of our closely guarded sigils for the thunderbrands you say within kraghammer well then i will-- just one moment and he reaches into a pouch and pulls out this mirror this oval mirror and sets it onto his desk reaches underneath and pulls out a small chest opens up the chest and you can see in this chest that there are probably two dozen of these tiny little marbles all different colors some different shapes and he goes these little labels you can't really see from your perspective he takes one out places it in the top of the mirror and as he does the mirror all of a sudden shimmers for a second and what was originally a normal reflection is now this light glowing blue slightly glowing water-like surface he takes it and lifts it up to himself hello hello hello a moment later you hear this distant voice echoing with this strange warbling filter over it i'm coming what's taking your time yes headmaster what do you require well there's a gentleman here dragonborn who is requesting use of your sigil of teleportation do you know this gentleman turns it around and you can see in there this is the same long-bearded dwarven individual that met you at the actual thunderbrand house and had a bit of an argument with you early in your travels in kraghammer now listen here last we spoke you and your friends stormed into our lair nearly destroyed our precious arcane defenses of our homestead-- make a deception check this is deception well you are an alcoholic but that wasn't what he meant 20 (laughs) he goes either way we can't just let anyone willy-nilly knowing how to directly appear in the center of our homestead make a persuasion roll 11 his head turns to the side a little bit peering through you with a slight scowl last we talked the reason we didn't report you to the guard for breaking through our defenses was you promised to look beneath the city and bring back various artifacts you were in search of did you now can i see one of these artifacts we're done here headmaster and the mirror shimmers and closes suddenly the headmaster takes the marble out and says i'm sorry that didn't seem to go your way all righty you're eating you're crafting are you going with the rest of them to gilmore all right you guys make your way to the outside of gilmore's glorious goods as far as time goes you haven't quite gotten to that point yet for these guys you get to gilmore's you enter the interior you can see that for the most part there aren't a lot of people in here it's getting later in the day and a lot of the customer business seems to be happening almost earlier either pre-noon or around noon there's no current sign of gilmore you do see across the way-- what's her name again thank you sherri the mousy helper who runs the shop in gilmore's absence or at least runs the first portion of it with her thick glasses up on her nose and she's sitting there with her elbows over the top of the main desk she looks up as you enter and takes her glasses and pokes them for a second hello hi right i do and you should be wearing it proudly yes now what can i help you with gilmore's in westruun currently setting up the expansion of the gilmore's glorious goods business if this is important i can certainly summon him here all right i suppose yes i can actually she pulls out a small sheet of what looks like a rough-around-the-edges piece of parchment and starts the inkwell scribbling down all right (foreign words) it flashes and disappears in front of her well then he'll be receiving the message right about now we'll pass that on and whenever he returns i'm certain he will get back to you and deal with whatever business is necessary we are open yes it's possible we haven't completely restocked the shelves as of late i know we had some new things come in i can go check and as she turns all of a sudden there's a large vibrant white flash of light and a sound from the back room the beaded curtains shift for a second and you hear heavy footsteps and pushing through the beaded curtain you see before you with a bead of sweat on his head gilmore i'm so glad you came back sam and i'm sorry i was out and about running some business a ways away how could i miss seeing my fine-- there's not as many of you as usual he looks over at the rest of the group well i mean-- (laughter) matt but of course he walks back through the beaded curtain giving you this look over his shoulder as he does the curtain falls behind him and you can see now as the glow gently fades there is a rug that is pushed to the side and on the floor of his room there is a familiar sigil similar to the one that you've seen tiberius scrawl before in some of his spells that's apparently how he got here so quickly but he walks in and he kicks the rug back over it sits down on the edge of his bed puts his hands up and goes what seems to be troubling you yes that's all right i understand people grow busy there are things you must tend to and that's all right and i appreciate you being so honest i really do while that's happening the rest of you are left there awkwardly staring about a few minutes go by sherri comes back she brings two books over best i can tell these may be what you're looking for i can't quite-- she sets them down one is a book that is the properties of various liquids chemicals and things that are found on this plane and otherwise it's a good way to locate and identify phantom liquids should you come across any the other book appears to have a section about alchemy it's essentially almost a beginner's guide but it's a very very easy-to-follow introduction to a number of various low-level sorceries and the creation of low-level spell components preparing them for use with spell-casting and there is a chapter on a little bit of alchemy they haven't been priced yet 25 gold each make a persuasion roll she reaches out and takes the books and slides them back and says well if that's how you feel perhaps these can be returned to those university students that perhaps left them by i should put these in the lost and found good luck i can hear you i'm right here (laughter) yes i'm happy to help you that yes we do have a couple of those hold on she darts up the stairway in the other room and goes to the second floor a few moments later she comes back down with these two small chests-- they're about that big each one's a lighter wood color the other is painted black all over we have both of these they should shield something of this size from most low-level magical detections these will run you about 200 gold apiece if you were a little taller yes well looking at these this one-- she points to the one that looks like just a casual wood chest this would be easier to hide in plain sight amongst the rest of your furniture this one however would be difficult to locate in a more shaded or lightless circumstance then perhaps this one yes this vial if i recall it has this small-- no this is the one that was found-- right yes okay there we go and make a persuasion roll actually on this one she looks at you and goes you have been good patrons and you have been much kinder to me than others we'll put this one on the house we'll call this on the house and as she takes the vial sets it down and she pulls out another book that she shuffles through puts it up turns through a few pages until looking through this here would be a potion of fire breath when imbibed it should give you a temporary time period of the ability to breathe fire much like a relatively young dragon this one in particular is fire there are many different vials like this that pertain to different colorations of dragon but this one is specifically for the red like a flyer those can be printed there is a-- actually a pretty well-designed print facility not that far up the road at which point for the first time since the entire time you've been in the shop of gilmore's glorious goods you see a slight grin creep across her lips she goes how could a lady say no to a song 25 gold the price stands we run a business here yes she pulls the books out pay for the books you can see her face is flushed and she (clears throat) thank you she's red in the face at this point in time the beaded curtains reopen have you finished the conversation or do you want to keep going as far as i'm aware this city has been doing rather well since winter's crest just this previous year trade has been booming we're opening up pathways all across the continent we've improved relations with many other distant kingdoms and i'm opening a second shop i mean that's amazing and who would've thought so far so good we're going through the construction process and i'm making sure that i have a rather supple income of artifacts and oddities that i have to sell at both locations i have to widen my input of various items and-- oh yes eventually you can see he's a little more worn than you've seen gilmore before he's still gilmore and he's excited but after the tale you told him and opening the second shop has been a little rough on him and his jovial self is a little more wearied though he still looks fabulous just praise the brand praise the brand young vax yes yes i remember him what kind of favor my sigil here is for returning personal use did you hear that there was some strange noise in the sky this is for my return as far as outgoing most other sigils are-- well they're up here looking for that you're going to have to go to the lyceum i'm afraid however if you're going to the lyceum i am owed a favor or two let me see what i can do here and he goes and he pulls out another piece of similar paper and he writes a quick little note on the side sends it up in the air and it vanishes he goes i've just done you a favor keep that in mind you go to the lyceum you should have access to one of these sigils make sure you choose properly you only have one then don't be the one that does it talk to your friend this tiberius fellow he'll know what to do i'm sure right you mentioned this last time when you almost opened a line of gilmore's glorious credit previously we discussed 25000 gold pieces the amount of which you were going to retrieve retrieve the deal was since you did not have funds and you had to retrieve this money from this 'dwarf town' as you so graciously put it that you would borrow the money at the time and then pay me back within a month within a month correct you backed out last minute when you realized there was apparently hidden platinum-- if you want something functional there are masterwork daggers out there we do have base-level enchantments that give you a fine honed edge and a balance that cannot be beaten for its price range for that i can easily give you one of our base-level enchanted items for no more than friend discount included 400 gold pieces you may all right i'll get these right now he stands up and now that there's some sort of business involved he's completely renovated and recharged he comes through the beaded curtain again you guys see gilmore burst out like (laughs) we're in business and he goes into the next room and back up the stairs and takes a few moments he comes back down with an armful of these daggers and sets them down on the counter three for you that'll be 1200 gold pieces please the least i could do pay me back i'll find you indeed they are plus-one enchanted daggers yes at this point now tiberius you have coasted over the air and as you come careening in you hear (swishing sounds) and look down two crossbow bolts whiz past you at which you hear immediately oh sorry sorry we're not used to having you bolt in from the skyline as you sweep past shayne and cordell they both change their bolts and they're both arguing with each other like you should've seen it was him sorry sorry again you make your way into the courtyard inside greyskull keep you're not with him there you're pretty out of range at this point it was actually a magical item one that you may have equipped it'll say in the description of the item that it has an inscription on the back protection of some kind if i recall amulet look in the description of the item it should say underneath the name it'll have the actual inscription written in the descriptor of the item it is enchanted just those two now all of a sudden you're (whoosh) lifted up in the air you can it takes a moment to adjust to it it takes you a little bit but you do eventually get control of it propulsion does work yep and as you guys coast over you see leaving the exterior wall gate to the south side of emon you see the rest of your party walking back towards the keep so you fly down and cast fly on the rest of them you guys are now floating you guys are floating as well you're coasting over emon for roughly 12 or so seconds before grog you drop to the ground and now tiberius and vex you begin to plummet fly is a concentration spell you cast it again your amulet keeps it up for two rounds which is 12 seconds and then the previous fly spell deteriorates that's what i'm saying the circlet lets you maintain concentration for two additional rounds at that point now all of you guys are flying you make your way now all of you following tiberius you coast down to the alabaster lyceum landing right through the front area (whoosh) this whole party appears catch your feet and there you see the same clerk looking up ah i see you've returned down that hallway follow it to the very end you're welcome you all glide through the hallway or walk if you prefer the end of the hallway you open once again into the office and there you see behind his desk once again the headmaster thurmond who looks around oh yes you've returned i received the note from your friend gilmore and you're welcome to utilize one of our sigils to kraghammer was it two notes there is no sigil in vasselheim they have been outlawed and destroyed to prevent arcane intrusion or subterfuge there have been historically many a war's passed in which vasselheim nearly fell to the sudden appearance of small armies within its walls and as such many of these sigils all of them have been destroyed over the past 1000 years however it was the third war-- and he's going into a long diatribe about the history of vasselheim certainly yes i'm sorry the mirror he pulls up the mirror pulls out his chest brings out the same marble again pops it into the mirror it shimmers hello hello you hear another voice say oh are you kidding me really you again all right what are you bothering me with what's it say i can't read it from here read it out for me at which point you see the eyes of this dwarf that were very untrusting open wide for a second all right give him the sigil send him through i'll see you soon the mirror gives out again no the headmaster takes the mirror and puts it down he points back to the clerk who's in the hallway behind you again waiting and says go ahead and bring them to the junction allow them access to the sigil for house thunderbrand in kraghammer he nods of course he leads you to the junction and there is one of the doors he opens up on the inside there is the actual sigil to kraghammer there he gives you some time to study it you memorize it you get it locked in and you now permanently know the sigil of teleportation to kraghammer within the house thunderbrand so you guys head back to the keep you meet up with grog and percy what about you guys what're you doing for tiberius scanlan and vex well it's just the sigil you have to cast the spell laura and at this point in time with all the travel back and forth it's getting close to dusk yeah it's been crafted for you yeah it's not a swallow it's a quarterstaff with knives attached okay yeah there are a couple blacksmiths that you know about on the way through best reputation is karin but she's a specialist she's the one that made trinket's-- all right you go on and approach there she's currently working away on some custom piece that she's currently working on she's like hello can i help you dragonborn what can i help you with what i can certainly try yeah aye all right it would take me about two days and you've already supplied the material other than a bit of the side bits i'll say i'll charge you 100 gold pieces aye i'm a specialist certainly thank you all right it should be done within the next two days you're free to come by and check on it if you like but it'll be done huh oh you're friends with that one she was real nice that bear was adorable happy to help with that one oh is that what it was probably had it's just been a while oh you're so cute lockheed you guys talk for a little bit and eventually make your way back yeah you guys are right outside all right you guys head back to the keep go ahead and roll perception for this because it's not active it would be your passive vax has vanished while you might have noticed instead the explosion-like eruption of gas from your dragonborn friend distracted you and gave him the proper getaway you vanish the individual you stopped is a younger gentleman probably in his mid-20s or so a bit dirty in the face and coming from a day of work going to the local tavern to finish his eve with some drinks i can't say i do i mean there are butchers all over town there's one-- oh that would be north side of emon that way he points you towards the-- it will take you about from where you are right now 30 minutes all right so you guys get back to the keep grog has eaten his fill yeah passed out percy's nowhere to be seen you i would like for you to make a tinkering roll in relation to the construction of ammunition ten you manage to utilizing material for 20 bullets only craft ten but you get ten bullets out of it as opposed to wasting the materials you can certainly try there's a difference between poison and disease they're different the potion seems to have no effect it doesn't have any effect for the day that's what you spent making tomorrow we'll get to whatever it is you want to craft then you go off and manage to make your way to the upper slums best i can gather he'd be around that way she points you and the breath is awful she's missing teeth but her crooked finger curves off to the side and you can see across the way next to a homestead or hovel there is a very humble-looking butcher that is currently in the process of closing shop all right you make your way up there you can see there's an older gentleman in his mid-40s or so salt-and-pepper hair black with a bit of gray on the sides is currently in the process of closing up it's hard to tell it looks like a business from this perspective you look through the windows there's a dull light on the inside from what looks like a small hooded lantern set up for a bit of interior light but there's nobody else in the house you listen for a while make a perception roll all right as you continue to listen eventually you hear the slamming of wood you look off and through the bit of the glass window-- you're peeking from the side-- you see the same gentleman who was closing the shop enter the room where the hooded lantern is there's a table he sits down quietly for a second looks at the lamp starts cleaning his fingernails a little bit gives a big sigh and turns off the light of the lantern and exits the room closing the door behind him it's one floor you checked the window it's not locked you slip in without a problem you've done this many times before it's hard to tell looking around the room here there are three doors that exit one that he came through which is apparently from the front of the butcher shop this appears to be a central room that connects to wherever else he walked there are two other doors they're not trapped the door immediately right or the door in front of you the door in front of you is the one that the man traveled through there's the door that he came in from when he sat down and then he left through the door across the way from you and there is a door that been unopened okay you push open the door very quietly it makes a little creaking sound but you stop peering inside it's dark there appears to be a bed there's a small table there's what looks like an old pair of boots that are worn out on the side it looks like a bedroom that nobody's currently in make an investigation check okay you take a little bit of time in peering over the materials looking at the bed size looking at the boot size looking at whatever you can nearby this bed is definitely weathered it's been used for a long time there are a couple of small knick-knacks and toys that are discarded underneath that have been there for a while that lead you to believe that this was at one point a boy's room however what you do notice is that most of the materials most of the belongings anything that you would normally see in a boy's room anything that would say that a person lives here seem to have been hastily grabbed and taken off a couple moments later a voice comes from the other side hello i'm done for business for the day come back tomorrow the door opens a little bit and an eye peeks through you gather there's a slight scent of alcohol from the other side as he starts talking he says i don't know where my son's gone off to he came in in a huff we got in an argument he grabbed his stuff and left he does this every now and then he'll be back this isn't the first time he's done this you said it was money you owed him i can give that to him okay there's something about his face that gives you the feeling that he's more interested in the contents of what you're leaving than actually transferring these to the intended recipient okay closes the door behind you you hear a lock light goes back out in the room okay all right eventually vax finds his way back to the keep the rest of you are there at rest for the evening is there anything else you want to accomplish before the night's out all right you all find yourself to bed for the evening rest up for the next morning and at that point we're going to go ahead and take our break five minutes guys a strict five minutes because we still have a lot to get through a lot to get through tonight don't want to stay late no see you guys in about five minutes quick restroom break we'll be right back [break] that's amazing for many reasons but all of you who

of metal clanging as percy has already been the first to wake and is back in the workshop tiberius you're well-rested everyone's spells have returned you get to make a beard roll 35 what bundlesofkittens by the way won congratulations to bundlesofkittens going to get prizes 35% does count as you wake up you reach up and feel the return of a nice hefty bit of scruff to your chin yeah it's getting pretty thick now it's a good like half an inch to an inch length and you're starting to get a little you notice the first time you grew some facial hair it was coming through that weird creepy translucent color it's starting to come through with a proper almost a dark red-brown color to it so as you all gather for breakfast you get your fill a fine breakfast awaits you already prepared by your servants of the greyskull keep what do you wish to do certainly lockheed enjoys the breakfast lockheed is looking healthier the color is a little more of a deep emerald green and he appears to have a little more energy this morning he hasn't noticed but there is a slight streak of dried pseudo-dragon poo you're not aware of it to cast that yet as a bird owner he does (lizard noises) it sits down on the edge of the table bites your finger (lizard noises) it sits there so what do you want to do at which point the teleportation sigil appears in the center of the floor the way tiberius had prepared it it's glowing right now trinket comes up and like rubs his nose against your coat the sigil's starting to spark-- okay so all of you who are going you leap in you're staying and you're staying correct and you're staying all right keyleth percy and vax all of you guys step in and all of a sudden there's a familiar whoosh of some sort of dark transference you feel as if gravity for a moment doesn't exist and your feet find purchase on some sort of a wooden floor the room is dark you glance about the immediate vicinity and for those of you who have low light there's very little you can actually make out other than the fact this is a basement of some kind and you are amidst a bunch of sheet covered crates as the light fills the room you look around all right lockheed begins trying to shake the light off the tail so it moves around a little bit (chuckles) all right you look around the room there are about six or seven of these crates immediately visible to you they have sheets put over them they're different sizes some sort of storage room there is a staircase that leads to the floor above room looks safe all right you guys make your way to the second floor as you step up to the top you can see there is light emanating from the top of the staircase and a figure moves into the staircase a stout dwarven figure this is the same individual you spoke to previously the dwarf steps to the top and says with an air of annoyance to the voice all right waited up all night for you to arrive and you never did and you come here and interrupt my breakfast it's fine step up the stairs please and he steps out of the way leads you into the central chamber this house is unfamiliar to all but scanlan who turned invisible suddenly and decided to wander in briefly the classic i don't know looking about it's very well-kept it's an old house the ceilings are taller than you expect for a dwarf type home a lot of the ceilings are a little low especially for you grog this one's built roomy there's actually a lot of cultivated cave plant life a lot of boxes that contain various underground dwelling plants and other such funguses the air itself is mixtures of sweet and pungent mixed almost as if there's a spice garden somewhere and you're not really able to take a beat on what the actual interior would smell like it keeps changing around you you're brought to the main foyer area and the dwarf turns back and he says all right you've made your transference where's the amulet it's funny because i already did i gave you a permanent entry to my own household my family's household by offering you this sigil that gave you entrance to the interior of our well-guarded estate that was a trade enough that was what we agreed upon through the mirror so you come into my home and try to extort me he takes the amulet make a persuasion roll it's not going to matter you keep talking and as you're explaining this he's not even paying attention to you the dwarf is staring at the amulet looking at the back of it where the inscription is and you swear for a minute you see what looks like a tear gathering in the corner of the eye of the dwarf who then reaches up and wipes it from the corner and takes the amulet and puts it in the pocket and says my apologies thank you for returning this you were talking about the carpet right laura and you want it to be enchanted we have done a carpet before only one it's very possible not this pattern no that one was more of a blue i mean this can be enchanted but the materials and the time put into it-- it's a very pricey endeavor a carpet of this size especially we're looking at the better part of a year to enchant this and that'll cost you about time included that'll cost 50000 gold pieces well i mean there might be smaller ones you might be able to find elsewhere all right well-- nostoc greyspine you're escorted out of the house thunderbrand make your way down to the quarry at the very bottom level of kraghammer once again it's been a long time since you've been in this portion of the world let alone this city where you started this leg of your entire journey you do make your way down into this area to lord nostoc greyspine's proper office the one where you managed to procure his expensive wine and make this venture the very beginning you step into the familiar halls as soon as you enter you have a brief discussion with the guy at the front who recognizes you and leads you into the office there waiting behind his desk is nostoc who's currently in the process of looking out the window over the entire quarry of his mine he turns over his shoulder looking at the rest of you well i'm surprised to see you all alive just assumed you'd all got yourselves killed like the usual bumpkins who come wandering this far down in the mountain ah yes of course of course understood what was the price we had agreed for that one as a note i'm pretty sure at practically no point in your adventure to the underdark did you ever say you were scalping a creature you completely in the entirety of that adventure didn't collect a single scalp from anything you killed nostoc also looks at you and goes and while i respect your memory a dwarf's mind is like a trap that you can't escape i believe the agreed upon price was 25000 gold pieces i don't even know what you fought if you're going to collect your money tell me what the hell you freaking killed you fought a beholder really and you're all still alive make a deception check beholder you say what else did you encounter a whole city of illithid i know the creatures you speak of i've dealt with my share of duergar though-- make a persuasion check you were spearheading that part of the group scanlan already made his roll no testicle advantage on that roll i'm sorry 11 looking at your number i can see that you've certainly encountered some dangerous things in your travels taken some losses and i will say since you've left we haven't had at least one excursion interrupting our mine which has been very helpful the fact that you've returned with these tales-- i believe most of it i'd say given that circumstance i'd be happy to pay you up to 18000 gold pieces so what's the dc you don't have your hand cone natural one all right what are you suggesting he looks about at the rest of you guys the greyspine name holds weight in this city the last thing i want is that that be sullied by miscommunication if we agreed to 25000 i'll pay 25000 but i hear a single disagreement out there or a bad word that came from your lips about our exchange here and i'm going to come for the rest of that money he looks back at you very slowly as you do this with a tense stare (laughs) all right all right and he starts bringing up coin purse after coin purse after coin purse counting it up as he does it takes him about five minutes or so and eventually he counts out at your vision to improve it 25000 gold pieces and platinum pieces and pushes it across to you guys you've retrieved that no additional funds as no scalps were collected but you do get 25000 you can hold onto that thank you i'm glad and i'm sorry for your losses perhaps you'll be less stupid in the future like an unexpected web pop-up he gives you an expression of where is this coming from get out get out of my office you can do it twice 6th-level spell twice what the teleportation i think it is you're right (sad bear noises) this mournful low guttural groan you're pretty sure it translates to why he licks it off it takes about ten minutes before the keep doors open and the rest of your party returns at this point in the discussion you guys all look up and see sitting in the center of the main foyer area of greyskull a very mighty bear brought down low sitting covered in pink ribbons looking forward going (distressed bear noises) you look over too there are traces of chocolate smears across the face of vax (sad bear noises) he's pulling them out with his claws as best he can trinket stands up and heads out to the front courtyard all right so it's 1500 times seven okay this is probably going to take you the rest of the week it's an extensive project right but it's also the most complicated thing outside of the gun that you've constructed it's up to you probably not everything you'll have to choose between a couple right well that is technically an enchantment oh to start a charge then you can do it okay we can begin the roll now go ahead and make a tinkering roll 20 okay not actually doing the charge yet because you're building the basis of the structure you help him downstairs in his workshop with the various materials to begin crafting the actual shell of the the item what else are you guys doing no they're arriving now in six days and arriving for the actual feast it's to be held in the palace it's with uriel the council which is why you guys were invited also because percy asked and the briarwoods it is partially to discuss and celebrate the agreed-upon construction of a bridge that goes across the shearing channel at the far northeastern side of the continent of tal'dorei there is a large channel where these two large mountain ranges which are the closest the two continents are to each other but it's a very treacherous pass of water so any trade having to be done has had to travel southward in a big arc around the bottom of the island or via skyship both very expensive this bridge will enable a much faster trade route between the two continents and whitestone has essentially been in charge of spearheading the construction of this bridge and making this agreement with uriel that would be overall helpful for both continents and since they've agreed upon this they've been invited here to emon for the first time to have dinner with the council and uriel to celebrate it (laughs) okay that was seeker asum the hat like any minor illusion spell you can choose your appearance i mean you can look pretty close to somebody else you could but as it is an illusion there is no physical-- so if somebody were to reach up and touch your shoulder it would just pass through six six beard checks right that'll cost you 25 gold for 100 okay both have been constructed without question all right debt is paid mark off that gold how many is that by the end of this week you have grown what is a rather majestic full chin-beard you are probably the first goliath to have facial hair it's a full we're talking portland man make a stealth check make a perception check you just broke a mechanical pencil (laughter) sleeping soundly drunk you do not hear the approach of vax as you pull out your blade and get ready i want you to roll a sleight of hand check one thing to not be noticed it's another to shave someone's face without being noticed this is about stillness of fingers not just how stealthy you can be roll a perception check grog with advantage because this is against your face all right the crowing sound of a distant rooster the farmlands that surround the outside of emon which are relatively close within earshot the morning sun rises cresting over the eastern skyline of tal'dorei grog you come to consciousness stretch reach up to rub-- half a beard one side of your face however it is a new morning roll a beard check no movement all right so as a note percy i want you to make four more tinkering rolls what have you got 28 okay second one dice going everywhere d6 is what i gave you all right third one all right and the fourth one okay so over the next few days you've constructed what amounts to a large metallic gauntlet you have taken this gauntlet and wired all through it insulation and metallic insulating tips in what is essentially a small for lack of a better term alternator of some kind the fifth roll's going to be that you have constructed this device the quality seems fair it's untested technology just something that's a brainchild of your own utilizing keyleth's aid keyleth i'm going to have you roll a wisdom check roll that and add five plus six it would be sorry 20 total you step out and you set it down in the middle of the courtyard keyleth you summon a storm that slowly gathers above the top of the keep you guys start hearing sounds like rolling thunder outside and you come and look and you see percy and keyleth are out standing in the middle of the courtyard keyleth with her arm in the air as this black dark storm cloud begins to swirl above the entirety of greyskull keep with that she brings her hand up and then brings her fist down as a bolt of energy (thunder clap) streaks down from the clouds slamming into a small object on the ground that then gets flung about 15 feet in a random direction tumbles to the ground you rush over to grab it you can see arcing over the metal (electric sparking) these small electric arcs you reach over and wait a second you prod it pick it up and it's hot drop it instinctively you give it a few minutes to cool off pick it up when it's warm enough you put it on and there is essentially this large sparking metal centerpiece that is giving off this low hum okay tiberius make a constitution saving throw sam and all right you suffer 14 points of lightning damage and are stunned for a round i need you to go ahead and roll a d20 19 okay it stays intact from the force of it a little bit of the energy that was stored in there appears to dissipate you figure there's only a few applications of this before it needs to be recharged and every single time it's utilized there's a low chance that it may detonate or crumble or something bad may happen you manage to eventually shake off all your muscles that were so locked tense give way for a second let's go ahead and make an animal handling check i say with advantage because trinket's been your companion for so long which is close to what you needed because this is a very difficult feat over the week you've worked with trinket and you've worked on a technique where instead of a multi-attack trinket can do what is essentially a trample attack meaning trinket can roll forward and roll through anything that's equal to or smaller and damage everything in that path we'll go over the logistics of that some other time but trinket has now learned a roly-poly trample attack it's your call call it what you want the trinket cannonball with a 15 and an 18-- yeah okay to hide and to speak to stay did not stick unfortunately you had two rolls that were high enough to get those two in there though hide and speak all right the morning has come to fruition you have a few hours before you're supposed to arrive at the palace you have been notified that this is a very formal event roll again please you manage to construct 20 pieces of ammunition from 20 units of materials you go back to karin you now have some kind of a knife-glaive thing you are unsure how it will work in combat but it looks neat it just hangs to the side careful how you sit you would yes there are actually it in a foreigner in a foreign land kind of way could work that's more of an illusion from a visual standpoint the robe tapers and curls around his form and comes to look like a nicer robe the material looks like it's made of almost a reddish silk the actual imagery of the tapestry slowly fades and becomes just various textures and material from your eyes it's less interesting but from a presentory standpoint it could be passable yeah which by the way you guys do see it's half giant beard and half scrawled-on charcoal the dust tends to glisten and where there was once charcoal outline a mirror to your once beautiful beard continues full as if nothing had happened this creaking metal sound the goblet is now destroyed all right dressed up you all make your way to the cloudtop district as the sun begins to bring itself to the other side of the horizon as you approach the outside of the tal'dorei palace there are general guards set up to accept guests they're just there in wait as part of their process today as soon as you arrive and announce yourselves as having arrived is there anything you want to do to prepare you guys are nearing the palace right now do you guys make yourselves known at the palace front as you approach you make yourselves known the guards lead you to the front area of the palace the sun's just starting to hit the distant side of the water of the ozmit sea to the west of emon as you guys finish talking to the front guard that you've arrived seeker asum steps out of the front of the palace and sees you very good glad you could make it please enter i will wish to speak with you briefly before the event this evening are you missing anyone make a deception check very well that's unfortunate his skills could have been of use to me come inside he leads you into the green meeting room you guys have had previous council meetings with it's currently empty he sets the guards to the side and brings you inside and says all right so if my little birds speak truth they should be arriving around dusk so we probably have no more than 20 minutes before they are here themselves if you're not aware they should be referred to as lord and lady briarwood their names lord sylas briarwood and lady delilah briarwood this is a political dinner please do your best not to cause a scene during the meal as i need that time as a distraction to do my own digging vax you're light of step and quick to fade would you wish to join me on this or stay with the dinner party make a deception check asum goes all right if we are to do this i would appreciate a little bit of honesty at the front point i gathered as much as soon as you began to speak now i can understand based on our previous conversation that you have interest in keeping low key but know that i am an ally in this if you're not here where is the rest of your party where is vax well vax if you can hear me follow me when the meal begins i may have use for you all right so the briarwoods have a very good relationship with uriel and the tal'dorei council established back before they expanded outside of wildemount i've sent two of my best gatherers into wynandir to seek out more information on them i don't know when that information will be available they've only been gone but three days and hopefully in time we'll learn more of what their machinations may be many of the noble houses of whitestone were left vacant when the de rolos passed and were given to friends of the briarwoods whispers that reach me speak of these new nobles not being highborn nor affiliated with the gentry at all so i'm curious as to what allies they've made either before or after taking whitestone for themselves i don't the briarwoods have i do not know yet i've sent folks out there those who have been sent to whitestone have either defected or quit and sent me letters of resignation which is part of the reason i am very curious as to what's going on in whitestone now i've also found the documentation that delivered the ungoverned lands of whitestone to the briarwoods was signed officiated and cataloged months in advance to the de rolo family passing i'm still following the trail but i find the timing far too convenient with their arrival coming up please be controlled remember what i've told you and as more information comes in in the passing weeks i'll bring that to your attention as well be observant listen pry what information you can but do not raise suspicion jenga as you do he looks down at it and goes thank you it's not my color i appreciate the offer but my theme goes with browns and blacks so as not to be seen this is a bit bright for my taste i'm not going to be at the dinner but thank you the only thing i can recall as the information of the briarwoods at least what's come this way was while they were ruling the lands in wildemount as part of their kingdom there lady delilah briarwood was an accomplished practitioner of the arcane arts a long-trained wizard as far as i know and been through quite a few different schools and had a brief stint here in emon training at the lyceum but that was naught but nine ten years back maybe more at which point you hear muffled in the distance a (horn noise) this horn sound that seems to be blown as a notification that the arrival of guests has rolled in asum goes no please none of that vax if you can hear me in this room ten minutes into the meal see if you can spot me and follow me in the foyer good luck asum leaves the room do you wish to stay inside do you wish to see the guests as they arrive all right you guys head back out to the front of the palace the large stairway that leads down into the central road outside of the palace in the middle of the cloudtop district the sky itself has now come to a dark purple blue slowly moving over into the distant sunset the sun has disappeared beneath the sea and you've completed the dusk as the sunset slowly turns gold a dark wood carriage flanked by four armored men on horseback pulls onto the road right before the tal'dorei palace a young man steps from the front of the carriage and opens the door stepping out you see a strong tall man in the nearby lantern light short brown hair frames a very chiseled and handsome face adorned with a well groomed goatee his clothing is based in blue and black fitted elegance trimmed with golds and red a strip of grey fur cresting over one shoulder framing his torso he turns extends his hand towards the door where a feminine gloved hand finds it a beautiful woman steps out after her hair dark auburn and pulled up into a tight braided bun resembling some sort of a glamorous school teacher almost her gown is in the same color scheme as the man if a bit heavier blue than black and a long billowing skirt tapers up to be form-fitted across her body continuing upward to wrap her neck nearly to the jaw they both turn to face the greeting party bowing slightly as two of their companion guards flank their approach up the steps the other two helping the young man who steered the carriage carry their rather large bags behind them this is lord sylas briarwood and lady delilah briarwood as you guys are standing here at this point stepping behind you a hand reaches over and touches the back of your shoulder you look behind you and there smiling is arcanist allura vysoren dressed in a very fine blue gown you've never seen her quite so formal but very beautiful type thing she glances over the shoulders it's so good to see you i'm so glad you all could make it she gives a little hug too glances over at you a pleasure vax'ildan what are you doing as you guys are having this discussion about 15 feet from you the briarwoods enter the palace their guards enter with them there's been no pleasantry and very much an intended arrival none of you are recognizable to them thus they make no intent of introducing themselves they appear to be looking about and taking in their surroundings but they're both engaged in a mumbled conversation between the two of them as they enter as you follow where they're going as you walk into the main foyer area where you stand there waiting carefully at the back there are a number of servants that have arrived and have taken some of their bags and help them up the stairs there is one the head servant who is there talking to them and you hear him speaking to them wait in your quarters be ready the meal should be ready within the hour if you would be so kind as to prepare yourselves relax unwind set up your rooms you're to stay for a few days at the very least but we shall call you when the meal is ready at which lord sylas briarwood turns to him and says i greatly appreciate the information just come to our room and let us know when the food is ready now come my dear okay perception check perception check for you as well oh you do that's true okay good to know 19 no they all appear to be run of the mill soldiers nothing no one that catches your attention the young man who is helping them as they go through seems familiar but no one that is jumping out at you right now someone you may have crossed paths with in the past but nobody that's really been formally involved in your life previously maybe a denizen of whitestone that you've crossed before when he was younger as they walk up the steps you keep an eye best you can as they go you catch a little bit of conversation that seems to speak about how long the journey's been that's all right we'll be in there soon to discuss and we'll be out as soon as we can we won't stay any longer than we need to and that's the extent you gather as they continue up the stairway as the next hour or so passes okay do you want to talk with allura okay she's grateful for the conversation she laughs and she's very attentive to all of you and excited to see you she lets you know that she's been caught in a little bit of the bureaucracy in the city and despises that she's taken some time off for herself for about a week or so of course no of course tiberius well that's very flattering tiberius i appreciate the invitation i would say that particular mix of company might prove a bit awkward perhaps we might-- i mean if you would like to get some tea sometime i'd be more than happy to-- yes kima's quite a ways off and i believe she's still in vasselheim last i spoke with her and yes tea would be lovely the carriage as far as you see is being led off slowly by the servants to a side area of the palace two of them are with the briarwoods and there are two helping to bring their stuff up to their rooms the four are with them yes looking about the council is roughly stepping in and out of the area like they're getting ready for the dinner and arriving from the cloudtop district go ahead and make an insight roll both of you guys the two of you scanning over looking over there is lord riskel daxio he's an elven male who was the one who is master of trade of the city he's the one that handled the ordering of your keep when you first had it brought to your attention by uriel allura of course tofor brotorus is there the female dragonborn paladin she seems generally just not happy about the whole scenario and she's not armored she's dressed in what would be considered formal attire but it's not a dress it's not a suit it's this asexual formal outfit that looks like a robe but also like a suit and she does not look to be happy in it at all just arms crossed at the far end back against the wall just (growling noises) slowly stewing not wanting to be there you also see arbiter brom goldhand who is the master of law was previously one of the heads of the guard there within emon and then was then given the job of being the head of the watchful hall he's the master of law essentially in the city that's right tofor is the master of defense that took over for krieg after krieg was slain so those are the council members most everyone else there you see are servants as time goes on eventually there is the ringing of a dinner bell down the hallway and everyone turns their head and notices and steps over to the great hall of the palace where the feast is to be given to you and other guests all righty so you rejuvenate the invisibility spell you're escorted to the hall by allura she keeps chatting with you guys and asking questions about how vasselheim was and is kima well she stayed back there she asks questions about why pike isn't here and you tell her the story that she stayed behind and everything you make your way into the great hall which seats a vast number of people there are five major tables meant for like large feasts but there is one central square table in the far end that is by this giant hearth this fireplace is probably a good six feet high and about 12 feet wide it's a grandiose visual on the far end of this hall and there's a long table right there set for about 20 people you don't know if there will be that many there at the table but it can seat that many at which point all the different members of the council have their seats around it you guys find your seats with this many seats set it's hard to tell but you gather that they're probably going to sit-- there are no place cards but there are two ends of the table that have two chairs at each end certainly you can probably sit on the center or the far end of the table looking in their direction should be fine okay but adjacent to it okay fair enough they do have adjustments for gnomish guests-- is a way of putting it all right after you guys sit for a few moments another servant steps forward and says please if we might rise for our guests lord and lady briarwood to join us at the table-- lord and lady briarwood now enter arm in arm slowly walking from the far end of the great hall they make their way to one end of the table they both wordlessly sit down smiling and acknowledge everyone at the table there's a moment of silence and then another servant says and would all please attention be given to our sovereign uriel tal'dorei the second and the empress salda tal'dorei at which point the sovereign and his wife enter from the same entrance point everyone stands up from their chair waits for them to get to the edge of the table at which point they nod their head everyone gives a low bow you guys follow suit following the social graces you're not familiar with but trying to learn as you go except for tiberius you know this deal you all follow his lead on this eventually everyone sits down again tables are pushed in by servants behind you you're like 'oh' caught off guard by the whole experience uriel looks about the table with a smile shoulder length brown hair and his chin goatee very well crafted into almost a point now he looks about the table thank you lord and lady briarwood for making the journey across the lands so that we might meet in person finally please allow me to introduce our dining party and esteemed council of tal'dorei he goes around the table introducing arbiter brom goldhand he is the master of law of our city and is responsible for maintaining all of these grand people of our fair town in the realm of safety and order we have lord riskel daxio he is our head of planning and construction has overseen many of the expansions of the city and is a trusted friend of mine we have the arcanist allura vysoren one of my trusted advisors one of the greatest arcane minds of all of tal'dorei and the overseer of all things arcane within our city we have the guardian tofor brotorus a fierce warrior and currently the master of defense in our city and hopefully for a long time to come tofor gives a (scoffs) sound and everyone is put off by it but they're also seemingly used to it arbiter brom goldhand master of law my lovely wife the empress salda we have here within our midst as well vox machina a team of intrepid adventurers who rose up and saved my family's life and very well the city of emon and have since proven very useful to our territory grog strongjaw a goliath of interesting dress but strong of heart and blade we have vex'halia half-elven maiden with a bow as swift as the fastest eagle looking next he says we have here vax'ildan blades quick and eyes sharp not a whisper passes his ear ah there you are scanlan shorthalt a performer known far and wide a wit as clever as you've ever seen his songs are whispered through taverns across the land we have tiberius stormwind-- hailing from draconia which he looks across to the briarwoods the kingdom you hail from originally not being far off from draconia perhaps you've had some dealings with the stormwinds and the briarwoods give a nod yes we have seen them in the past we've heard many good things we have over here keyleth of the ashari if i am correct on that she is a denizen of the natural lands and protector of all things nature within tal'dorei there was one more anyway welcome and thank you he reaches over and takes a small glass and clinks it with his silverware the servants immediately muster up and start pulling glasses out and pouring wine into everyone's glasses and the conversation begins to naturally bustle about for this meal immediately conversation builds in about uriel talking across to the briarwoods talking about the bridge he says now the uriel bridge i don't think the name was necessary but it's appreciated from my perspective now in this union between wildemount and tal'dorei-- do we have a confirmed trade route between the two at which lord briarwood returns this is indeed very true we are hoping that through this passageway we'd have means of rather quick trade between this kingdom and yours not to mention this would allow for individuals to travel for carried parcels very quickly and we're hoping to establish perhaps a very quick means of communication outside of the arcane for those who cannot afford these various luxuries lady briarwood taps on his shoulder and says yes and by the way i don't mean to bring up a sore subject but it's come to our attention that apparently last winter's crest there was an attempt on your life and the table gets a little quiet for a second we're sorry to hear that and wish to express our-- uriel puts his hand out and says no no it's quite all right it was but a paltry attempt and it was thwarted actually by vox machina they have been tremendous in keeping us safe and i greatly appreciate their aid in overseeing my family's good fortune yes they are seated right next to each other at the head of one table across the way what's behind them is just open space and servants there's probably a good 25 servants here that are just like sitting there patiently lying in wait for-- and tables there's like other unused tables in this great hall that are just out there four other ones to inquire about-- okay go for it it's hard to tell from this distance really at all they're very charming you were expecting this very dour dark evil couple from all the conversation but they seem nice they seem earnest they keep to themselves definitely they're definitely a very tight couple but nothing about them catches you off guard as being anything instinctively twisted you're saying this out loud the conversation comes to a halt she-- yes of course i'm so sorry what was your name again vex'ahlia absolute pleasure to meet you delilah we hail from wildemount it's quite a ways from here the continent to the far east you should come by sometime we haven't been home in a number of years having to tend to whitestone but we have quite an elaborate homestead there we'd love to have you come stay with us if you ever find yourself in that side of the world we've been at whitestone for the better part of-- i can't even remember and lord briarwood looks he goes best i can recall four or five years it was an unfortunate mantle to pick up but we've done what we can in honor of the passed de rolo family we unfortunately do not it seems it was not in the cards for us to bear however we consider many of our esteemed servants and house guests our extended family so we can leave a legacy however we can possibly do so certainly 18 seems pretty earnest i'm sorry i-- he snaps and a servant moves a large like pig platter out of the way that was blocking your head from his vision yes actually dr ripley is one of our esteemed physicians in whitestone yes recently come into some land herself although she has been on holiday for some time following her own research as doctors are wont to do i wouldn't say close but she's been a friend at times and she was one of the few that came with us from wildemount over to whitestone and has helped us restructure and maintain and help facilitate the blossoming of a city without a leader jeff shorthalt i will be happy to pass that along at which point one of the other council members goes um and puts his hand out it's all right and he pats the hand of his wife he looks over at you with a smile we know not if it is connected with the disease but before all this occurred we became very close friends with the de rolo family about ten or so years ago actually the first time we met is an interesting tale if you want to tell it please his wife goes all right all right so they were taking a brief vacation east to wildemount apparently they had not traveled and they brought their family with them a whole gaggle of small children they were coming this direction now our homestead is on the western outskirts of wildemount so one of the first places you traverse before going into the kingdom proper however the family the de rolo family had been caught in a bad downpour a storm that had blown in and made travel rather impossible and apparently they stopped not far from our homestead they came to our front door asking for shelter for the evening and we were happy to house them we gave them dry clothes food for the night and well a rather fast friendship was forged as we quickly began to notice they weren't just rabble of the street they themselves were highborn as we were and in a very dire circumstance so we let them in they stayed for but a week we showed them about the western side of wildemount and let them on their way and since then we've had many different years we've spent together as families going on various journeys and trips together but as time went on we got busy on our own and separate ways and we hadn't spoken in a while they were in the process of discussing the building of the uriel bridge about five years ago and we were going to meet with them about pursuing this venture as a joint-- well when the disease took them the family passed on we were surprised that they would've considered leaving whitestone in our name and we couldn't say no at this point to carry on their legacy i felt was important enough let alone the memory of that to carry on the building of this uriel bridge i thought i really wanted to spearhead the wishes of frederick a toast to gracious hosts so uriel and he looks across the way and says one of our largest exports in whitestone is timber from the forests and woods that surround whitestone and the alabaster sierras we've had a rising danger in the surrounding woods it has made it proven difficult to export most of these wooded goods if it is possible we would like for you to send some aid perhaps a small band of soldiers to lead a strike into the woods uriel looks across the way and says ah yes we can definitely discuss that i don't see why not we are currently in peacetime and we have a reserve of soldiers we can send your way as the meal continues on more conversations arise a lot of bureaucratic bs anyone want to interject anything or ask any questions allura is there yes allura looks glances over to the side and says yes it's been completed no one's come by to take it from me and as a note i'm about a month away from completing the sigil in the base mentof your keep i prefer a mint or jasmine to be honest you step up and walk away from the dinner table (chair scraping) tiberius stands up in the middle of the discussion and walks away from the feast well thank you this is the first time we've been away from whitestone in many years perhaps you seem strong of build and-- that is an impressive feat young keyleth slain a beholder uriel you keep in the presence of some mighty heroes uriel goes (chuckles) they are proven allies i mean if you utilize their assistance that would be very possible may have something coming up that i could use them for myself but we'll discuss in time nevertheless the meal continues she smiles and looks back at you you can make an insight check sure you're distracted by the pattern the brocade across her torso area what are you checking for make an arcana check it's not so much something you can sense more than you can look for symbols you rolled a 17 it looks like there are elements of their accoutrements that are like any of you are carrying on yourselves there's a choker that's part of the outfit that lady briarwood wears that itself does appear to have some tiny enchantment-based markings across it they are adorned in various protective magic but so is everybody else at the table they look at each other and give a sorrowful look we do not know we were only given the information that the family had passed but a month or two after it had already occurred most of the castle seemed to have fallen to it as well uriel says my condolences by the way i understand that's very hard it's all right the least we could do is try to carry on their legacy it's appreciated he looks at his wife and she looks up for a second it's all right there was worry of such a thing but before whitestone castle could be entered we made sure to send in our best clerics to rid of any existing possible lingering disease and to make sure to remove any corpses or bodies that may contain it there was a period of time that we were worried but after a few months we came to the conclusion that we were safe and thus we moved our way in at this point the dessert has been brought out it's a fine almost creme brulee-type dish it's delicious as part of the discussions there are a few side exchanges here and there the best you can make from it is did you notice him she says yes don't worry and tonight we'll stay and those are the only things you can make out from the exchanges back and forth well after this dinner i imagine a few days and we'll be on our way we're merely here to finalize the paperwork for the bridge construction she looks over and gives a nod to lord daxio who gives her a nod back and maybe see the city for a while and make our way back it's too hard to be away and our nephew has been left in charge of this that would be lovely where are you staying what's it called greyskull keep we will have you sent for when the time is right oh well it's hard to show you this here what you need to see is the wildemount fashion district it is divine the meal has been now wound down the dishes are being gathered by the servants the wine has stopped being poured and now everyone settles in with sighs of a meal well spent the other council members begin to excuse themselves uriel stands up and says my apologies me and my wife find that rest is in our future please feel free to walk the halls as you see fit thank you again lord and lady briarwood for joining us and we're excited to continue this venture good night to you all asum he's not in the room he's been waiting in the foyer for you lord and lady briarwood also stand up on that note as well i think our meal has come to an end we appreciate your-- and lady briarwood continues the sentence and we wish you all a fine night-- they both sit and watch for a moment-- you make your way out and he's not there you don't see him anywhere okay you double back after about a minute of this yes well thank you kindly for that wondrous display i feel that sleep takes us and we are going to retire to our quarters have a wonderful night everyone yes yes and good night and they both stand up and then they make their way out through the main great hall exit okay you gather across the ceiling as you go you watch them head up the stairway to the second floor they head to the right down a long hallway a series of doors they come up to a door where there are two guards standing outside the same guards that led them inside the building and were riding on horseback hunter's mark is technically a minor spell you could try it i'd say make a stealth check trying to do this subtly at the table you hunter's mark which one okay you mark delilah as she walks off you have a sense of where she is at all times in the vicinity as you follow them they go to the door the guards open the door for them and lead them into their room and then close the door not against it but immediately to the right and left of it all right you take it and you throw the snake let me check one thing on invisibility real fast just because-- attacks or casts a spell it's not either of those it's activating an item you take the belt (whoosh) fling it (hissing) the snake appears to the side one of the guards looks over looks over at the other guard he pulls out his weapon and one of the guards steps over to where the serpent is and starts trying to stomp it out and it nips up and gets some of the armor and he's just stomping out the snake about 25 feet away yeah yeah okay all right as you leap off the top you (whoosh) land on the ground go ahead and roll an attack and he is surprised because he does not know you're there right okay go ahead and roll sneak attack damage 62 damage will do it you (whack) right to the side of the helmet with a dull (thud) sound just falls like a sack of potatoes right against the wall the door is currently not locked you can see the guard you just knocked out had the key in his hand and was in the process of going to lock the door right when that happened okay so (creak) you open the door and enter the room closing it behind you as soon as you enter the room it's a large guest room there are two windows across the way with curtains drawn to the side you can see the darkness of the night sky behind that and the rest of the low-lit cloudtop district visible and the courtyard surrounding the palace immediately to the right and left of you you see two large tables that are covered in black cloths that are just tables to be you know vases and stuff set up on them one's clean one has actual decor on it there are two wooden tables immediately to the right and left of you there's a large red rug central to the floor that is circular and on the far corners next to the two windows you see armoires like dressers for clothing and such in the center of the room you see on top of the rug against the wall between the two windows is a large canopy bed very beautifully carved from dark wood has a purple cloth silk canopy that drifts down around it and on the far end you can see now against one of the tables is lady briarwood is currently taking jewelry off of one of her arms while lord briarwood is right by the bed holding on to the post like he's just walked over to that area they're both at the bed they're both looking in your direction make a deception check 11 lord briarwood goes oh well that's all right not to worry in no serious rush isn't that right my dear and she looks over she stops taking her jewelry off and turns yes yes of course as you a man who works for the city what do you do for the city if i may ask they both step a little bit closer looking at you-- right lady briarwood goes you look strangely similar to a gentleman we just had dinner with it's uncanny how similar you look (arcane chanting) you get to make a wisdom save is what you do you turn to move and your muscles (crunching) tense up as you're unable to physically move you're halfway through the doorway stuck in place as she keeps walking forward now giving you a curious look lord briarwood comes and flanks you from the other side (clicks tongue) you try and flee i'm merely asking you questions come let us discuss in more private quarters and you feel the hand of lord briarwood slam onto your other shoulder don't worry you look delicious and he pulls you into the room as she closes the door behind and that's where we're going to end tonight's session (screaming) that was a very slow tension building episode that turned very interesting at the end how you doing taliesin (laughs) that'd be rough well cool we'll all be picking up that next week on thursday all right guys so we got a lot of awesome donations tonight let's go ahead and rock through those as you shouldn't that got really interesting really fast
