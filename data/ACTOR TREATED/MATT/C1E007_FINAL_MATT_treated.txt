hello and welcome to this evening's episode of critical role we'll be with you in just a second unfortunately we're down a travis willingham tonight but in grog's stead we have the rest of the party venturing forth into the emberhold after just recently discovering lady kima we shall see what happens very shortly but in the meantime let's go ahead and give you guys some character backstory we are missing him terribly we'll see what terrors will transpire in his absence however though we do have some fun things to announce real fast first off we're still giving away promo kits for every 50 subscribers we get so we'll be having those randomly drawn from everyone in the chat room every time 50 subscribers are joined to the channel i guess you would say also every ten subscribers we're giving away steam keys for different games so also cool giveaways which is kind of fun i want to take a moment also to mention our charity there that's the word i was looking for it's been a long day (laughter) d10s technically no you're right i saw the wrong side of it my apologies forget i said anything indeed so fantastic i may have some more stuff down the road we'll be able to talk about but in the meantime let's go ahead and get everyone caught up to speed with what has transpired recently on critical role so the party to give you a quick overview for those who have just joined us they were given a mission to seek out a female halfling paladin named lady kima of vord who had been missing going on a vision quest apparently seeking some deep dark evil that had begun to simmer and grow beneath the dwarven city of kraghammer the party managed to make their way to the city delve deep within its caverns to discover an entire series of caves and what eventually led to the underdark itself a subterranean landscape of terror and darkness after a series of battles with some duergar which are kinda ashy-skinned evil dwarven offshoot people characters and a few brushes with some illithids or mind flayer creatures they managed to befriend one or i should say ally with one named clarota who has been traveling with them who has apparently been kicked away from his society and wishes reentry to save them from the kind of ominous presence of this unseen barely spoken entity called k'vorn k'varn (laughter) (laughs) i know i know (laughter) i know but yes so they have now after a series of battles found their way into the magma-covered kind of obsidian jagged caverns where the emberhold the duergar fortress currently resides where they believe lady kima was upon finding a way in unfortunately announcing their presence to the fortress itself they managed to find lady kima in a torture chamber beneath emberhold save her slay her oppressor and now they have after a tenuous alliance was made-- as lady kima and their mind-flayer friend clarota are very much at odds-- a very tenuous alliance was forged and they now journey back up to the main basement floor or main base floor of the emberhold proper and that's where we left off last time so hope you can absorb all that guys (laughs) correct you're trying to find essentially-- lady kima has mentioned she wants to find the rest of her equipment that she says is either in an armory or she mentioned a vault and also she knows-- she mentioned something about vengeance to those who run the keep so she stormed up you've followed her back into the base floor of the emberhold itself you all currently are now back kinda where you started after you snuck into the side passage of the emberhold certainly everyone go ahead and make an immediate perception roll later two that's a fail all right so-- you've got to be ready okay (laughter) nearly at the ready all right so as you all take a moment and kind of steel yourselves your ears perk up and you can hear what sounds like echoes of distant footsteps down hallways far out of sight you hear some movement across the stone ceiling above you that eventually comes to a stop and you wait for about a minute and the entire place is now in a very eerie silence kima turns to you her eyes still peering back and she's creeping towards the edge of the hallway she looks back at you briefly and says i've only seen half of this stronghold before they captured me as far as i know probably somewhere on the second floor the ground floor apparently there were stairs-- right there no there were stairs going up in the first room you entered okay go ahead and roll stealth 29 all right she begrudgingly steps back you can see there's that eagerness to get in some sort of a fray or to feel somebody else bash along the side of this greatsword that she borrowed from you guys she lets you pass you creep up along the edge as you do you see-- back here there is in the middle of this hallway a series of doorways and what looks to be a large room in the center of the chamber where two duergar currently stand this is another hallway no it's pretty dark in here like with low light vision you're able to see maybe a good 30 to 40 feet ahead of you there are a few of those red crystal clusters that give off a little bit of light incrementally but duergar themselves you've gotten to the point where you see they like it very very dark they actually aren't needing light this is more of a courtesy to guests they may have all right as you step past you do see this room here is a little ajar the inside looks to be a storage room there's just a series of boxes barrels and various-- all right you glare down the side of this hallway it leads to two other smaller rooms down the way with a split towards the back end there does not appear to be anybody visible in that hall all right so you go past this way now this hallway there appears to be an opening to this room no doorway and this additional room you do not currently see an entrance i mean there isn't a door in the way it's just an opening perception roll 20 you take a moment and listen you hear what sounds like a light crackling of some sort of a fire and the occasional dull ring of metal being hit against metal all right peeking through you do see indeed it is some sort of a smithy with two kilns or two anvils set up a work table in the center and there is one lone duergar that apparently in the middle of his work has not been paying attention to any of the ruckus going on around and is just in the middle of hitting some sort of long thick piece of black iron and it's just (ting ting) sweat dripping down the front of his brow the room itself is-- even against the corner of the doorway you can tell the temperature is a lot warmer on the inside it's kinda to the side to you he's currently looking-- working out the anvil banging down yes you haven't had a short rest yet and you do-- you feel the oppressive force of clarota's voice in your heads simultaneously say i can also accompany all right so mark off your next invisibility spell as you vanish clarota also kind of waves his hand for a moment and his image disappears the same way scanlan's did apparently as you're humming to yourself-- you make your way down and eventually towards the back of where vax is pressed against the-- okay all right all right go ahead and roll for an attack that's how you start the game all righty so go ahead and roll damage this is a sneak attack as he didn't-- it was not aware you were there all right you don't multiply the modifier the modifier goes on at the end so it's the dice roll plus your sneak attack multiplied by two and then the dex modifier at the end plus seven i think right at the end and then add the plus seven at the end splitting hairs here that's enough so so you hear this 'tink tink tink' (pause) that's it without even a guttural noise the dagger buries itself in the base of his skull you see him just (grunts) and slump down to the ground kima at this point-- you can see her hand kind of tensing around the sword as she looks back at grog whose hands are also wringing his greataxe i want to kill something she kind of backs off to the side and sees the other duergar that are there and she's going to go ahead and run around you know you guys are telling a very very angry woman right now to be patient doesn't seem to make a ruckus over to here all righty trinket who hasn't seen you in a while is sticking to your back okay trinket is enjoying the petting all right so that duergar's down the current armory section appears to be completely open and at your disposal there are a series of partially made weapons kind of scattered in a pile there are some ingots and even some raw iron material in the far corner other than that it just looks like your general smithing workshop kima is currently looking around this section with you guys she glances around goes and move some of the piles by turning over the room as quietly as she can-- not as quietly as you'd like-- but quiet enough no nothing's here she glares in the direction of your voice this will do me just fine for now right let's keep looking she leaves the room she starts heading down this way-- okay for everyone else stealth check disadvantage on you pike because of your heavy armor roll twice take the lower they're both concentration spells you can have one or the other mage hand isn't an actual object unfortunately okay and where are you casting it just in the middle of this hallway here here there is no entrance to this room currently from what you can see it's just a wall there is a door on the opposite side all right so what was your stealth roll 17 roll for trinket add his dex modifier trinket's dex modifier all right as you guys are making your way down the hallway slowly-- you guys make your way down here one of the duergar glances over-- -- utters something to the friend at his side and he goes-- okay trinket moves past you move behind the bear you are right there and they both see you as you're walking behind trinket all this transpires simultaneously right and they saw the bear and then saw something move behind it their attention was got they see you and they start walking towards-- however as they pass there you get one shot at this guy as he passes past you go ahead and make your attack okay (laughs) tiberius waves at them unfortunately the space is a little limited for your size you have to wait for the rest of them to let you by you're a big cat right now 15 15 does barely hit as you go ahead move around the corner and fire two arrows all right second one same guy or different targets both hit go ahead and roll damage on both okay so as you watch them both walk past you one of them continues past with his hammer out rushing towards whatever he sees moving at the end of the hallway probably tiberius after trinket the next one that comes past you you reach around and just take your dagger and swing it across the back of his neck area you manage to sever the base of the spine and he just crumples into a pile in front of you the other one-- damage both arrows impact his chest the duergar steps back for a second surprised by the moment looks really furious and begins to step forward his size enlarging all right go ahead and make a stealth check to see whether or not he sees you not for this point this is an active combat okay so you still get the attack but you don't have advantage 'cause he's aware you're there as he's running past you he glances and sees you in the corner of his eye and is preparing for the blows go ahead and roll your attack you're hitting it with the blunt go ahead and roll a d20 and add your strength modifier and four all right so go ahead and roll damage it is a 1d4 plus your strength modifier correct yes well it's five on there right okay so that's five times two is ten plus one 11 points of damage which will do it as the duergar sees you is rushing past with his hammer about to fall back and swing at you you rush out from behind the corner with the blunt end of your weapon and just whack him in the side of the temple unconscious on the ground alive but unconscious he's incapacitated if you'd like to okay pike walks up and grabs the back of the duergar's hair holds it back and using the jagged edge of her mace of disruption tears open the throat of the duergar which then spills all this blackish ichor across the ground grog looks impressed but also slightly worried as the man who grew up alongside you all right so that happened the leather armor that she wore is a full torso-covering leather armor piece i apologize sorry scanlan she is-- yeah which by the way i mean it's not just so much the fact that pike did it it's the fact that pike did it by running a jagged blade-edged mace across someone's throat it was less of a slice and more of a-- we'll see we'll find out so given this case now the rest of the party is able to move forward this hallway now you can only see about that far down with the current light source you can see kima is now moving across-- she's wearing leather armor she's not very noisy right now okay as you do so she kinda stops and looks back over her shoulder and gives a begrudging nod but you can see she's-- there's shaking her hand holding the greatsword is currently shaking with rage all right so coasting down this hallway it leads down to an open doorway and a closed doorway immediately to your right and then the room to-- actually the doorway's to your left and to the right you see another wall to another room that you don't have a doorway currently available correct okay go ahead and make a perception check i'm gon' kill all you you put your ear to the side and you hear nothing okay yup so the door itself does not appear to be trapped it does appear to be locked though that's okay it's a really really really crappy lock you notice that the door itself it has a locking mechanism on it it was kinda half-locked and as you push it opens up into a commode there's nobody in there it is a room with what looks almost like a bench with a series of holes cut into the bench it's a communal-- okay it's concentration for quite some time i believe grog helps out you guys move the two bodies slowly over into the restroom area okay as they're both generally laying back like they just got really drunk and barely found their way to the toilet it's really rough blockage okay all right that's not a worry you bring that up to that little area there all right you guys move forward to that grog has come over here to be able to help now looking down this hallway here you can see-- this side opens up-- looking into this room it appears to be a barracks a room that is just filled with different beds all apparently empty from what you can see sure so you slowly approach the door using your keen senses which opens up this hallway a little bit visibly to you you can see it goes back quite a bit sniffing this room you can tell that there were duergar there recently apparently at the moment though there is no immediate scent that matches a duergar so the room for the most part has been completely evacuated as you look to your right this is a large foyer-type area with two red carpets that are rolled on the sides of it that lead to the front of the main double-sided large ten-foot-tall stone doors of the front of the fortress to your left there is a double wooden door about eight feet tall each side about five feet wide that are currently closed leading into whatever this large chamber is immediately to your left there are two doors actually both closed make a perception check listening in you don't hear any noise all right listening in-- as you listen back there is no noise internally except for the slight squeak as you put yourself against the door it shifts a little bit making no noticeable noise but it appears the doors are unlocked or there is no lock you're not hearing anything from inside that one door you're at no you hear no noise coming from that room you have to have sight unfortunately i mean you could peek very low okay you open the door it appears to be some sort of a guest bedroom it's a singular bed that's in much better condition than the barracks it's empty it's well-made it's more lit than the other rooms it seems to be a room that's designed for either non-duergar riff-raff or general soldiers or guests or people that would come to the fortress to stay so all right for this you're already stealthed so as you glance inside the room you see what appears to be a great hall of some kind there are large wooden tables there is a fire pit in the center that has a number of mostly burned wood that is mainly just small darkened embers with a little bit of glowing yellow and red to it there are stools scattered about the room you can see there are remnants of some of a meal that hasn't been fully cleaned up yet on some of the tables but the room appears to be empty you do see a slight glimmer across the way on one of the tables all right everyone else what are you doing okay snoop in the barracks you push your way through excuse me excuse me pardon me pushing through everybody down this hallway okay all right you see slowly as you move down this hallway to check it out a secondary set of barracks that are also apparently empty you see a secondary commode that is open and as you glance around the corner as the light passes by you see there are two duergar currently coming down the hallway this direction okay as you creep back you hear footsteps coming your way quickly oh inside the door there okay the rest of you guys you can glance there's still a hallway around that way if you wanted to go around okay so you move around-- trinket follows up behind makes your way up there scanlan you staying in that room okay well you're in mid-process this is all happening very quickly okay because of your little legs you get about that far your little legs carry you (sighs) (grunting and laughter) okay so tiberius as you're backing up both the duergar turn around immediately seeing you and rear back with javelins throwing them directly at you okay go ahead and roll initiative real fast to see who gets off first what what why didn't you count it okay all right so you go ahead and cast blur you guys see as tiberius comes running back (startled sounds) he manages to cast a spell really fast as two javelins come flying towards him his visible image begins to actually blur the outline looks almost like there's two mirror images of tiberius in the same place that are both shimmering and preventing them from actually telling where he's actually standing the first javelin comes in at a 14 second one comes in at a 17 oh sorry no it's a four 'cause it has disadvantage so both javelins just whish past looks like they pierced part of that kinda shimmering blurring form but both just ricochet off the walls of stone and come clattering to the ground kinda near back where kima and grog are they both step out of the way as they land all right so that brings us to-- that was your action who else wants to take the next action it's kinda dark and you can see movement in the distance you can try all right so you hop on the back of trinket (laughs) looking over the top and you know grog is kinda blocking part of your view but you can see with your low-light vision what looks to be tiberius' form shimmering and two duergar-height individuals that are partially blocked by him so they do have partial cover or three-quarters cover do you have the feat that ignores that (laughs) because you don't know i'm going to say no yeah it would be called sharpshooter is the feat okay yeah so go ahead and roll for attack on one or both duergar up to you okay okay the 21 misses the 23 hits because they have cover and because it's so dark it's difficult to make out their form but you do manage to hit one with the arrow okay next time make sure you do that before you attack otherwise it won't count for the attack (laughs) all right there you go 12 then add your hunter's mark bonus to that as well all right gotcha so one arrow sinks in the shoulder but doesn't appear to be stopping his angry advance towards tiberius let's see you're staying where you are all right you guys are actually kind of like pinched off in the hallway right here so as you guys are all kind of-- -- as you're doing this tiberius you're right there the two duergar catch up to you and both now that their javelins are out of their hands pull out their hammers with their bonus actions and come down at you with an attack each that's gonna be a six and a 17 okay yeah that blur is saving you man all right so as the one-- both the duergar are kinda like swelling with frustration anger it's an ability you've now gotten to the point where you can see these duergar can actually temporarily increase their form for stronger blows and attacks comes and strikes you for 12 points of bludgeoning damage as the hammer comes cracking down finding purchase on your torso and it kinda pushes you back a few inches that's gonna bruise tomorrow morning he'd probably agree with you what do you wanna do how are you going to communicate this to grog i'm gonna have to say unfortunately that's not gonna work out for this moment grog's attention is on the duergar and you are a giant cat all right just a second there you're still holding let's finish keyleth so keyleth what are you doing grog is there you can attempt to leap over grog you can do that without asking him no you were saying you wanted to tell grog you were going to do that but yes you can still do it so go ahead and roll an acrobatics check yes from around the corner you pull back leap up jump onto grog's back and attempt to spring off of it 11 okay (laughs) all right so you jump off of grog's back grog not expecting it instinctively ducks down and the force you push off as he's not aware there's going to be a giant cat there-- -- in doing so it doesn't give you the momentum you need you are able to jump over him and get kind of into center of the fray but you do not have the pounce attack unfortunately but it gets you there at least you can attack yeah go for it okay this is the one that took the arrow from laura 17 that hits go ahead and roll for damage ten piercing damage all right so as you rush forward you bite at him you see he pulls back but you get a big meaty chunk of his forearm and clamp down and you feel a snap some sort of bone in the middle of his arm and he gives out a horrible-- (yells) sound as he takes the butt of his hammer and hits you on the snout doesn't do any damage but it's enough to get you to kind of let go of your grip a little bit and he rips his arm out of your jaws leaving that kind of nasty irony taste of duergar blood that you've now become accustomed to unfortunately that ends the round now you have tiberius and a cat in your way the doors go in okay as you step out (fwip) that does hit you do not get sneak attack bonus unfortunately you do if you are in melee with them you get the bonus if you're both like flanking them or you're like harrying them in combat because you're at a distance you don't get the bonus all right all right go ahead and roll damage on the second dagger which is 1d4 plus what nine okay so after the guy rips his arm out of keyleth's face essentially a dagger comes swinging out from behind the doorway stabs him in the other shoulder you see he looks down at it confused for a second and as that dagger vanishes in a puff of dark smoke returning to your-- the side of your hilt he looks up just in time to see the second dagger catch him right in the middle of the forehead and he just falls onto his back at that point unmoving that duergar is stripped who's up next who wants to do anything who hasn't done anything yet this action you're just finishing sorry so pike have you done anything yet you move around here there is a door over here yes the door is a secondary guest room it is a guest room of equal design and dressing as the one that scanlan you are unaware is currently fouling (laughter) you can do what you want be aware pike as a character has her intent the more you stray from that the more it will have ramifications for her in the end that's about as far as you're able to move you can still use your action if you wanted to do anything but right now your vision is currently fairly well-blocked by a woman and a bear and a man the size of a bear okay so that brings us back to kima who currently doesn't have any sort of way of getting over there kind of frustrating trying to find a way over clarota who is still invisible is just gonna hold on that point okay percy stand there all right tiberius you're up do it quick or we are gonna move for the next turn okay point-blank firebolt go ahead and roll your spell attack 20 all right that'll hit go ahead and roll for damage for the firebolt 23 damage all right so as you instinctively pull back you release the blast of firebolt energy the duergar who is currently harrying you with this warhammer takes the brunt of it right to the bottom of his face and his torso the studded leather armor that he's wearing tears open with a sheer flaming burst of the impact of it and you see most of his skin is charred and burned at that point he reels back for a second looking very very hurt but not quite put down yet all right the second blast as he reaches back before he can get a chance to get back to his feet the second blast hits this time it sends him off his feet flying about five to ten feet back skidding across the ground yes and that puts him still on the floor laid out with a burning kind of crippling crispy scent in the air of what was once a standing duergar now dead and burning on the ground all right as you guys are doing this scanlan steps out of the guest room getting his pantaloons back on yes you hear the footprints of scanlan you being still invisible you essentially just-- you found a fun way to prank duergar over there no go ahead and roll again (laughter) okay as you push the door open and get a glance inside of the main hall you don't see any traps across the floor okay everyone else staying out in the hallway okay you manage to scoot through dancing around folks people kind of let you get by anyone else so you're dragging the duergar over in the-- yes as you guys step in here move up towards the back corner where there's the shiny glint tiberius you stay inside or outside kima walks in grog goes to start making his way in as he does you go over towards the glimmer the glimmer on the table you look it's just formless and kind of this weird spark of light it then vanishes and the doors that you guys entered-- -- slam behind you with tiberius grog and keyleth all kept outside of the room the rest of you guys the flames go to darkness and the entire room goes pitch-black grog's gonna go for the door however at this point in time i'm going to ask for-- no no no i'm not i'm working out what's actually gonna happen here all right so suddenly there is a cacophonous bit of pain streaking through pike vex and clarota guys go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw not you just you two so what's the-- okay so in the darkness suddenly there is this searing pain like some sort of screaming sound is blasting you from the inside of your very mind you two are both currently stunned on every turn you get to try and break that but right now neither of you can-- you both just sit there grasping your heads just screaming in pain as your body is unable to function or listen to any thought process clarota also unfortunately falls victim to this and is also unable to make any actions all right however-- you as you are currently pulling out your flametongue dagger you feel a presence nearby and with a little bit of embers around the fire you see out of nothing a figure step into view that apparently was not visible but a moment before a tall lithe figure with long limbs fingers and a wrapping of facial tentacles coming towards your face before you get the chance to stab you get a surprise attack from this guy all right that comes to an 18 versus armor class so as you go back for your blade to pull it out he grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you and the tentacles wrap around your face and pull you into this horrible toothy maw you feel this tearing pain sensation as its teeth begin to dig into your face you take 17 points of psychic damage as the actual presence of the tentacles pulling on your face you feel it's kind of grabbing your brain and trying to hold it in place you are currently considered grappled now guys everyone roll initiative that was a surprise round yes (laughs) all right so 25 to 20 all right 25 to 20 no one-- almost forgot go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw 23 all right you feel the presence of its mind pressing into your brain and you manage to through the pain of its tentacles pulling you towards its mouth shrug off its current attempt to push into your mind that's a good thing okay so you're still grappled but you're not stunned both of them are now visible right there all right so 25 to 20 20 to 15 17 and 16 all right so actually grog is going first all right and percy 15 to ten ten to five that's okay ten to five all right no you guys have not rested all right so first the top actually-- kima is at the top of the initiative order kima angrily leaps on top of the table and goes running down with an angry yell and leaps down toward the one that's currently grabbing onto you with its grapple as she's running a little bit of light bursts as you can see this divine energy begin to burst and glow off the edge of the greatsword that she's holding she leaps down and with a giant arc through the air that lights up that portion of the room with a brief sweep the blade comes down towards-- oh that'll hit second attack also hits so that comes to-- okay using her divine smite ability on top of that she manages to deal 37 points of damage to it as she finishes both of her strikes simultaneously the mindflayer however does not release its grasp on you you are still considered grappled that ends her turn grog now is gonna angrily attempt to bash into this door is gonna make an-- actually no no athletics check he's going to go into a rage and hitting away at the door (growling) liam and all right that puts a total of 32 points of damage that's enough so grog just takes two big swings the first one comes through cracks the door in half splitting it down the center rears back a second time cleaves through the door entirely what little bit is left on the hinges he kicks out with his foot leaving now this side completely open to the interior he then moves in around clarota that's as far as he can get in this current turn that brings us to vax well no you can try and make an acrobatics or athletics roll against them to try and break free i'll let you use that as your move or acrobatics up to you whichever's higher acrobatics then 27 that'll do it you manage to just in that moment of it being struck with the two blade strikes from lady kima you manage to pull your head free from its grasp and just manage to right yourself now the throbbing pain in your head of what you just narrowly avoided still there okay 18 currently that does hit yes okay go for it correct 45 all right so as you-- right the poison dagger i think you've already used the daily poison ability on this okay so the 45 points of damage you pull back and you jam it into the side of its eye you can see as it rears back a spray of dark-colored liquid kind of warms the side of your face as you pull the blade back out it rears back and (growls) you can hear its voice piercing into your head going i will eat you one way or another that's your main attack you can get your second attack i'm sorry 19 yeah that hits eight okay as it rears back and you hear it saying that you pull back and you grab with your off hand the cluster of tentacles in the front of its face and pull it down as you do the inertia-- you jam the blade into the other eye as you do you hear this blast burst of angry scream inside your head before it goes dead cold silent and the mind flayer falls to the ground all right that brings us to clarota who's currently stunned and fails save clarota's still stunned tiberius look through the door you can see over here barely it's very dark in the far corner you can see just the shape of some humanoid there what are you doing tiberius from what you can see it's maybe roughly six seven feet grog's blocking most of it right now you're in this giant great hall with giant tables and stools everywhere you can't see the ceiling right now there's no light the room is near pitch-black like there's just very little light in there currently all right okay the room all of a sudden bursts into view you can now see the walls the ceiling-- it's a smooth stone room there is a large chandelier currently hanging from the top of the ceiling it's about 25 feet up to the ceiling in this current room you do yes you see now there is a mind flayer currently ducking behind one of the tables right now you can see a number of your friends in the party are currently clutching their heads silently screaming to themselves unmoving there's two how many sorcerer points do you have left you spent a lot over the past couple games that's true actually okay just keep track of that so how many do you have left okay got you cool good on you all right so what's the save you get past that for the spell right it does make its save i believe it's 21 rolled a 21 versus your dc of your spell which i believe is not higher than 21 so yeah so he still takes the damage but is not pinned okay 18 points of damage and manages to pull out of the way just in time as it slams into him he darts off and catches himself on the ground kind of slowly levitating above the ground as he comes to a stop the pillar then slams into the roof this section here actually splinters part of the table which is now kind of lifted off-kilter at an angle yup it-- how i'm playing it is the impact of the pillar suddenly slamming in from underneath is what does the initial damage and he manages to roll off before it slams into the ceiling he kinda-- so however that ends your turn the mind flayer now looking around and seeing the room lit up seeing the entire group now in this room looks around at everyone puts its hands together and concentrates-- and as it does you see its form (sucking noise) vanish a few seconds pass you guys manage to shrug your stun and clarota as well all right i will he's doing his flower-girl moment passes behind you guys all right so what is the current mode of action for you guys okay all right through here you look through here and see what appears to be some sort of a kitchen you can see shelf units you can see what looks like a few tables you can see some kitchen elements all right you walk all the way in there's a door towards the back-- the right you see what looks to be a doorway that's partially open that leads to a staircase looks like it's going up okay you look over here it's a double door that is currently closed you haven't taken a short rest yet you have to-- you guys have to stop and take ten minutes 15 minutes to rest to do that so-- make a perception check okay okay so percy and both you guys open this doorway it opens up into what looks to be another smaller eating hall this one's nicer this one has one long table this is probably where the more socially risen-- looks like it hasn't been used for a day or two no current goodies in this area no okay all right you guys press down here there apparently are now-- you can see there's another set of double doors-- all right so you guys are all moving back with-- -- vex to return to the previous storage room all right okay go ahead and make a perception check with advantage 27 you smell that on this floor there doesn't appear to be any duergar in your immediate vicinity there is a strong lingering scent of them coming from the doorway that you're currently at correct like it-- you can kind of tell there was a recent moving of a large number of duergar you don't know all righty okay you open the doors into what appears to be a large temple chamber a place of worship what you see are a series of long wooden benches that are arranged to look towards the center there is an altar to the right that is a risen kind of stone dais and in the center there is a stone table an altar which has a piece of black cloth wrapped over it and something on top of it you can't see from this distance in the center of the room there is a 12-foot-tall statue of what looks like an extremely strong armored duergar clutching a giant warhammer and a shield yup 27 there does not appear to be anybody inside this room however do you have a religion-- roll religion guys you are not over there unfortunately pike you make your way through eventually coming down this hallway-- (clanking) go ahead and make a religion check all right as you're heading that direction slowly best that you can tell right now this room is definitely a small temple built to-- and the name kind of escapes you the words trying to form in your head for a second and then eventually you come to realize this is a chapel to laduguer laduguer is the deity of the duergar it's the god that basically freed them from their original enslavement from the illithids and they worship as a pinnacle of power strength and conquest all right there is a door right over here okay all right so you go ahead and open the door it opens up into what you can immediately see is a chamber that is some kind of magical laboratory you see in the far corner hunched a robed duergar and as you open the door there's a slight sound a click sound and a jet of greenish fume begins to spray up into your face make a constitution save 15 all right so you take 11 points of poison damage however you can feel the poison forcing its way into your lungs you manage to back out of the cloud in time and cough it up and your general physical well-being-- you resist most of the effects of the poison however this poison fume trap did appear to go off and as the smoke slowly dissipates you hear a chuckle across the other side you don't hear the noise you're too far away you guys do hear it though okay as you rush over scanlan's backed up away and you can see there's this chamber here it's dissipated at this point it's thin enough you still can smell it and it smells awful like a very very heavy electrical fire-type smell yeah it's up to you what're you going to do all right go for it then you didn't say it this time okay both hit go ahead and roll damage on each 15 and eight all right all right so both arrows you've been firing over the top he's kind of hard to see with the table and from being crouched in the corner but both arrows still manage to barely make their mark one kind of pins him against the wall and he looks at his shoulder briefly looks back at you raises his hand as he begins muttering something under his breath as he does your arrow (shnk) through his hand and he tries to shake it and now he's pinned to the wall with an arrow in the middle of his hand laura and yeah you can still tell trinket to move what are you gonna do okay got you all right so what are you guys doing over in the temple all right you keep walking towards it you make your way you look at the top of the dais where the altar is and on top you can see the black cloth that is wrapped over it the scent gets to you before the actual visual it's freshly rotting flesh of some kind and as you glance over you can see there is a heart that has been cut from a body and it's at the point where the blood has coagulated and begin to become thick it's roughly dwarven size okay it tastes disgusting she got you a heart okay this way okay you make your way into what looks like a giant foyer into a secondary entrance in the side of the fortress make a stealth check 28 got it okay so as you make your way through you eventually careen to this corner you can see another hallway what appears to be another room of some kind you also glance back and see there are two sets of stairways that go up and down this is a giant foyer that leads outside of the fortress this way here this way this comes to an abrupt end at that point a rocky wall into the mountain itself that it's buttressed up against all right as you move through-- so you glance in this room there's an open walkway and what appears to be another barrack section also completely empty okay as you slide along here to make your way around to a door there okay 26 all right the door does not appear to be trapped okay okay what are you examining yeah okay so you look at the face of laduguer you can see it's very very old it's very well-crafted you can see a lot of very meticulous craftsmanship went into its creation it almost glistens with a perfection that is out of place in an area that is so covered in soot and various other volcanic activity-based mineral deposits okay there is some sort of a hum to the air that has an arcane element to it but you are unable to pinpoint what it necessarily means or what the source is okay so while you're opening the door the mage in the far corner kind of looks about sporadically and looks down at the arrow in its hand and its shoulder and just kind of fearfully wait wait wait wait stop don't attack let's have a conversation he leans forward kind of pulling the arrow out of the doorway (groans in pain) starts hobbling towards you a little bit okay as you both enter both of you make constitution saving throws as two more plumes of poison (pff) out of the ground as both you and trinket walk in 15 okay and for trinket as well okay you take seven points of poison damage trinket however takes 14 points of poison damage seven and trinket is currently considered poisoned it means disadvantage on attack rolls disadvantage on ability checks and now there's a bear coughing and kind of thrashing about the room the table it bumps into and it kind of topples over well this is just a reactionary moment of you guys coughing and trying to get out of this poisonous fume you can yes okay that completely removes the poison okay well done so that's your action you now as you are checking the door and you open it up you hear all this commotion going off to the side now scanlan you're over there as well watching as more plumes of these poisonous smoke bits you can move over and look you can just barely make out his form it is a dark room that is currently filled with a slowly dissipating green cloud so it's hard to make him out all right seven points from vicious mockery all right (laughter) that's crazy okay so it has to make a will saving throw against your dc it rolls a three it does not so as you shout out into this room the currently fearful duergar mage kind of glances eyes slide about hears these words and you see him wrack his head for a second with a sudden sense of self-loathing and disappointment (laughter) all right awesome yeah you can start moving back this way yes you do all right you glance inside at what looks to be some sort of a training room there are-- most of the floor itself is stone and in the far corner there is a large section that is mainly just sand and dirt and there are a number of wooden training structures you know various shields and wooden bars that are used as a means of training for weaponry there's what looks like a giant rack of weapons full of arms and stuff go ahead and make a perception check most of the materials in this room look like the basic duergar fare (laughs) okay as you run in go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw all right so you take ten points of lightning damage as you feel a tile on the ground trigger and then spring up and as it does you hear this sudden high-pitched whine as blue energy streaks up from the floor runs through your body thankfully you manage to dive out of the way and touch the ground to ground the energy minimizing the damage but yeah you triggered (laughs) triggered a trap plate you're beginning to get the sense that a lot of this tactic of this fortress now has been to lead you guys through a-- a maze of traps all right at this point kima is now-- as kima hears you shouting all these curses into the room kima pushes past you and pushes past you you can see kima coming into the room behind you guys steps over the broken table down in front of the circle and grabs the mage by the front of his robe pulling him into her face the mage at this point is still kind of reeling from the fact that you managed to strike him so deeply in the heart of his hearts however kima with a look of absolute death in her face grabs him and pulls him forward and says listen where is the rest of your fucking army she's going to make an intimidation check he does not succeed in resisting that the duergar is pressed against the wall now and she's slamming him against the back of a bookshelf look all right they're waiting for you up there all right you're not going to survive this at this point the entire city's probably waiting for you in the outside of the fortress and those that are upstairs are well-prepared okay your best chance of survival is laying down your arms and surrendering i'm looking out for your best interests here kima who is still holding him against there you can see her hand releases the scruff and he takes a deep breath for a second but before he can finish exhaling she goes in immediately grabbing his throat and squeezing it extremely tight as she does you see his tongue dangling out the side of his mouth (strangling noises) as she's cutting off his entire air supply she pulls forward and takes the greatsword and begins to slowly push it into his abdomen as she does he starts screaming in terrible pain you can see her just slowly pushing the blade through his body into the bookcase behind as she does she goes you're gonna tell me right now who they have waiting for us upstairs as she begins to push all the way to the hilt now he's pinned up against the bookcase and probably a portion of the stonework behind him he's now got blood pouring out the sides of his face and outside the front of his nose the duergar being held up against the wall says whatever you haven't killed the army's probably up with the king himself they're all waiting for you and i hope they piss on your body when they're done at which point she takes the blade and twists it as she does he gives this guttural yelp and his eyes just go blank blanker than the duergar eyes normally are go ahead and make an investigation check perception check looks like from glancing about the room and getting a feel for it there were three traps that were all placed directly at the front of the door basically to give him a point of defense they've all been triggered so you don't have to worry about any more in this room this is yes you're looking around as well (sings) remember your abilities okay sorry scanlan so as kima pulls the blade from its body kicking it off the greatsword and wiping it across the leather on the side-- the leather that you gave to her and a little part of you is like (sadly) hmm so you guys made your way back clarota's there against the corner and grog rushes over just feeling like he was ready for action what's going on that's up to you guys as i say do you guys want to take a short rest yes glancing around the room you manage to find two potions of healing one potion of superior healing you also find one vial of some sort of weird viscous yellow liquid that you cannot identify sure you can give it a go it looks delicious no actually you can't make out it has some changing color as you kind of swirl the bottle and watch the texture inside shift and change with the centrifugal force you can't make out anything about its intent but it does feel like it's a potion created with some effect 18 arcana okay you take a look at it it definitely is magical you don't have a lot of experience with alchemy but you gather that the effect that it would have upon imbibement would be to alter your physical form in some way you just don't know the specific effects so as you guys all kind of enter this room this brief safe zone to take a short rest if you feel you want to heal yourself up and regain any short rest-based abilities do so that's what i was going to say we can return-- so we're going to take a quick bathroom break we're going to play the videos again we'll return here in just a second as the next element of the attack on emberhold continues (whispers) galaxies all right see you guys in a second welcome back guys all right so we've had ourselves sufficiently rested which is awesome awesome all right thank you zac couple of quick things you wanted to announce the espionage-- yeah did you follow him because you have to follow him-- awesome also as a heads-up guys we've had some people perpetually asking us about the shirts that we made that shirt right there so we have a-- it's a temporary-- it's very basic but we have up if you guys ever want to go to critrolecom we have a limited run of those shirts currently available for purchase that is actually his nickname the cost includes shipping we'll get-- we're packaging them ourselves we'll have hopefully more in the future but this is the first attempt at trying to do something like this for you guys so-- yeah shipping shipping is included with the price guys don't worry but yeah so anyway check that out thank you guys so much and let's go ahead and get back to the game proper okay so so so the limited run was very limited-- i guess we'll have to order some more then we were gauging interest i guess there's interest sorry guys all right well we'll-- thank you guys very much we'll get more to you very soon yeah we'll figure it out anyway guys thank you so much let's get to the game thank you so much chat nice all right so for all who didn't get 'em we'll have more soon i promise so so so you've housed yourselves into this enchanting room this magical laboratory and taken about a 15-minute rest you're able to use any of your unused hit dice to heal yourself up if need be any-- how many hit dice do you have left yeah there's the difference all right so so an extra 1d6 healing to anyone so as you guys manage to pull yourself out of your rest mode you now glance out and the hallway's still quiet you can hear the movement of footsteps up above you what is your intent as she stands up and she holds the greatsword and swings it a bit what i'm seeking lies deeper into this cavern whatever is at the heart of this illithid scourge and she glances over at clarota-- who's in the back corner hands folded-- and there's a slight mental hiss sound in her direction there's something far darker at the heart of this temple i've seen it but i have my thoughts and my ideas but i need confirmation before i speak of any doom-saying however the link between those foul creatures and the assault that's currently mounting against kraghammer lie upstairs at the center of this duergar people the link between this k'varn character-- to be honest we've entirely lost the element of surprise i would not wish to sacrifice as foolishly for a few additional trinkets of my own when i feel that this should do well enough as long as we manage to work together and be smart about this how do you think k'varn is able to send these armies up again and again towards the back door of kraghammer besides if we go on and leave them as they are who's to say they wouldn't come up behind us and then we're fighting a two-sided front once we get there grog's standing there clutching his greataxe i say i haven't been able to kill much since we got here let's kill something oh yeah of course and he goes into his bag of holding and pulls out his now half-empty cask and you see him frown as he hears it clink around he pours everyone a small drink to what is now an empty cask up to a certain point you mean laduguer at the moment he would be speaking yeah uh you'll be rolling you hear in the back of your mind this subtle soft echoing chuckle you're all crazy i like it (laughter) all right takes her greatsword in her hands lead the way i would say like momentarily right beforehand it's one of those things where it has to be in the moment when the adrenaline's pumping i think for it to last into the combat so you are venturing up which stairway all right so you guys-- you'd become a soft target all right you guys all make your way up and you're all squeezing into this tiny tiny room you're all shoulder-to-shoulder essentially you come up to the top area there's a small box and there is just a single stone door okay you take a moment and you place your hand along this stone surface you find that there's a low hum to it and you can tell that there's a small almost like a thin whisper of string laid across the very top of the stone where the wall meets it 26 okay you come up and you find that this is a very very fine hair trigger this is actually a partial enchantment as part of a magical trap you know that with the slightest hint of false vibration to it the door shifting or hitting it in the wrong place will trigger whatever this trap is and so you bring your tools up you manage to place one at the base of each point at where this arcane silver thread lies across simultaneously you take your daggers and place them underneath the thread at each ends and sever them both at the same time the thin whisper of a string just slowly glides down and vanishes into a small sparkle of light hearing it you hear what sounds like a low mutter of somewhere in the neighbourhood of ten to 15 low voices and the slow small shuffling of many many many many footsteps it kind of couple of footsteps some talking soft footprints you can hear the scraping of metal-- there is a hallway this way the whispers and voices aren't directly on the other side of this wall they're just in that room echoing through but you do hear a lot of people there all right so what are you doing (laughs) roll for perceiving (laughter) (laughs) okay no traps you both glide your way up and peek around the corner what you see immediately are six duergar all stationed in this hallway guarding what looks like two large doors and entrance to this main chamber and they're all just standing there weapons ready looking around this big chamber here that you-- who is up once again clearing his throat in your presence okay make a stealth check that's when you see this long row of duergar that are all kind of armored and ready guarding the front of this chamber okay so this giant water sphere appears at which side of the wall okay as the water sphere begins to pull in saving throws what's your dc this is a dexterity save all right all of them fail (cheering) there is now an entire clustered sphere of water that is containing a mishmash of duergar call lightning all right so as keyleth you step forward out in the hallway you bring your arm up and there's this small cluster of dark clouds beginning to form and swirl up on the top of the 20-foot hallway as it swirls you bring your arm downward and there's a sudden crack of thunder a loud blasting sound that echoes through the hallway as the lightning strikes the center of the sphere the water itself bursts as the actual cacophonous blast of the lightning loosely shakes the aquatic sphere however go ahead and roll damage you get an additional two dice of damage to each one of the duergar because they are contained in the water correct you just roll once and that's across the board for all of them and they are at a disadvantage because they are in the sphere it's really funny because two of them rolled 20s in a row but they're at a disadvantage okay so the sphere explodes the actual stone on the ground you can feel shake and shudder with the impact of the lightning storm all but one of the duergar are blown apart and scattered across the wall akira-style just (splat) against the walls one of them is still in the center of the sphere now looking charred and burnt and eyes wide open with anger and frustration he rolled a 14 vs the dc which i think is-- all right how much total did you do how much did you do total hold on so as the duergar is currently held aloft in this aquatic sphere half-charred and burnt with pieces of his friends floating in the water around him he hears through this kind of warbling sound you ugly you ugly and he sees everyone kind of step in the hallway clapping with you and he kind of looks around at himself looks at his situation and eventually just gives up and takes a big old gulp of water and drowns inside the aquatic sphere (laughter) good news is you guys royally screwed over six duergar one of which you shamed him to death (laughter) you transform no marisha did you transform okay so tiberius you leap onto her back okay so you cast thaumaturgy on him to give him a vocal emphasis a roaring booming voice do you stay with him or do you move back with the rest of the group religion check you have no idea you know the deity exists you don't know of any sort of animal beast or creature symbolism that would befit a duergar god keyleth's form shifts as you see a bunch of arachnid-like legs sprawl out the side of her torso her form condenses into a dark chitinous shell as two giant claws form out the side of her body and a giant poison stinger curls up from behind tiberius kind of holds on during the transformation-- all right the rest of you are here so you feel this kind of divine energy cascade around your throat you can feel your vocal cords themselves are temporarily infused with some sort of divine presence you've transformed yourself now into the visage of this duergar deity standing at probably a good-- what height are you going at the duergar are about four-and-a-half feet tall all right six-foot-tall duergar standing there what are you doing grog says which way which way do i go i'm walking back for you he looks like he's listening mostly (laughter) you hear shifting in the doorway from the front where you guys are what's the plan what's doing what all right go ahead and make an athletics check no plus your strength a 22 all right the doors splinter open the doors are actually broken off the hinges as you guys come bursting in-- so the doors burst open and you guys come through all of the duergar stand there with their weapons at the ready you can see in the back on this raised platform where the cloth stops there is two thrones at the top two duergar sitting on the thrones at the ready you can see two kind of lizard-like creatures in the back on chained leashes however all of the duergar that are ready to strike as you burst through take a step back looking extremely confused about what's going on make a persuasion check okay the duergar in the front take another step back looking both frightened and awed the one nearest to you takes his hammer and throws it to the ground and takes a knee at which point two of the other ones nearby kind of look at each other and look back at the one who's on on the ground they put their hammers down and they kneel as well at which point in the back you see the two throned figures stand up one of which you can barely see in the dim light outside of your light spell that's currently gleaming above you this long almost-touching-the-floor black braided beard that drags right over this heavy-set plate of jagged black iron metal a giant sword in his hand you're kneeling below this false idol this imposter so the light (pff) all right so you do fireball where are you casting fireball or just doing it to do it plume of flame roll an intimidation check okay make a stealth check who else is going in there with him okay your stealth roll so you rolled a-- okay you can see this figure-- which you are gathering at this point is probably king murghol-- still holding his sword aloft looks back towards his wife who's sitting in the throne next to him who is just standing up kind of confused all of the duergar are now looking over their shoulders back towards the king and watching this transpire between the two of you 32 you're moving in everyone else staying in the hallway as you guys push in further and further the group that are kneeling move back in sheer fear and horror at which point the king takes a step down off of the throne area onto the next platform weapons still at his side and says men i've trained you i've raised you i've fed you and i've kept you alive so the blast hits him and a 20-foot radius that will grab everything in that radius including you so go ahead and roll damage 8d6 25 okay okay good so it explodes around them you see all of them kind of shield themselves from the blast of flame as it spreads out-- so while you're looking that up-- the duergar brace themselves and they have an innate natural resistance against things magical in nature so they all take the brunt of the damage however it does not do as much as you hoped to the group all of them look hurt but definitely not taken out of the fight the two lizard creatures you now have a better look at you do see it's familiar they have numerous sets of legs and though the chains hold them at bay both of them glance up instinctually i want you tiberius to make two constitution saving throws yeah you take half-damage so you take the-- what was the total damage on your fireball so you take 15 points of fire damage so as you glance about the room now you look over and both of these lizard creatures kind of look towards you you kind of look back and forth-- there's a slight gleam in their eye suddenly you feel your form begin to tighten up instant you are considered restrained which means you are at disadvantage to all your attack rolls and ability checks for right now no this is as it's happening your turn is still happening this is all kind of a fluid moment things happen as they happen until initiative is being rolled which is now so everyone roll initiative all right so 25 to 20 plus your-- plus nothing for dex okay okay so 25 to 20 21 all right all right all righty 20 to 15 all right 15 to ten all right all right that brings us to top of the round percy you're up i mean you can yell like one thing okay that brings us back to the top vax you're up okay it is a critical because it does not see you and has not acted yet this combat okay all right gotcha so the first one actually jams into one of its eyes it didn't even see you it recoils back slapping your hand back out of the way the other dagger strikes and just gleans off its shoulder however it turns around with its other eye and it definitely knows you're there no it pushed you off all right that brings us to grog he goes into a rage and grog is going to go ahead and take his axe with the chain on it and throw it toward the first duergar he sees which is right here throws it all right that is a-- that's going to miss he rolled a four swings past he's going to make an athletics check to see if he can bring it back that he succeeds so he throws the axe it swings past the duergar clangs to the ground uses his chain he yanks it back catches it in his hand his turn is spent however next up is scanlan no it has to be a line it has to go straight all right at the start of your turn-- no at the start of your turn you come up and the creature looks over and you guys make eye contact you weren't averting your gaze go ahead and make a constitution save plus your constitution modifier all right so as it glances over at you there's a shine in its eye and you feel all of a sudden your form for a second tense and you shrug off the effect untouched by it now go ahead and take your turn okay so you pull back and you unleash a lightning bolt it goes streaking across the room unfortunately he's just out of the line array but it does streak across and blast both of these now visibly basilisks in front of you you hit automatically just go ahead and roll damage (laughter) 29 one fails its saving throw one makes it so 29 damage to one and 14 to the other all right all righty that's it that ends scanlan's turn king murghol's turn now king murghol is going to-- it sees this blast of lightning streak past now as it blasts just barely passing in front of it hitting both of his pet basilisks now seeing that there's like a full army between himself and the current intruders one of which is visibly stiffening he glances over at this tiny gnome individual who now gave loose to this bolt of energy grabs his blade with both hands and goes running towards you with an angry-- but he uses a bonus action quickly to pull out a vial pop a cork chug it shatter the glass on the ground as he does you can see his arms actually billow and grow extremely strong and thick with muscle marisha and this was purplish in color he then runs forward and is going to take his turn swinging at scanlan a d8 off of his first attack five okay well he rolled a 20 which brings it down oh a total of 20 which brings it down to 15 what's your armor class oh second strike is a 13 third strike is a 12 wow he just can't hit at all this turn but however the one strike he does get on you the sword comes down streaks across the front of you and as you're finishing your last final note of that song you take 18 points of slashing damage that ends his turn this brings us back to vex you can you can get-- let's see that'll get everybody you can angle it in a way that will-- well if you wanna get the king in it you're going to hit these two here and grog okay so you will be able to hit everything in that row so go for it how does the effect on that work all right so go ahead and roll 3d8 17 okay and what's the effect on the spell like what do they roll against dexterity saving throw king makes his with a 20 so he takes half-damage for it or no damage okay so what was the total again it was-- what was the total originally it was-- what was the total 17 okay so that is eight damage to the king right so roll the additional one on that four gotcha all right the basilisk also does not make its save what's the dc on this your spell dc at the top of your spell page 14 no that's just to hit something with a spell all right so basilisk in front makes it so it takes the eight damage okay the rest of the duergar they do make their saves they take half damage however with the spray of arrows that comes flying out of the front of your bow you manage to take out five duergar in one swipe the others ones remain damaged but still standing also now dexterity saving throw for you tiberius and grog nice so both you guys take eight damage grog fails grog takes 17 it's all right all right vex is that the end of your turn okay all right that ends your turn it is now lady kima's turn kima rushes in angrily she has to make a saving throw succeeds against the basilisk as it glances past rushes forward in combat with both king murghol and the basilisk however as she goes in for king murghol screaming the blade of the greatsword arcing across the air with a divine glowing energy you see it aiming for the king but then looks to her side and sees this dangerous lizard creature recognizing it in a moment she changes her trajectory and swings next to the lizard with her first strike that is a-- that hits and that strike does just enough damage she cleaves that basilisk in two with her first strike with her first strike using the inertia she turns around and strikes at king murghol however king murghol seeing her come forward takes his sword up and manages to parry hers to the side both of them lock for a second as he steps into her and kind of glares into her face oh you're supposed to be downstairs for playtime pushes her off with his blade that brings us to queen ulara's turn queen ulara is now standing over there with trinket towards her back as she instinctually does this she goes ahead and reaches up places her hand on the front of her robes you can see this duergar woman with kind of long reddish hair that she's let flow to the back to the small of her back she stands up out of the throne as she puts her hand on her chest her form shimmers much like you saw earlier on tiberius in your earlier battle she moves back to there that's a reaction okay so let's go ahead and do the contested roll okay so the dc is 12 go ahead and you roll that blur is second-level yes so counterspell go ahead and-- oh-- interrupt a creature in process of casting a spell if the creature is casting a spell-- third level or lower it fails and has no effect so yeah it just counters it entirely so the-- her form begins to shimmer for a second all of a sudden tiberius your attempt to go ahead and counter the spell that burst of energy you're trying to put through the blur vanishes she looks back at you yeah so with her sorcery points expended on that quick cast she turns around for her main action puts out her fingers and you see these blasts of blue energy begin to rocket out from her fingertips across the room in what is a chain lightning so this'll be towards-- actually this'd be towards you vex kima and scanlan yeah vex and vax both of you over there yeah chain lightning man it's a bitch all right all right so vax go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw seven all right well you've already used one for the area effect the other one reduces the damage by half okay so you're reducing the damage by half okay so instead you take 18 points of lightning damage however both vex and scanlan and kima all have to make dexterity saving throws as well she makes hers 16 okay so you took was it 18 lightning damage i said just you mean your dexterity modifier 22 okay then you would've taken half damage make it quarter damage so you take half of that even so keep that in mind when you make your dexterity saving throw so that would give you total how much damage so it was 18 you took right so 36 damage to scanlan and to kima and to you vex 36 points of lightning damage that ends her turn tiberius you're up so you it's your turn now as you're now on top of the scorpion still what do you got tiberius quick before you miss your turn all right all right so (laughs) i'd say probably a 20-foot radius around would put it about there so as you polish off the ring and release it the bead of red energy streaks across blasting the floor the secondary explosion giant fireball just bursts into the room go ahead and roll damage on that 23 okay the rest of these duergar detonate blasted away out of play just their bodies go thrown against the walls and the various pillars in the room there's two pillars over there they're kind of holding the ceiling up the rest of them just go thrown about the room the queen takes a bit of the damage but seems to shrug off most of it right there okay right there all right all right so you get to throw at a target though right or are you just throwing on the ground to do the radial okay so you take-- you form the ice knife you throw it it streaks across slams into the stone floor and explodes sending shards of ice out go ahead and roll damage correct saving throw which it succeeds okay both succeed for half damage so seven points of damage to each all right got it cool that ends your turn tiberius clarota now-- clarota steps forward-- seeing the other mind flayer there steps past and decides to go into a contest of wills against it all right this is intense all right clarota is going to step forward and begin to intensely stare at-- you can see the air itself seems to shimmer and push like a strange bubble shifting between the two of them at this connection point mind flayer now one-eyed and seeping liquid from the side of its face glares back at him fails his saving throw this mind flayer suddenly diverts its attention away from clarota and towards the queen (cheering) that ends clarota's turn all right the duergar would go if they weren't all blasted to hell that brings us to keyleth there you go yes you are you are going to have a disadvantage on the tail attack because you have tiberius on your back and you're trying to make sure you don't hit him with your tail so first two claw strikes no that does not hit does not hit clink clink off the armor tail strike yeah unfortunately just his thick suit of armor-- you're just hitting at him with the giant scorpion claws but nothing seems to be getting through you hear this clacking scorpion angrily (scorpion sounds) pike you're up for everyone who's in the radius everyone but grog essentially gets healed for 20 points grog's too far away from you unfortunately all right percy you're up okay so go ahead and fire with a disadvantage against the basilisk on the far end of the room 16 at disadvantage that does hit go ahead and roll damage also tiberius make another constitution saving throw six points of damage to the basilisk got it okay cool as you duck around the corner you've gotten these strikes in and as you're trying to-- as you finish your blows on the duergar king murghol in front of you you hear this clanking sound as tiberius's now fully stone form falls off of the scorpion onto the ground beside you the basilisk now takes its turn steps forward onto the edge it's going to go ahead and-- it's gonna be for lady kima it's going to attempt to make its stare at her lady kima-- lady kima who's currently in this blood frenzy against the king unfortunately is not paying attention off to the side the basilisk gets a glance out which she looks at from the corner of her eye she sees the movement over and has a hard time pushing through the stiffness as the gaze begins to take a clenching effect on her body yes thank you let's do that oh waze why's my phone on all right so that brings us to the-- oof okay this mind flayer who's currently dominated steps forward and is going to attempt to make a tentacle grab against the queen queen ulara manages to dodge out of the way seeing this coming and just backhands it while taking a step back unfortunately does not cling with the tentacle that ends its action yeah unfortunately that didn't hit all right next at the top that brings us to vax well at the start of your turn it's within 30 feet of you and you can see it are you going to-- okay so you're taking disadvantage on this attack so you move behind you're hidden your first attack that will not hit unfortunately that does hit yes okay as you rush over you take your first strike at the basilisk you see it reel back and slap around its tail you barely just get out of the way and as you see its head turning around to attempt to glare at you you instinctively take your offhand dagger and place it directly into the eye socket of the basilisk it sinks past your fingers and you feel that warm rush of blood and gore against your hand as you pull back it just slumps to the ground (cheering) lady kima is mid-effect and tiberius is solid stone i would say yeah you could spend the rest of your movement doing that yeah okay all right that ends your turn that brings us to grog grog turns and is going to go ahead and go raging frenzied against the queen and a critical hit (cheering) the first hit she's gonna go ahead and use her reaction to do shield it's going to up her defense first attack misses so two attacks miss now and the last attack is a critical hit which is nice so that's a-- all right so that's 31 points of damage oof that's a hefty chunk all right that ends grog's turn that brings us to scanlan yep you're right next to him okay okay (laughs) what's your dc all right this is through the hand cone okay that will be a 20 unfortunately makes his saving throw he glances back towards you with a look of confusion for a second looks at his feet and like begins to reach forward and then steels his mind and looks up at you angrily all right next up is king murghol who's furious now both of his beasts have been slain and most of his men have been completely torn asunder by multitudes of arrows and fireball spells he now growing in physical form on top of already the musculature he acquired from that potion is going to make his three attacks against whatever is nearby that's actually going to be-- actually that's gonna be two strikes against you scanlan since you just now tried to make him stand on his head and one against kima (laughter) -- a 24-- -- and against kima is a 20 that also hits so all three hit oof all right so the first strike hits you for 21 points of slashing damage the next one hits you for 23 points of slashing damage scanlan falls unconscious on the ground from the two strikes of the king the third strike back towards kima who's currently seizing from the effect of the spell she's restrained so he has advantage there's a process to undoing a creature into stone to your knowledge it does not seem to be having an effect however lady kima takes 22 points of damage all righty that brings us to-- vex you're up okay at who additional damage to the arrow so it explodes around right all right so fire the arrow so as your bonus action you go and you grab one of the arrows out from the back and as you pull it back you can see a bunch of these little thorns begin to grow and sprout from the actual shaft of the arrow you release it and as it arcs across-- against the queen all right go ahead and roll the damage for the arrow and the damage for the spell and all that doubles the bonus at the end doesn't double just the dice 36 points of damage yeah plus the seven and then it does-- it explodes in a radius and it does the dice damage the 2d10 to-- all right so the mind flayer and grog all righty grog does not make it and the mind flayer does not make it all right cool all right second arrow you can fire now if you want to all right that hits all right you see flames begin to burn up along the side of her robe and she's looking really flustered and frustrated at this point all right that brings us to kima's turn no she's made of hardy stuff kima currently is fighting this is going to go ahead and release an entire-- all of her attacks against the king murghol as he's right in front of her she has disadvantage on that unfortunately because she is restrained she's gonna make two attacks against him using divine smite expending a 3rd-level spell so that's 3d8 extra damage to each strike so the first one hits both hit all right she's going to do it twice that's gonna be 6d8 additional damage oof okay so as kima rears back her first strike comes down and hits overhead into king murghol's armor and as it does it hits the blade only goes about a few inches in but then all of a sudden the blade heats up white-hot and actually buries itself an additional six inches into his shoulder he screams out in pain reaches up and grabs the blade and as he does his hand actually burns in the process she pulls the blade out around and swings it down again sinking another eight inches into the side of his torso this time with a giant arc of white divine light into the side he looks like he's starting to bleed out from the two of the wounds really heavily the king is looking a little rough that ends kima's turn kima's going to try and make a saving throw kima pulls the blade out and turns to stone herself the king is looking a little rough the queen's turn the queen looks over at grog in front of her kinda frustratedly uses a bulk of sorcery points puts her hand up towards him as he's pulling his axe back angrily he fails his save and he puts his axe back down and looks towards the rest of the group eye color glazed over so that was her sorcery points her quick action she then says we're not gonna die this day alone and i won't die my love i'm sorry but there's much more work to be done and she raises her hand up and you see this buildup of green arcane energy at her hand she turns it towards the rest of the group faces it up towards the ceiling and releases this pulse of arcane green ill-looking energy that blasts into the stone ceiling as it does the stone itself disintegrates in a large chunk and a glowing mass of seeping hot molten magma begins to pour into the room it's now coming from right here so now magma is pouring onto the throne room from above the giant fall that is on top of the fortress is now peering into the room that brings us to tiberius who is stone clarota currently looks around and-- no you are a slate you are a blue screen you are grog after the intellect devourer okay (laughs) clarota steps back and grabs lady kima and begins dragging her back through the doorway pulling her down towards the stairway that brings us to keyleth it's a free action there is a body of a dead basilisk on the ground yes okay for the purposes of this i want you to go ahead and make a basic religion check wait no not religion for you it'd be nature just for the purposes of my thought i think a nature check would be an interesting way to see how this plays out 18 okay so as you bring this gust of cold wind swirling around the column of magma begins to cool and darken as trinket is like backing up against the wall and the magma is starting to singe the edge of trinket's nails it cools to a dark black kind of rockish color and the magma fall ceases but you can see parts of it breaking and beginning to break past that shell exterior so you've slowed it holding it there okay that brings us to pike from your knowledge no it's an arcane effect not a curse from your previous experience it's not the blood directly the blood itself has to be distilled into a specific alchemical form to reverse the effect no it wasn't drinking after the battle you guys took the blood prepared it and then used it as part of the recovery okay so you heal scanlan how much does he heal so you're healed 19 you're on the ground prone but you're conscious now you look up at pike and smile and you look over and see this large column of magma that's now cracking through stone and pouring into the throne room again no this has been a heal this has been-- no okay you can move that's about it i will say you can drag him you'll be at half speed you can try make a strength check let's say athletics do athletics okay so you grab onto tiberius you rush over after healing him grab and start dragging him towards the entrance at half-speed you manage to get him three squares that's as far as you got as you're pulling back the king as a reaction gets one strike on you with his sword that's gonna be a 19 your ac is 20 so the blade hits you-- the blade comes down towards you but with a flash of divine energy in your shoulder armor it just gets deflected off the side and you glare at him out of the side of your face and continue to drag tiberius out of the room all right percy you're up where over here oh you're gonna have to go around here then this is a really harrowing place okay all right so as you pull over you go ahead and aim up with your ice shot ready go ahead and fire 20 definitively hits it's not hard to do go ahead and roll damage and that will signify how long and how much it will stop so just the ice damage not the actual bullet it won't do anything so just-- just the ice damage two okay so as you blast up you can see as the magma's beginning to pour down again you blast it and it immediately-- a spot cools into a rock and begins to slip again you've maybe given yourself a couple more seconds that may be what you need you don't know but that's all you got on that one okay go for it okay 16 versus armor class will not hit unfortunately yeah okay so you're using your action surge okay so action surge you now have two more attacks go for it that hits (laughter) nine points of damage got it all right that hits go ahead and roll damage with the extra grit point you do two dice right nice okay so the next-- the first shot fires just ricochets off his armor and streaks across the room you get his attention though and he looks back at you with this kind of wild look in his eyes the muscles tensing you can see the armor actually bending and twisting against his physical form underneath however the next shot blasts off side of his jaw there's actually a giant gap now in his flesh as he looks back at you and you can see his teeth and as he grits down towards you now definitely intent on getting vengeance on that the second shot (impact sound) takes off a chunk of his head you can see the skull exposed on where you've now taken a piece of flesh off the top of his scalp he's looking pretty rough okay you can get back to there all right that brings us to-- he's not dead yet not dead yet all right the mind flayer who is no longer dominated as clarota took his attention off of that for the time being looks around at everyone sees the circumstance the magma flowing down and just grabs his chest and you can see his form blink out and vanish that brings us to the top vax at this round by the way is broken and has begun to spread the magma has now filled this much of the room and it's quickening all right go ahead and roll for the attack 20 does hit grog is not an ally currently you do not get sneak attack all right ten nice so the first blade plunges into her clavicle she maneuvers out of the way to the point where it misses any vital points but still sinks in she looks at you angrily and you can see her dull white ashy duergar eyes flash with an intense arcane rage as you pull the blade out her eyes dart around with some sort of a plan a thought process going through her head as the other blade sinks into the side of her torso she spits out blood that actually spatters across your face she pushes the blade out and you see her preparing herself for something that ends your turn grog currently moves forward towards you that is a 25 versus armor class how many times can you-- you've already used that it's once per encounter once per encounter you can use that next one is a 21 versus armor class once a round you can do it okay well never mind so take half on that first attack all right so first strike comes at you with a-- oof that'll be 19 points of damage reduced to nine second strike hits you for a total of 15 points of damage so 24 total and that's grog's go that brings us to scanlan it's a possibility you know the spell that's been cast on him-- you use it there is a chance but it has to be a contested roll yes it does unfortunately so it's your call no but i would say it's going to be difficult it's going to give-- all right you get back up what are you doing he's looking pretty rough what do you got go ahead quick magma's pouring through okay so go ahead and roll for an attack d20 so roll the dice you rolled an eight times two that's 16 plus whatever the bonus damage is for the sword it does so you strike with a critical hit doing-- let's see that's eight 16 plus seven 23 points of damage go ahead and roll for a second attack you can so what's your total you rolled a five plus-- add your proficiency modifier which is four plus your strength modifier so that's five to that which is ten makes it 20 which hits roll damage on the attack (cheering) six points of damage all right six on that plus your strength which is one seven plus the dawn blade which is-- that's eight so that's eight damage on top of the 23 how do you want to do this (cheering) so as you say that you-- the blade vibrates to the sound of your voice like the echoing of a song of scanlan behind yours in almost a chorus out of nowhere the blade streaks through the air coming down slitting across the back of his achilles' tendon he instinctually falls to one knee which is kind of the height level for you as you do you bring the blade around with a flourish and take murghol's head off his shoulders it spins tumbles to the ground and rolls across the floor into the magma blackened beard curling back as the rest of his face is melted away by the lava which is now pouring pretty heavily into this room all right so that's your action and your movement and your bonus action no you did your bonus action to do the extra attack all right so that's the end of your turn wow you used a sword and got a kill on a boss all right king murghol's turn would be now but he's on the ground vex you-- it's completely blocked right now through here yeah it is it's still pouring she slowed it down but it's still breaking through and pouring out slower it would be even bigger if they hadn't slowed it go for it roll for an attack first attack hits 14 points of damage hits roll damage on that 12 to hit or 12 damage all right 12 damage yep all right so both arrows (impact sounds) one clips her in the leg and the other embeds itself in her abdomen you see she grabs for it she's looking really rough next is kima kima's stone it's now the queen's turn she looks over at you who's stabbed her the arrows in her abdomen and she looks up at grog and says (sighs) we've got business elsewhere and she reaches out and touches grog both of them blink out dimension door a very familiar purplish color as you've seen you cast it they dimension door out of the entire vicinity at which point the stone rocks crack on the column and the magma now goes into full pour you guys have to get out of that tunnel what do you do now what's the process so this is going into a skill challenge now okay this will be the first skill challenge go ahead and make a dexterity check no the magic carpet is in the bag of holding that thing is huge you carry that with you you would be at disadvantage for everything you've been doing 18 okay so i mean you go over to it and you manage to gather up into your wine skin a little bit of basilisk's blood best you can the magma pulls close to you and you manage to just take six points of fire damage from just the general heat of the magma now pouring into the room it's spilling out and now just continuing to fill the rest of this chamber both of you guys make an athletics check for this this is just an athletics to pull them all off okay you guys grab and pull tiberius out of the room it takes the two of you to heft him over you manage to pull him out of the way that works out well down the stairway all right we don't need the video for this we're just going to do this visually so you guys manage to bring tiberius down the stairway what are you doing scanlan all right so that's enhance ability so you go ahead and give yourself enhance ability your strength is now-- you have advantage on all of your strength checks no clarota pulled kima out of the room so you guys are fine okay you do but the magma's so intense and this has filled so much of the room now that you get a localized area the rest of it just kinda flows around and continues to fill the space all right so all of you guys make a dexterity check to try to get down quickly go for it yes everyone makes one because of-- yes you do not for this one okay tiberius is okay gotcha so pike and scanlan both of you guys are unfortunately 'cause you're smaller and your legs are moving you guys rush down the stairway and curl around as the rest of you make your way to the door which is currently closed you are all kinda gathered at the exterior of that hidden doorway it's currently dark and held shut on where you guys entered however you two the magma's now reached the stairway it's beginning to pour down off the top and it manages to catch the two of you you guys each take five points of heat damage from the magma's proximity no pike and scanlan you guys make it to the bottom floor the doorway is currently closed for the secret exit of the fortress you guys just make it to the foot of the stairs you guys are now-- yeah it's the one you guys the one you guys-- it opens up outward okay as you're feeling around for the mechanism keyleth steps forward and basically the stone turns into almost a clay and she just pulls it apart a giant glob of magma pours down and splashes down onto the ground hitting everyone in the vicinity everyone down here takes 12 points of heat damage okay you guys push through the open hole that keyleth pushed in sweat dripping down your faces as the heat proximity to you is nigh-intolerable you make your way out of the gate and now you have that giant magma flow no no-- as you guys go and step out the doorway that opened up previously is what parted the magma flow you pulled it open so now it's just a wall of magma in front of you you did it's not there anymore it was permanent but a perpetual flow of magma on it for a period of a few hours will eventually eat through a stone wall okay it's probably the last of that you create a stone wall that juts out once again blocking off the magma flow you guys all step out of the room just as the main force of magma begins to fill the room behind you everyone make one more dexterity check to get out in time as it's a small space and you're pushing out you made nothing okay everyone under 15 you you percy i believe and keyleth the magma now as you're helping getting your friends out you're pushing out you push vex out-- vex darts out scanlan manages to get out as you guys are pulling tiberius through the hefty force of magma comes funneling down into the room and splashes across the floor that is 18 points of heat damage as you're pushing through vax you fall unconscious as the magma is currently lapping at the back of your leg the rest of you begin pushing out as you begin to realize that your half-elf friend is currently melting in a pool of magma go ahead and make a strength check this is strength at this point this is pure adrenaline pushing through 12 you manage to start pulling him up through the hole that keyleth made before you get to that point as you're readying for it 'cause it's a small space-- as you're pulling it giant bear claws come over and latch onto the back of vax's armor the grizzly bear begins to tense pulling back makes a strength check that'll do it both of you manage to pull you out you take an additional bit of heat damage you are now at two failed saving throws two failed death saving throws as he pulls it out you can see most of his foot is melted and his right leg okay you pull it out at this point the magma's beginning to fill up the room by the way you're outside of it how long does stone shape last what you used on the wall closing the wall okay how many spells do you have at that level three so you spent-- one going out coming-- no wait it's the same-- you haven't had a chance to do a full night's rest that's true so you used the stone form used stone wall that's true that's true you do that's good all right i just wanted to make sure okay so as you do that you send up another stone wall it blocks off the magma just as it begins to pour over and spill out into this vicinity it'll last a short time but it'll last enough for what you guys need you guys drag-- you can attempt to yeah go for it all right heals you comes to consciousness you guys are about ten feet away from the base of the stronghold your foot heals up but it's still burned for the time being until you can take some serious physical rest your movement is reduced by five and your stealth rolls are currently at disadvantage over time with some rest it can be but right now-- like you're healed up but that foot is scarred it probably spent a good six seconds completely submerged in molten lava quite possibly you all are just on the outskirts of the stronghold you can see now elements of the windows of the top floor are beginning to glow with internal light as the entire stronghold is currently filling up entirely with molten rock you're all resting for a moment off to the side grog is missing and you all take a moment to realize that somehow you all managed to survive this mostly however you didn't find the vault didn't find kima's stuff and a number of escaped individuals from this are out and at large we'll end today's game on
