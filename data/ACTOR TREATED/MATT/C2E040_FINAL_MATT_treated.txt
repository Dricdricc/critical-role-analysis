as such that brings us in to tonight's episode of critical role [tv static click] [groovy critical role theme] (laughter) you made your way to the bottom subterranean guardian chamber where you met a yuan-ti abomination that was laying guard to the true guardian a large hydra the hydra had turned around and laid waste to much of your party but you managed to through a series of clever choices uses of fire magic and some rapid assaults managed to cleave all the heads from its body and kill it just in time its corpse now lying fresh on the ground captain avantika seeming pleased and impressed by the display of the strange new compatriots that have now come to work under her you now sit in the stillness of this chamber able to now finally take a moment to look about and see what secrets or mysteries it holds so mighty nein what would you like to do avantika is sitting down for a second and getting her breath the rest of you who are still up in the hallway which is jester caduceus and jamedi and caleb all begin to slowly descend the stairs no it's currently slung over the side of the staircase that curves down into the subterranean chamber two healing potions and an epipen hold on jamedi's currently standing at the top glancing around the side he glances around and steps down another step i was not paid to do anything of this sort i was a guide i was to delve i am not skilled in the ways you are i'm not stupid to throw myself in front of a beast so large actually make a perception check looking at his person he has a short bow and a dagger and that is it he's not armed for any sort of main assault in fact most of his equipment and materials in the way he's armored and dressed is for expediency lack of sound and meant to blend into his surroundings fairly easy a lot of browns grays and dull greens he's definitely more of a scout and a tracker based on his skill set from what you've seen than any sort of frontline fighter as you approach she gets up and rummages off the side and pulls off a small lantern she keeps notched on the side of her belt make a perception check nothing in particular beyond what she previously had that you can tell at the moment no it's a small lantern maybe that big and she pulls a piece of cloth out that was meant to keep it from clattering or making any noise on the inside she pulls out the cloth tucks it in her pocket ignites the end of an oil wick the lantern glows a bit and gives off some light she begins walking along the walls of the inside of the chamber as you cast detect magic a few things all of your friends give off a faint aura everything but jamedi gives off a magical aura you also sense the columns themselves have a fairly powerful deep magical aura to them that's the most you can see at the moment nothing fjord as you begin to walk along what would be considered the southern walls around this side of the chamber you and avantika looking across the walls appear to be made of the same eldest stone that this temple is made from the newer materials that have been plastered and set against what once was this original temple did not make its way this far into the basement it seems that there is no intent to cover or at least hasn't gotten to the point of covering what originally lined the walls of this chamber and as such the original carvings remain what you see are three massive carved murals on that wall that wall and this far side mirroring the placement of the three pillars these murals stand probably 15 feet tall and about 20 or so feet wide you can see them depicting these giant faintly detailed and gently colored scenes though a lot of the coloration seems to have faded with dust and time some of the stone has been stained or painted to show some variation in color you can make out the simple shapes to fill out this much larger tapestry on the stone before you the one on that far wall as you come across it you see a crowd of people simple design but definitive heads and shoulders and legs you can see the humanoid form and there are many many clustered around the base of this mural above them you can see three larger humanoid figures that are haloed by a light or an aura that elevates them beyond this crowd three figures then over the top of that taking up probably 60 percent or more of this mural you see a humongous bird of dark purple flame that is wreathing the sky above this crowd you see its wings curved upward and then bent down and where the wings end fire curls and burns and the feathers on the edges of these wings definitively come up into a purple and dark gray flame with bits and specks of deep red at the top where its head looks down the beak long and pointed there are three eyes across its face and in each of these eyes you see set a rather large onyx stone a large flaming bird like a phoenix but dark purples and grays and deep reds in color each one of those eyes is an onyx stone probably about that big you don't see any magical essence on the carving or the stones just from those pillars glancing at the pillars too there's faint carved designs and shapes like swirling almost serpentine circles and curves that chain into each other and swirl off imagine a column made of chains if you will but the patterns are erratic in places and don't seem to follow from what you can tell no that's the far wall if you continue curving around to the one closest to me you meet up with avantika at that point she holds her lantern up and you can see a very similar layout a very familiar showing of a crowd much like the previous one though some of their shapes have different shoulders it looks almost like their clothing or whatever their accoutrements are are different it seems to insinuate a different people above them three more figures stand shown larger and emanating some sort of radiance or aura above that you see this giant coiled serpent of scale fin and eyes made of amber each of these eyes is a separate amber piece about that big around the size of a large gold piece all along the coil of its body at the very top where it's rearing up this very long thin pointed almost lizard-like maw opens up and behind it this giant tidal wave is curling and frozen in place looking like it's about to bear down on and either destroy or sweep away the crowd below it very much so on this one the head of it has three eyes as well but the body itself has eyes evenly spaced around the entire length of its coiled body every single eye on it is a piece of amber matching size they all appear to be present more detail has been put into them more care has been placed into their carving avantika continues curving around with a big wide-eyed smile on her face as she passes by it she goes this is incredible i can only assume this is carved by the ki'nau that is correct she continues curving around beau and caduceus as you walk to the other wall that side of the chamber there you see a curling thick worm of some kind its folded skin and tooth-like scales burrowing up to produce mountains over the crowd cliff faces made of stone and rock breaking and about to plummet into the crowd below there beneath it you see three figures once more elevated the same wreath around them of some sort of radiance or light the people below don't seem scared there's no sign of fleeing or fear just a gathering within this large terrifying worm-like creature its form bulbous with these strange protrusions these spine-like scales that you can imagine would pull it through the broken earth you see this ring of teeth that accentuates where its mouth is and on the inside where a tongue would be there instead are three eyes across the inside of its mouth these appear to be made of some kind of ivory some polished white material the three figures all appear to be humanoid they're not detailed enough to the point where you can see features to differentiate between elven human halfling it's just silhouettes of three figures you hear avantika's voice echo from across the way she goes these are the chosen she brings light over towards the one of uk'otoa on the wall and goes i guess that makes this one me she takes her finger and takes a little blood from the corner of her mouth from the fight and draws a little smiley face on one of the three and this one is you and goes and draws another face on the middle one that is a very good question only one yes they were a very informative partner they are the one that introduced me to the great possibility of power under uk'otoa we traveled this ocean for quite a number of years together but they proved to be a coward they took something important to our mission and vanished and i have spent many years trying to recover what they stole with no luck i figured it was more worth my time to pillage enough coin to pay other people to find them for me and so far based on the fact that it brought you to me a much more successful endeavor eh this is very true well it seems i may have some information let's get back to the ship eh let's finish our business here and let's talk over a glass of wine this is true she begins to make her way towards the well at the center of the chamber glancing about at the pillars you two can see within the shapes glowing runes that trace from ceiling to floor then across the ground and all meet at the well it's not technically a language these are runes these are glyphs of some kind make an arcana check there are different epochs in historical time in which there have been advances and developments of arcane runes and sigils there is the early basis of magical runes which is a deviation of draconic as a language and then there are ways that they've been altered and made more efficient these are very old base early draconic runes as such they hold a lot more very primal magical power and usually are reserved for larger rituals and magics that are meant to last for very long periods of time the nature of the magic on these runes from what you can tell it's a little hard to get the direct essence but there is some sort of an abjuration-based magic you head on over to the other yuan-ti and as you approach the body lies there tongue lolling out and drool and blood a mixture of thick saliva mingling with the dark black-purple blood out of the corner of its mouth its eyes wide open and rolled back its dark thick green scales of its snake-like head and thick muscular scaled torso all lie limp across the stone where it was slain its blade has clattered to the ground a few feet from its grasp and its polished marble and silver shield scattered a few feet from its form the rest of its tail coils and is limp off to the side from there make an investigation check nice you find on its body 26 pieces of gold only gold no other pieces of coin on its body the blade is a very very large blade it looks like it's well made both for ceremonial purposes and for actual combat it is both beautiful and very well made and the shield itself is also exquisitely crafted and shows no signs of wear okay at this point avantika's walked to the edge of the well and looks down into the space below do you really she whips around as you do that and both her hand grabs your wrist to deflect it and you wrench your wrist free as a natural instinct and you both have this moment of-- matt and he's still at the top of the stairs he goes well for one thing i was paid to go to the temple and no further the fact that i have even come this far is because i need to claim my pay avantika goes actually i think ladies first may the best one win she dives in okay you jump in first off caleb's distraction has given her quite a lead she's a fairly accomplished swimmer and is making her way down this well continues on for a good 70 80 or so feet below the water is cold it is salt water right you are swimming after her make an athletics check you have advantage because the water is-- because of your armor it's not giving you as much resistance heading south you begin to close the gap slowly but she's eagerly swimming down with almost a fervor as you get deeper into this column this basin below the walls begin to grow thick with algae and grime like a thick-- it could be a plant matter that's just accrued over the walls or it could be waste matter from the hydra in its home that has slowly congealed to cover the walls the stone begins to give way to this dark slick material once you hit about the 70 80 foot point the tunnel begins to open like a giant bulb or internal spherical chamber role another athletics check she's still keeping her distance from you heading deeper in the saltiness of the water the brininess the flavor in your mouth gets more intense what was once a semblance of sea water is definitively sea water but also very strongly briny sea water make another athletics check correct for you because you have dark vision you can see within 30 feet of you essentially as far as you look the chamber is-- no not at all it's pitch black down here that being the case you don't see the bottom of the chamber you just see it open-- and just her but she's gaining just delving straight down into the darkness make another athletics check 20 okay she did not role that well that time she's beginning to tire it seems or at least you're starting to pick up speed as you continue to follow you get probably 40 or so feet from her but she's still ahead of you role again natural 20 nice she rolled okay you see now the bottom begin to approach in the peripheral of your dark vision the floor greets to meet you and you pick up enough speed to where you both impact the bottom of this chamber at the same time you both hit she looks up at you and your eyes meet a few bubbles escape from her mouth and you see her big wide toothy grin and she begins scraping grime off the floor all right make an investigation check 23 as the two of you are currently scraping bits of grime and algae off the ground there are bits of plants that are growing up like lightless kelp that seems to have made some sort of a living down here in this subterranean water-filled chamber as you're pushing through and scraping around your hand scoops this large bit of grime from in front of you and you can see a stone relief at the very base of the bottom a concave spherical shape about the size of a fist she notices it looks at it looks at you what are you doing you can you go and jam your hand and its hitting your armor you have a full-on leather plate right there it's about that big and you can see it is concave it's about the size of the stone that you'd found you can the falchion appears in your hand and as you do this bright yellow light is now emanating from the center of its hilt where the eye itself is glowing with its own lantern-like source at which point avantika is now rushing towards that thing make an initiative roll because you gave her enough time to get up right next to you and now we're going to see who gets to it first her hand-- she has now pulled the glove from her right hand as you go to thrust the hilt of the falchion down towards it you see her hand reach out and just manage to cover the little space first as it does you can see her body tense for a second and where her hand is this bright familiar yellow glow seems to now spread from between her fingers sending beams off in multiple directions her face looks aghast in shock for a second and a large bubble escapes from her mouth she looks over to you with this dazed look and pulls her hand back there in the palm there's this large open wound where blood's beginning to cloud the dark water below there in the center of this hole you can see one of the cloven stones there at which point a bunch of these runes begin to glow in three different directions from around the base up the sides up the chamber the rest of you looking around suddenly see this dull blue glow begin to get brighter from within this well you watch as these runes that you guys didn't notice except for the two of you before begin to suddenly glow up the sides the three pillars suddenly begin to spiral and glow as all these runes come to life avantika pulls back and looks back at her hand she looks back at you her eyes blink for a second and she just smiles and you hear this earth-shuddering soulful crack sound rocks the entirety of the temple bubbles suddenly this one burst of air that had been trapped in the ground below is all immediately released as one and rises the water above you can look around and see the interior of this there is a heavy black crack in the stone of this chamber as you guys all hear this earth-shattering bam dust falls off the ceiling of this chamber from the inside the pillars themselves still stand but there are multiple places in this chamber now where these large black cracks now seem to have snaked their way in one instant burst across parts of the wall the glowing runes blink out make an investigation check you start pulling through the weeds and the kelp and the grime and-- nothing it's all smooth stone except for this one little alcove that you found first avantika is now swimming frantically up towards the surface just trying to kick she lost quite a bit of air you go grab her okay make a grapple check-- make an athletics check no she kicks right out of your grasp she looks back with an expression of surprise make a deception check she looks confused and continues swimming upward not reading too much into it she continues to clamber up to the surface the rest of you as you're looking about the surface of the water begins to spill over the sides of the well he goes yeah okay of course jester's like this is not very good where's fjord she's looking over very nervously towards the pool which now the chamber's rapidly filling you're already at knee height okay you guys glancing down jamedi's back in the chamber his eyes wide goes we should go bring her back she owes me money as you guys all begin to climb up the stairs the chamber is filling very quickly with the water it's now reaching the base of the stairs at which point as you guys-- beau you and jester there's just enough water now where your buoyancy carries you off your feet and you're now actually treading water in the chamber at which point avantika makes it to the surface with a large gasp of air and but a few moments later fjord also breaks the surface it's continuing to fill the stairway that's leading upward the water has now reached the base of the doorway and you have a few moments maybe six seconds or so before the doorway itself is completely filled with water you're all going into a full swim here double move half speed for all of you guys so it's going to take you a little bit except for you you guys are already up there as you all get to the stairway and make your way up to the top the water continues to pour up following behind you you get to the stairs and you're having to trudge through you get up to the next the secondary floor and there you stand with the walls that are partially relieved and covered and there is the stone slab that is lifted up and there's orchard before you what do you do yeah there is the fountain but it has been-- it rose back up to the top when this chamber door was opened currently no it's raised up and closed off the front when you opened the doorway to get deeper into the basement make a perception check with you disadvantage because you are human yes you can see the pillar that holds the fountain at the top and there are the stairs still part of it and you can see where it's up there but whatever mechanism rocks-- mm-hmm the central chamber is now-- the water has now reached the base of orchard and is now filling you don't know the button you never found it i don't know who did okay you go to the-- there are as you can see now the water that has begun to fill up the chamber is taking-- it's a little slower in here because it's a much wider space now but you can see eggs starting to flow float out from the other chambers the other two rooms were the two hatchery areas where you saw the larger eggs were set make an intelligence check no it's just straight bonus you recall it was in the chamber where you're standing and it's not too far from the stairs where you guys descended below you look over to the side make a quick investigation check you reach over and you find it and you hit it the door slams shut and locks you in the room you hear a grinding on the other side of the chamber of the fountain lowering nott and everybody else who hasn't left that chamber is inside the only people that said they were leaving that room i believe were caduceus who was going up so all of you are now locked in the chamber with nott you're all in the chamber with nott yeah the fountain raises up the chamber opens up again okay you move around you cast mage hand the door slams shut the two other doors slam shut the chamber now is about waist high in water and you watch as the pillar begins to slowly lower it is a slow drag down okay the stairway itself if you recall ends a little bit ways up and there's a bit of a drop down to get to it it slowly comes down and does meet the floor there's a bit of a lip to get up there now so if you ascend to the top of the staircase there is about a ten foot or so jump where it is smooth walls before you can actually get to the top floor yasha goes over and gives you a boost that gives you advantage on your acrobatics check to try and parkour up the stairs and leap off the sides you leap slide off the side and manage to fall down into the water next to it you come out of the surface the chamber is now halfway full and it's almost starting to reach to the top mighty caduceus yes you're tall enough to the point where i'd say because it's double the size right so you're 14 feet you're not tall enough for the whole chamber but you're tall enough to push people through alley oop-ing one after the other you grab each person and lift them up like a little booster into the chamber one by one you guys all get up into the top now and caduceus you're too big to get up-- you pull caduceus up you guys are now in the chamber standing there there's the stairs that lead up at which point you hear footfalls and you see coming around the corner down-- it seems that the sound of the resounding crack in this temple has drawn the attention of three yuan-ti they turn the corner you see one of them two snake arms a familiar sight as one of the malisons comes down and two broodguard are there what are you doing the water is now spilling up past out of the hole and now the top room is now starting to fill with water you are go for it at this point the water seems to have accelerated and has now filled the chamber as you fire-- all right okay you're now underwater you take your last breath and you've all completely been submerged in this chamber the other yuan-ti you can see in the darkness below here the only bit of light that you have are the globes still from you although are those concentration yes so you're casting light on your stick okay (laughter) okay the malison succeeds the two broodguard fail roll damage on that that is correct 12 point of radiant damage nice all right what was the roll you had to hit 16 that will hit the malison you do not get sneak attack however nice that finishes your go there i'd allow it because we'll say you're like-- you were standing on the water so as you're leaning over the surface you're like squeezing it out nice 11 points of damage good so i now need everyone to roll initiative well now you don't anymore the water surface begins to crush underneath you and then you have to delve underneath as it meets it it's filled up and it's now making its way up the stairs towards the top of the temple so 25 to 20 anyone all right and roll for yasha 20 to 15 15 to ten guys (laugher) nott and then cad-- caleb and jester then fjord at the bottom awesome that was my dante that's okay it just means you guys are now in the process of slowly drowning it is-- well since they're not officially in this-- now that we are in combat-- there is the nature-- caduceus just made his way up there there's beau and there's jamedi top of the initiative order beau you're up first while you're in water movement is considered difficult terrain if i recall attacks are made at disadvantage while in water those are the stairs that lead upward yes yeah that's an option that is entirely an option you can do there were holes above but they were in the ceiling and they were part of the stonework up top there was an actual trapdoor that you had locked behind you no that you know of there are holes above which is where the sacrificial blood would drip through into the fountain so what are you doing guys are you running first you're swimming (counting) beau is also-- no she's not out of the temple she's heading up the stairs she's out of the battle for the moment so that finishes beau's turn it is now their turn they both rolled really high initiative and you guys rolled really terribly the malisons closest are going to-- he is well he's still within 15 feet of you so at the top of his turn he takes the save all right natural 20 on its save so it takes half damage it still takes damage so nine this burst of radiant energy inside-- (growling) there's bubbles that escape from its mouth it's going to come forward and take two swipes at you fjord with both of its serpent hands all right that is a 16 to hit and a natural 20 but it has disadvantage because it's in water that is still a 19 to hit you do manage to take-- from one serpent you just manage to glide out of the way in the middle of the water the second one that is four plus three seven piercing damage including ten points of poison damage yeah unfortunately no because it's straight from the fangs in your bloodstream it surges pain in your chest you also lose a bit of air instinctively from the pain so consider now your air supply is halved essentially the dc is going higher when we start getting to that depending on how long we're down here that ends his go now it's the two broodguards broodguards they're both already within the radius so they both have to make wisdom saves at the top of the turn it's a different turn so roll again no it's the top of their turn it happens sorry spirit guardians happens at the top of the turn it doesn't happen immediately yeah at the top of their turn so the damage they would've taken this turn they've already taken so we'll let that happen marking that down good to remember they both move forward one broodguard is going to attack you nott it's going to do two claw attacks and a bite attack disadvantage on each though the first one is a 15 one claw attack just goes wide the other one 16 one claw you manage to duck under one the other one slams into the side of your body pushing you through the water and down into the stonework causing your hip to hit the side that's going to do four points of slashing damage this giant serpentine mouth out of its weird lizard-like body is going to strike out and bite you oh two tens that's 14 to hit you manage to push up and jam your hand up into its jaw and keep it from biting you and push it away the other one's going up towards yasha yasha was not raging so the first one with disadvantage is 15 to hit 15 hits it's going to be a claw attack ooh eight points of slashing damage next attack with a claw with disadvantage natural one that is a complete miss yasha takes one claw and (grunting) barely affects it the other one she grabs its hand in the middle of the grasp and pushes it back she grabs her sword ready now as she is going to get her blade ready it's going to bite towards the front of her jaw and chest that is 17 she takes six points of piercing damage that ends the broodguards' turn yasha's up next yasha's also lost quite a bit of air on that turn those two hits that hit her mark down two hits of oxygen loss on her keeping tabs on this this will come into play in a bit depending on what happens she's right there she's in melee with the broodguard yes she's in a rage she has the reckless okay so that just makes it a straight attack because she has disadvantage underwater definitely hits yeah hits that's just 2d6 that one's looking really bad after the blasts that it took from the spirit guardians and the two strikes from yasha you can see now there's a cloud of dark crimson in the water around it it's thrashing about in pain you can see it looking a bit woozy in the dark water that finishes yasha you going to move at all she can move around it as long as she stays in melee she can still move around i got you that's what i figured that finishes yasha's turn nott's up next you had shot this one you can drop it for the moment fire it and pick it back up i'll let that happen because there is water and it's already soaking it's like-- (splashing crossbow firing) i'll say narratively it makes sense melee spell attack with disadvantage yes 15 hits ac is 14 eight points of damage to it as you reach out and grab it-- (electric shock) you watch as its tongue retracts into its head and its eyes go wide (pained noise) it loses some air and it eventually shakes and pushes off your hand you can do it but you lose a bunch of air to do it yes you do this is as far as you can get swimming over-- that is your go nott it is now caduceus caleb and jester you guys can decide amongst yourselves the order (counting) that gets you about there you're right about there on the steps swimming through the air okay that finishes caleb's go what's jester doing she's engaged with this broodguard right there that's a saving throw for him what's the save that is a 13 that does not do it 2d12 i think he's already taken damage casting the spell's a bonus action right so yeah you'd be up there there you go thank you for the heads up on that ten points oof yeah he's not looking good either they're both looking pretty rough she is currently-- both of you since you cast spells mark five points of lost air for the purposes of this challenge to keep it interesting five points before you're now starting to make-- is now considered how long you can hold your breath going forward each hit's a minute off the-- i'll have to look at how i worked it out here essentially at this point now jester and nott are going to have to start making constitution saving throws each round that finishes jester's go she moves around over there behind the side caduceus what're you doing blight staff swing disadvantage on the attack okay so you're going to swim up on top of the fountain is that all you're doing okay ends caduceus' go fjord you're up no it's two eldritch blasts or two strikes go for it roll for attack with disadvantage 16 hits roll damage on him nine points of damage all righty still up hurt but still up go for it 16 hits again roll damage 11 points of damage that'll do it you hear the dull impact of the eldritch blast and the second (impact) under the water in that flash of light that second sickly green glow flash in the water one of the broodguards begins to float up limply towards the ceiling no longer alive that will get you right about there on the stairs there you go that'll do you'll swim right there that's perfect it does get to swipe at you with disadvantage that's going to be nine plus five that's 14 it does it scrapes across your shield as you swim away quickly just barely making it that finishes your turn fjord beau you're up you're going up the staircase but you're part way up yeah still filling and it's still above you like you can maybe catch up to the top if you want to if you use your full movement you'll get up to the top where the door is downstairs you mean you tie take the crowbar and throw it behind so it's like (bouncing) and rolls partway down the stairs okay with that you'll make it all the way to the top you get to the small inner chamber which is now halfway to stomach-filled making it to the top you look up and you can see there is-- it's a little bit crouch-down there is the latch and there is the lock mechanism beneath it yeah you locked it behind you when you guys entered the temple somebody found the key it was on one of the guys from the first encounter of this chamber well it's their turn now the malison going to make its saving throw that's going to be a 14 what's the dc 16 so roll full damage on that 3d8 16 points of damage ooh he's looking really bad when it comes to their turn one of them's dead now the other two their turn's next we'll get to that when he finishes his turn but one of them is dead so there's only one other guy the malison in a burst of angry pixies swarming around his body is looking really hurt as he moves around the trail of blood stays in the water behind the head as it shifts around both of the serpent arms look up towards caduceus the source of these angry spirits and is going to make two strikes against him because you're the one right there that is 13 to hit second strike that's a 12 it's like 18 six 16 eight bad rolls both serpent strikes from its arms reach out towards you and caduceus you're tiny enough right now although are you still holding the tiny spell on caduceus is expeditious retreat concentration okay so you're regular form and you bear down with the shield and deflect both bits of green and pinkish lichen torn off and float away in the water away from the strikes that finishes its go the other broodguard has to make another save that is a seven plus-- no that does not make it so full damage on the other broodguard no actually 15 points of damage that'll do it this guy also sparks and dies in the water that's caduceus' spell that finishes their go yasha's up okay got you (counting) then moving the rest way up that will get her halfway up the steps put her there okay finishing yasha's turn nott you're up shades of the kraken battle returning jamedi has essentially just swam around this whole thing-- we'll say for the purposes of this avantika has at this point swept up and taken her turn that she should have taken before and is going to take three strikes against the malison that's my own fault but we'll see with disadvantage that's cocked that still hits because its armor class is only 12 ten points of damage second strike with the rapier disadvantage that does not hit the dagger strike-- no misses again swinging out piercing through the water with the rapier and the dagger and just to scrape across the side of its body but most of the strikes go wide and she's swimming around this way no she's still staying in combat she moved around him but is staying engaged but is currently looking to make another opening and then dive off back towards the stairs nott sorry your turn now at the end of your turn you swim up a bit there go for it disadvantage on the attack 15 hits and engaged with allies you do get sneak attack damage yeah it's engaged with caduceus and avantika how do you want to do this as you do you pierce past all the humanoid muscles across the neck and its shoulders immediately the water before you fills with crimson you can see it thrash for a minute its serpent arms trying to reach behind to strike at you you swim away as they go limp and it begins to float up so that's that you still have a little movement left that is about as far as you can get with dash you can get up there so you're with fjord make a constitution saving throw please you are not drowning yet but you're on the cusp that ends your go nott caduceus caleb and jester you're up she's up with fjord and i need you to make a constitution saving throw for jester caduceus i need you to make one too because you did cast a spell spirit guardians while underwater she rolled nine total jester's drowning you see her swimming she's (choking) and begins kicking in the water before starting to-- you rolled an eight caduceus as well they both swim towards the staircase and you see them both beginning to clutch at their throats you used your full movement to get there next turn you're going to be unconscious ending your go caleb what are you doing you can get up to the front there it gets you to the last bit of air as it's about to hit the surface at the end of this combat round basically after fjord the chamber that beau is in is now full the water has filled the entirety of the temple yes you do reach the door okay make a lock picking attempt no disadvantage because you're underwater no that's a failure you're sticking trying to get through it no effect fjord you're up she is no longer drowning but you have to make a con save at the end of your turn that's your action to do that you breathe some of your air into her you still have movement you make it halfway up actually no because you have full move don't you you get almost to the top not fully but almost to the top constitution saving throw please you sir are considered drowning yes you do you're fine that brings around to the top there beau the water fills the gap okay so you're going to pull jester up she's conscious so you're going to get her closer sure you go down takes you i'll say two movements to get down there and you pull her part way up are you using your ki point for step of the wind last ki point will do that that will get her halfway up the stairs because i'm saying pulling her the dragging motion is half movement so that will get you down to her yeah you'll get her part way up the stairs about halfway up toward where the top chamber is it did okay no i would say that there was enough air thank you so you're fine ends beau's turn that brings us to yasha avantika has also swam up and jamedi is now gathering as well jamedi and avantika both grab caduceus' body who is drowning and begin pulling him up the stairs behind them yasha gets up there to the top yasha's now in there waiting there in the chamber there's the gate below getting ready looking around trying to get people to move upward that finishes her go nott you use half your movement to catch up to jester where beau is and then you grab her with the little bit of movement you move her an additional five feet before your movement is done you can attempt to bonus action dash you get another 15 feet you get her near the top of the staircase on the top floor that ends your turn nott now it is jester's caleb's and caduceus' turn caduceus you are unconscious i need you to make a death save at the top of your turn i need to keep reminding myself that death saves are at the top of the turn not in the-- success on the save that finishes caduceus' turn caleb and jester between all of you guys jester and you all manage to make your way up the top and jester's turn-- jester fumbles through her sack pulls up the key and gets it so-- this is how the ending of the first poseidon movie should have happened (laughter) because all of this water pressure just built up at the top of this temple suddenly released as the latch and this geyser of water thrusts all of you rapidly out the top you all get shot about a good 15 20 feet up you have a look down at the temple which you can now see these large cracks that have set in the sides where bits of water are pouring out through small cracks now this large geyser thrusts in the air and you all began to plummet and fall okay perfect as you all begin to drift down the geyser slows the pressure releases but now water is just pouring out of the sides of the temple and it's completely flooding the city you watch as yuan-ti that are rushing up the side of the temple are washed down into the basin that is now the center of the city streets you can see now that the city is being thrust up the side some have moved to the top of buildings and are glancing up and seeing you guys as you begin to descend now you're about to hit the top of this and there is now a perpetual flow of water coming out of the top of this temple what are you going to do on the sides of it you guys are just slowly drifting down towards what's essentially a raging-- rapid water slide on all ends correct okay yeah no because we haven't gone to his turn yet you've begun drowning and you guys got thrust out so you managed just catch your breath because it didn't come back to your turn yet that very next turn before jester got it opened you've would have been down so you just caught your breath-- the very last minute basically as the darkness began to take your vision you are thrust out and your eyes go wide again as you see this sunlight above you as your air rushes back into your lungs and then suddenly begin to drift slowly down looking below-- you can see the city and the entire landscape of this strange village below you so what are you guys doing they are on all sides like the entire city surrounds the temple you guys only came up on one side the water is pouring down on all sides any spells that's concentration is lost okay so as you all begin to slowly drift and try paddling your way through the air i'm going to say for the purpose of this we'll make this a group skill check everyone make a dexterity check to try and comb your way through the air enough using your body to try and guide your plummeting two successes failure you're fine success three successes one failure jester-- success on jester for yasha success all right so only one fail as a group that is a group success so you all manage to just-- yep and both jamedi and avantika are fine so you all manage to just barely push your way in a certain direction you all begin to drift down-- yeah slowly making your way through until eventually the surface of the water the rushing sound gets louder and louder as you all strike it as you do it carries you down in this rapid goonies-style waterslide you're all coasting down the side of the stones and elements of the stone just barely scraping and clipping the back of your butt and your back and you're like oh god it's not enough to damage you but you're going to be bruised as shit in the morning but you're coasting down you can see as the city is coming towards you the water is now pouring through and snaking through the city-- no pun intended-- there are groups of yuan-ti that have clamored up onto the buildings and are currently trying to pull themselves out of the water and help others get up out of the middle of this strange flood that has taken over the center of their civilization it's still pouring out of the temple it seems orly's vengeance you guys coast down you hit the bottom and you can see now where the water hits and it snakes through it curves back to the right and the left which path are you going to try to guide towards you have an unconscious sledding furbolg you do it's like (brrrrrrrrr) it's almost like curling yes you would so you're guiding and shouting directions caleb's guiding you guys you guys move around the side riding the water at this point the flood of water begins to subside a bit it's still guiding you through but you can see now the initial burst and rushing of the rapids is not a continuous thing there is some sort of a tapering to it you guys just managed to have been there for the initial burst at this point you guys coast around one side come round and you're now going down to the center of the street where you previously hid and basically like muscled two of them into a doorway after stabbing and killing them rapidly you're now gliding through the street along with the flow of the water trying to keep above the surface caduceus being pushed along by little nott going (thudding) at this point from one of the nearby building tops you see two of these centurion yuan-ti see you guys pass beneath begin giving out a call and then shouting over in their direction pointing towards you your presence is now aware to at least a handful of nearby yuan-ti their weapons were either lost in the stream or not wielded of course but they're beginning to pull out their things you guys continue to ride this forward you're leading the path the way you can go i need everybody to make a general acrobatics check to try and guide their body through the water in the direction that caleb is shouting this is a group check those count as double successes still good you guys got this shit like i don't even-- yeah you're just out i think-- what did she roll i'll say with that higher roll she's been able to make her way over towards the side of you guys coasting along-- all righty so jester just manages to just make it over to the edge of you as the water which was about maybe with the flash flood about three and a half four feet deep is now descending to about two foot so some of you your feet manage to catch the floor beneath but the water is still rushing rather fast you can continue to just go with the flow of it or try and gather your footing but it's up to you you can cast cure wounds on caduceus a d4 plus-- so go to roll d4 plus your wisdom modifier sorry d8 for cure wounds you're at five hit points you come into consciousness on a sled over water yes when you're drowning it brings you to zero hit points riding the water eventually you guys manage to keep it going are you going with the water or are you fighting it mostly yeah so you just continue with the flow of it the flow eventually comes to a stop on the outside of the city maybe about 15 or 20 feet from the treeline where you first entered okay as a note all the makeup has been washed off sorry as you guys are rushing towards the treeline you hear the shouting in the distance you glance over now that the water level has stopped you can look behind and you can see probably two dozen or so yuan-ti have now begun to give chase they're about a hundred feet behind you but they saw you exit and they're on their way giving chase now we're turning this into a skill challenge chase as you guys are making your way through as you guys are now charging into the jungle you're not doing stealth so your speed isn't as slow which took you a day and a half or so to traverse this jungle to the center unless you want to keep stealthy if it's charging through-- full speed great we have six rounds of this challenge correct success and failure do different things who wants to offer something to help in this skill challenge much like the resurrection challenge in this game think of a creative way that you can help your progression it depends on what you want to do you're still under 10 minutes yes okay i will say for that make a survival check with advantage that's one-- that's two successes on that one we'll add to that so keeping a close eye caleb is darting ahead into the jungle shouting out various issues jamedi is trying to keep up with you but behind is also helping you keep an eye and shouting out traps that he had helped you bypass before and making sure you guys don't fall off the path that you had made your way through that he had set on his map beforehand that had avoided the bigger dangers in the jungle between the two of you you manage to get a fair bit in there and the sound of the chasing yuan-ti does not seem to be getting louder which is good that's one who does the next offer okay yasha going to push at the front which with a higher speed than you she can definitely do and begin to carve through swarths of the jungle to make it an easier passage for her make an athletics check please straight up unless she's raging okay i'll allow that for this that's a success yasha's now ahead of the group she's carving through you can see there are bits when you come up to the front where there is just dense clusters of tangled vines where the path you are taking-- caleb stops you at the front because you deviated a little from the path where you were because you were running too fast at this point you're not used to this level of acceleration for an extended period of time right at the end of your expeditious retreat right as the spell is about to fade you come to that group of vines at that point you're about to spin and warn everybody and all you see is this blur of yasha carve through them they all fall to the ground the path before you is open she goes go all of you just keep running in that direction yasha's continuing that who's taking the next bit yeah rumble of thunder you can do it has limitations to the sound you can make but you can make a rumble of thunder oh such as-- i misunderstood what you're saying yeah there are certain sounds you can make the sound of a whole group-- okay so rustling in the bushes it makes sense make a deception check 15 that's just barely a success all right so with that you hear the chanting sounds the war cry of yuan-ti behind you and it begins to divert slightly getting them off track just a little bit all right who's taking the next bit who hasn't offered one there's six stages of this from what you can tell not at the moment but if you wanted to use your turn to do something to see if somebody is what do you want to do your crit earlier gave a lower dc for the next check so that helped out tremendously okay as a note you're in a lush jungle-- probably not going to do much on this that's a hard smooth floor type scenario i mean you can if you want to no not at the moment you have a second level spell to use the glove yeah you do that's right okay okay this is a combined maneuver here i'd say for the success of this this is going to be a combination of your-- make a roll with your ranged spell attack-- yeah you can go ahead and make a general strength roll nice roll okay you manage to lob it behind with a fair amount of strength so it goes about ten 15 feet behind you okay it does a little whirl it (whoof) through the air and bounds a bit into the jungle behind you are you detonating it just 15 20 feet behind you or are you waiting for something else to come out correct but they're not visible yet though you don't know where you are okay what did you roll you do what was the second one sorry 20 and 12 were the two highest got you okay so the two hit so roll damage the damage is going to be important here because it is a waterlogged container of black powder and may not be enough to truly ignite or cause an explosion here or burn through the barrel we'll see it's intact yeah but it's wet it's soaked through a little bit this isn't a beer barrel that'll be enough all right so as it darts behind you watch the vision of caleb spinning behind and releasing the glove in front with these three arcs of flame one of them hits a nearby bush and sets it aflame the other two one of them hits the barrel and sends it arcing once more and the second one hits it detonates and you guys feel this blast of hot wind behind you as your hair gets blown before your face the entire jungle around you lights for a moment with bright yellow-white light and there in that space now is a couple of trees that have now set aflame and a section of darkened crater on the ground where the barrel was the loud blast echoes across the jungle of the island around you i'll consider that a success you guys keep rushing you assume wherever the yuan-ti were they're a little unsettled by this large explosion in the direction of where they're travelling and it slows them down a bit as they try and coast around the area where the damage is however there seems to be a lizardmen hunting party now that is in the jungle a little ways ahead of you you guys have been running for the better part of two hours now it's a ways through this jungle to get back to the shore so first and foremost i need everyone here to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw please good okay you take a point of exhaustion there caleb just barely succeeded one point of exhaustion all right you're fine avantika takes a point of exhaustion all right you guys continue onward since you're just running through this jungle best you can full sprint it manages to keep ahead but there is a threat of exhaustion as you continue to move so you now begin to hear the sound this familiar clacking (guttural noises) sound of the lizardmen that you saw in the jungle before who's doing what you're still doing it you had four total successes in the round you had one critical success which improved-- you don't see them there but you hear them in the direction you are apparently the noise and the explosion caught the attention of a nearby lizardmen hunting party so you're doing the exact same thing with a different item it's going to have a higher dc but you can do it it's your call i'm just saying it's something you can do you want to do it no no it's a great suggestion i'm just letting you know progressively doing the same thing over and over again it's going to continue to raise the dc it's a cantrip cantrips don't have all that power there there you go anybody else okay two lizardfolk in the group now all right doesn't have to be abilities it can be just whatever you think you would do in the area to help you heard the hunting call of them yes somewhere in the front and to the right of where you were as you guys were running through the jungle okay are you guys stopping for nott then okay yes you do with advantage because of your cloak okay so you are successfully stealthed this is not technically a success because this isn't actually helping the endeavor but you do manage to move ahead and at your speed you come upon the hunting party you can see now there are about six lizardmen with nets shields and spears that are currently making their way in the direction of near where your party is currently waiting for you the more time that passes the closer the yuan-ti get to your party four of them have shields and spears and two of them have spears with nets and the other ones have nets apparently tucked behind their back they're out here to catch and drag things back okay make an arcana check yes this is to see if you can influence the magical nature of your cantrip strong enough to try and trip up one of them okay that's barely a success because that's not a very effective plan necessarily one of them gets tripped up in the net and the other ones look back at it and start clacking at it and they're complaining about the one guy that fell behind like an asshole and is slowing down their trajectory not a lot of distraction you can return you figure you bought a little bit of time for your party but not much okay okay you all continue following caleb they are now seemingly turning on you (snarling) all right you're darting through the jungle-- kind of in the adjacent direction okay no worries they're giving chase they're following behind you they know this jungle very well and can traverse it very easily however you're quick and you're small for that we'll say two of them throw ranged spears at you that's a 15 to hit and a 12 nope both spears (impact) to the nearby trees and you keep running trying to make it through eventually you hear the sound of-- yeah (gulping) as you're going you hear the footfalls breaking through of nearby brush and glance over afraid to see yuan-ti and you can see the shapes of your group maybe 25 or 30 or so feet to your left not at the moment you guys are just running i mean the lizardmen you knew were off to the front and right and you guys darted at an angle and you're guiding them still in the direction toward the-- no yeah you haven't seen any of the yuan-ti you've gotten enough gain on them but they've gotten a bit closer but they haven't appeared yet no you're just-- correct you guys continue to run continue to run continue to run-- everyone make another constitution saving throw please yasha takes a point of exhaustion fjord barely succeeds dc goes up by two every time we do this 20 success secondary point of exhaustion your speed is now halved caleb is now winded and now starting to drag the group back a bit ten point of exhaustion caduceus anyone who has one point of exhaustion your ability checks are at disadvantage right now two points your speed is halved i will make this one of your checks make an athletics check you have disadvantage because-- okay so you share the idea with yasha yasha's going to attempt to-- does yasha have a point of exhaustion so disadvantage on her athletics check one second please because this is going to attribute to her-- 19 that's a success that puts us at six total successes-- --across the checks here yasha throws caleb fireman-carry over the shoulder and you guys begin running and running and running for this next additional hour now as you guys are charging through following the path we'll say you've gone three or four hours of straight sprint through the forest sprint stop run you're breathing heavy you're sweating profusely your body is aching your mouth is just filled with the worst cottonmouth you're dehydrated you can hear the yelping of approaching lizardmen and yuan-ti as you see the light begin to slowly break ahead of you through the trees as the treeline begins to thin and the faintest bit of blue is visible within a few more moments you break through the treeline and you've found yourself back to the white sand beaches of urukaxl there as you come out to the sand the hot reflection of the sun against the light you can see now the sun is close to setting at this point the sky itself has gotten slowly darker as you've moved past the white beaches have now come to a faint dull yellow and orange with the coming sunset light nott emerges from the nearby brush she's catching up with the rest of you guys you guys look and there are the two rowboats that are still right where you left them okay-- i will say roll an arcana check for me unfortunately as a cantrip the perpetual fiery quality of it it can do bursts of damage and plops of flame but unfortunately the treeline here is too humid the air here is too wet and none of the trees are catching however you manage to get over yasha throws you onto one of the two rowboats you guys get on too at this point you can now see breaching one side of the treeline the yuan-ti the other side a group of lizardmen they come to a head and look at each other and look at you half of each group charges at each other-- --while the other half begins to charge towards the rowboats they're about 40 feet away it's a 40 foot rush (cannon fire) bursts of sand columns of sand go flying into the air and you watch as one lizardman (scream) a yuan-ti bursts off to the side you look over you can see the flashes of light on the sides of the squalleater-- --as volley after volley of cannon fire is blown towards the edge of the shoreline a couple close calls as it's not a perfect aiming implement you see as-- you dodge out of the way as (splashing) big burst of water some of the yuan-ti dive into the water and are now swimming through trying to come back-- you can see their serpentine bodies making their way in your direction hitting in the water as you do eventually you guys get far enough away from the edge it becomes less advantageous for them to focus on you and than to focus each other through the cacophony of explosions and the rest are wrestling the much larger force of both the lizardpeople that live on this island and the yuan-ti that have given chase are now focused on each other and this conflict is now spilling back into the jungle and away from the beach as you all very sore make your way towards the squalleater and now you can see offshore the mist or the mistake has also been pulled off the shore seemingly repaired enough to be at least semi-serviceable though it's only been a day or so and the repairs probably aren't long-haul permanent but for the first time in a very very long time this day you all take a deep breath some of you taking a short nap as you row yourself to the sunset over the distant far shores of the ocean towards the ships that mean safety-- and that's where we're going to take a break (groaning) okay then damn i don't either anyway friends we're going to go to our break here in just a moment we'll return but in the meantime we have another wyrmwood giveaway this fantastic delightful padauk dice vault which is magnetized opens up

we have a winner of the fantastic padauk dice vault i believe that's how it's pronounced or not i might be messing it up but regardless the winner is fmiller8 fmiller8 congratulations-- we'll get this vault sent out to you asap (cheering) nope because you're rowing to the ship and there's still the occasional (cannon fire) of the final shots sent off to deflect any interest in following or pursuing you towards the boats as you guys are trying to make some distance here you look over at avantika who has her one ungloved hand you can see the gap where the open wound there's just a little bit of blood trickling down her forearm where the eye once was she looks at it closes her fist closes her eyes and you feel the rowboat suddenly pick up speed and you watch as the water and the waves now give an additional thrust like the ocean itself is rising and pushing the boat forward and you watch avantika open her eyes and smile and looks over at fjord and goes well better luck next time huh the boat is now speedboating across the surface of the water the other rowboat left behind in its wake one die roll (laughter) as you approach the outskirts of the squalleater the rope ladders are thrown over the edge down into the water with that you all eventually climb up onto the top as some of the crew goes over to retrieve and ratchet up and bring the rowboats back onto the ship now you all clamber onto the deck of the large ship and take a moment of respite and breather as your-- the crew of the squalleater there awaits you can see there bouldergut the large ogre chief stands there arms crossed with the stretched leather tunic now strapped on each side of her torso avantika rises and vera waits her right-hand soothsayer-like assistant or for this would be considered the deckhand and spiritual leader of this ship yes you may i took mine off (laughter) that's true if there was any of us i would not be able to truly-- be certain-- yeah (laughter) it's okay so as you all bring yourselves onto the ship here vera approaches avantika and helps her to her feet and says like so how did it go tell us avantika shows her hand twas a resounding success i would say that our new compatriots have proven their worth with flying colors she goes and gives a (clapping) ow ow ow ow ow-- (laughter) at this point vera says captain at this moment it appears that we have maybe 11 days of supplies given that our crew has now swelled as such we could probably make it back to darktow to also complete the repairs on the mist as it is seaworthy but i do not know how long so that would be my recommendation maybe making a stop or two along the way whatever's close by the captain considers very well i guess we'll make our way westward onto darktow to get repairs done to supply up and should you wish to stay make our way to the next leg of our journey who knows it seems that you are up for your own rewards to be reaped eh of course well these gifts are paltry once uk'otoa is truly free then the true blessing can be given i have a lead on someone that should be in darktow that would be able to-- with the right amount of coin-- give us the information we seek hopefully if not we'll be sitting here with our thumbs up our asses but i've paid well enough and this person has come through before so fingers crossed eh regardless i think we could all use a bit of rest eh looks over to caduceus understood get jeremiah to get food cooking immediately i think a fine meal and a full night's rest is in order friends i'm impressed and i'm thankful that you've not only upheld your side of the bargain you proved yourselves as quite formidable mercenaries i mean no disrespect to some of my crew but when we get back to darktow-- she looks at some of the crew turn around some of them-- maybe we'll deal with some trade off eh send some of them over to the mist and maybe you'll stay with me for a while very well then we will get some sleep and on the morrow we will discuss how much money we can make together we'll probably make a stop or two along the way if you're interested bring up the map and see what you want to do when we've had a bit of rest maybe a glass of wine all right go rest sleep i shall do the same she walks back into her quarters vera staying there on the deck jamedi makes his way down to his quarters what would you like to do you can find a bit that seems a little more remote but there are deckhands there are folks that are always keeping watch you come to jeremiah you eventually start shouting until you find jeremiah jeremiah is this mid-40s halfling fellow pale but well-dressed in colorful silks and vibrant makeup from some of the theater productions you've seen he seems almost made up for the stage but just a cook big smile big curled waxed mustache hair parted and curled on the sides light brown auburn hair portly halfling fellow and as you're shouting his name he goes hello are you looking for me i'm jeremiah what's your name beau yes you're one of the new kids i am making food would you-- fine here you go he hands over a somewhat stale loaf no they are being prepared and i wish not to serve something that is unfinished (sighs) grabs a thing of wine a small jar and says you can fetch your own water all right you guys patiently wait for beau to return with a stale-- it was just sitting in a pool of water and you found that amongst other piles it seemed to be less of a temple and more of a scavenged artifact amongst a merrow den that was expanding beneath the swamp roll a history check this would be history technically actually history or religion you recall tales-- i mean there are many powerful creatures that have existed throughout history entities that are either elemental in nature or are primal forces of power there are some that are guardians of the world some that are guardians of the elements within their own planes there are many types of horrors and protectors throughout history thinking back to some of your studies both historically and in cracking the tome of the occasional religious thing against your better will in your classes there are some entities that were left in the wake of the divergence avatar-like entities or at least creations that were meant to be an extension of the power of the gods some of them are guardians in the world some of them still remain true to the religions or the gods that created them some over time have found their own interests some have grown obsessed with their own power without their creator and master to chastise or watch over them and see themselves as a new god even thinking back you don't have all the information but you do know that-- thinking back to the murals and things you've heard about uk'otoa being said uk'otoa was worshipped by the ki'nau which were the indigenous people of the menagerie coast and the swavain islands in the vicinity uk'otoa was one of these avatar entities that was created by zehir the cloaked serpent to be one of its many ambassadors of power and one of its greatest warriors in the conflict of the calamity essentially when zehir and the rest of the betrayer gods were banished along with the other prime deities they were now the most powerful beings on the surface of exandria as such new religions began to spring up around them the ki'nau of this area took to worshipping uk'otoa and uk'otoa began to preside like the next best god there was you get the sense that these other two entities might be similar relics of this time powerful beings created before or during the calamity and then left with their gods now sealed away to become forces of power of their own you don't know if they've been sealed in the same fate that uk'otoa was but based on what you saw in that temple they seem to be connected or at least have similar structure of worship if you were to find a place of deep research you could probably find more information about these entities yes yasha puts her hand on your shoulder and says faith is a funny thing be careful where you place it it can give strength or it can lead to terrible things fuming so you guys all go to rest all right you guys go to rest you head your way to the captain's quarters all right you head to the door it's closed (knocking) for a moment you hear this sound of rushing water okay it opens up it's the normal office den set up but there's the balcony out back that opens up and there on the balcony avantika is standing on the balcony and there's this column of water that is rising up out of the ocean she's nude it's washing her she's in the process in the throes of manipulating this water she's learning whatever this new gifted power that she has her hair is twirling up into the stream and it's this beautiful almost-dance between her and this elemental force that she now has she looks back over her shoulder at you knowing that you've been there for at least a couple minutes i'll be just a moment eventually the water splashes down and off the side she walks back out of the night air and pulls her hair up and ties it off she takes a little silk robe and places it over her and sits down there are already two glasses places on the table she uncorks it and pours two glasses to our success in time eh this is true not the best wine you've had but it's serviceable i am excited for you to experience this i've only but scratched the surface and i've never felt a connection like this with the sea that has been my life it's incredible i can only do it in bursts but i can cause it to swell and move and part and flood and shift it's-- (sighs) soon she reaches out and touches the top of your hand soon i promise now we were talking before and i think it's only fair she takes another big sip your blade is very interesting i knew one other who had a blade very similar referred to it as the sword of fathoms the previous chosen his name was vandren a fine sailor and a foolish coward he ended up to be but he was the one that opened my eyes to the destiny of uk'otoa we traveled together for a number of years before he just abandoned and absconded with something important i've been trying to find out where he went but he is very slippery wherever he is either what you have in your sword is what he took away or wherever he is he has the third with him he carried the same blade it is very much in our interests we were going to go and visit this very island some time ago when he was the only one to have one of these orbs well-- i had to kill a number of men it was being auctioned off in port damali and there was a collector word had gotten to us that this artifact was sold off to this individual well needless to say he put up a bit of a struggle thankfully this collector enjoyed nights long at sea and that happens to be our specialty his corpse now adorns one of the many beautiful islands and now i have this beautiful reminder the hand you can see it's now mostly healed over but there is a scar where this orb once resided in her palm as you're pacing she talks towards you it's very interesting that you carry the same blade as vandren did and come to me with what could very well be the same orb do you know this one this vandren make a deception check hmm who else was on this ship with you who was your captain she smiles i appreciate that you are a very accomplished liar but so am i the only reason why i still sit here before you with the dozen or so scars i carry is because i have been very keen at seeing through the same skill you know vandren don't you and he was on this ship that you shipwrecked on eh do you remember where this storm was do you remember where the storm was that sunk the ship you were on this was the last time you saw vandren i don't necessarily-- i have not seen vandren since he absconded with this-- many things but he will not travel with both that sword you carry and the orb he stole from us so wherever that ship has sunken there's a very good chance that it has the third missing orb do you remember where the ship sunk she reaches out and pulls out a map and rolls it out on the table in before you put your map up yes you do recall actually it was somewhere coming back along this trade route and somewhere in this space the storm had blown through this is where it sank and you washed up-- darktow's over here you washed up on this island here you guys are over there at urukaxl you washed up over here so the storm was in this vicinity then my friend i think we are going to do even more amazing things together i have been patient this long i can be patient a bit further very well she leans forward with the wine glass very close and goes it's been a very long day i think rest is in order she takes a big long drink of wine sets it down well there are ways to complete a hopeful future pact together many different ways (laughter) man all right quickly her hand grabs the back of your head and pulls you in she's a very powerful woman and you find yourself very quickly overpowered you are allowed to-- (laughter) no i'm never going to do that in a game sure go for it then that's your own-- (in despair) no no i wouldn't call it a romantic evening but a very-- union of two business partners of a similar goal and we fade to black you do fall asleep together unless you choose to not wish to i know roll a stealth check all right you carefully and quietly tiptoe your way through the hallway to your assigned quarters of which you are sharing with whom travis and one eye slowly opens as you are keen to be somewhat aware-- living alone out in the dangerous wood-- to any sort of aberrant noise in the vicinity you hear the faint creak of very gentle footsteps as fjord makes his way into your chambers you yeah (giggling) as you all rest a long rest at sea as the squalleater and the mistake make their way towards darktow to the far west we'll end tonight's game there and pick up there next week also everyone levels up everyone's level seven now (exclamations) to that degree while i have you guys here let's roll some hit points for those who are present over the next couple of days you will because this is a multi-day travel to get to darktow so your points of exhaustion will be gone by the time it matters it's your head man we reroll ones for hit points it's better there you go nott i reroll ones for hit points because rolling a one for hit points at a level up is the fucking worst what'd you get caleb four more hit points six points to you to be fair you guys have been rolling fucking great for hit points for many levels it's time for there to be some balance no take a good one dude (growling) i rolled good at hit points this is bullshit you're so weird sam how does it feel cheap but i reroll ones because-- i already said it as a player it's the worst feeling two sucks still but it doesn't suck as much as a one that's how i do it all right guys we're not going to sit here and subject you guys to us leveling up at the table-- although i'm sure there are a few that would love to see it we got the important part out for you guys we'll pick up here next week to see what's in store for the company of the squalleater of which the mighty nein have joined the union of partnership of captain avantika and fjord and the imminent darktow in your future
