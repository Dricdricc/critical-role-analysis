okay you begin to take the plume of smoke and filter into the dark rain clouds and you make the smoke go to a thicker thicker black and take the next few moments to begin sculpting in the air until eventually we have a very well-defined de rolo crest now staring down at the entire city of whitestone all right investigation checks from both of you what did you roll okay the two of you take a while upstairs looking about the rooms you manage to acquire from just some of the local bits of cabinets and dust you gather about 230 gold pieces just loose gold pieces that are around there is a nice jewelry box that seems to contain most of the jewels and gems that this individual likes okay so say a box of tylieri's jewelry would be what you've marked down there you go you do notice however that's all you're able to find for the most part other than some few bits of clothing and outfit the master bedroom has no bed okay okay as you make your way up there you notice them stepping out go for it investigation 16 you look through the room most everything of interest has already been picked clean this room also doesn't seem to see much use other than the clothing that's in there this room is used for dressing and presentational purposes but other than that as a bedroom it's pretty useless as you guys go downstairs we'll say for the sake of brevity you take a little bit of time to start looking through you know you're a little pressed for time because you can feel the energy in the town begin to rise and you start hearing noises you keeping an eye out the people that rush into the rooms are now rushing back out some of them wearing leather tunics and small bits of armor their weapons gathered and they're forming small bands okay you go over to this hallway you eventually smash the door doesn't take too long it leads into what looks like a small study or some sort of an office room a big blue rug a desk with a chair some papers strewn about yeah pull the rug off reveals a hatch okay glancing about you find what looks to be a general sitting area a music room or a place where you would host guests also in fair disuse and then beyond that you find a room that's pretty bland with a staircase that leads down into what was once servants' quarters that has been converted into a torture room it's a little nicer in its presentation and tools than the duergar torture room that you encountered in the underdark but this looks to be like tylieri had a definite interest in entertaining unwanted guests all right make a perception check yeah it does not appear to be trapped (vroom) the hatch comes up there is no ladder it's just a ten-foot drop down into a basement land down there a 20 foot by 20 foot room it's very musty however you do see in the far corner there is a pad of fresh earth set up and there is a dark box about eight feet long okay the room lights up a little bit and you can see across the way there is a not super-detailed but a fairly well-crafted coffin on the opposite side of the room okay the coffin does not appear to be trapped it's always fun to do that okay (boof) the lid flies off and then slams on the ground a smell hits you that's just like musty old mildewed earth the inside of the coffin is it's lined with like a fine purplish velvet material the smell quickly fades it looks like there are some small baubles in there keepsakes there is what looks to be a cape or a cloak that is laid across the bottom of this for comfort okay you cut through the purple velvet rummage through underneath it appears to be the back of the box okay want to make an investigation check as you're rummaging through the notes in the desk a lot of them are ledgers involving the trade in and out of the city he has his hands dabbling in elements of the timber trade elements of the actual trade of whitestone he talks about the-- and you understand the reason that whitestone itself is-- the stone that's mined here is so popular for construction and architecture and other elements is the stone that these mountains are made of when properly prepared there is a faint bit of residuum that is naturally ingrained in the rock here no one really knows how it came about but whatever it is while it is not inherently magical it makes it a little bit easier faster and cheaper to enchant the stone so when it comes to you know enchanting a teleportation circle permanently somewhere or for traps or things-- not actual objects but actually enchanting anything made of stonework it's easier to enchant and that's why the whitestone of this area is sought after and a good trade element so there's notes about that but the stone trade has been halted all stone has continued to be mined but it's not being transported no there's just notes about it so all the whitestone that is being mined is not being exported it's being kept here somewhere okay you take about 30 seconds of extreme violence against the wooden coffin killing it into chunks and blocks you get the feeling that this may have been the place the mist was trying to get to but it did not make its journey it got scattered by druid sunbeam and destroyed and the coffin is left in ruins you do-- even you grog-- absorb the fact that when a vampire goes to mist form you get the feeling that this is the home it needs to come to to try and survive not anymore not that one oh you see another zombie giant coming up the way you can see people attacking it it's just thrashing them about but this one seems less bothered by the group and is now moving towards a specific area moving towards the fiery plume in the distance they're all gathering in that direction not at the moment no all right you all gather you can hear the rainstorm itself is coming down in sheets what do you want to do okay you guys all step out into the rain (whooshes) pouring down what bits of guard blood that have been pressed against you washes off a flaming sphere begins to corkscrew around this room up over the banister up to the upper area and like an artist you paint this entire room with flame until the entire interior of this main foyer is just an inferno you can hear the flames licking and the light is very bright you end up backing up and you can see people unarmored folk in nearby homes that are pressed up against their windows watching this happen and whispering to each other the children those that are kept guarded and are not part of this rebellion they are watching this with smiles okay as you guys run off into the alley behind-- okay how many more spells do you have at that level because you used it several times today you guys all dart off into the alley under the cover of the shadows of the storm and the rainfall to head towards the alcove and we'll go ahead and take a quick break (cheering) we'll take it real quick because we want to try and get through as much of the story before we get to critmas which is going to which is going to take some time tonight be back here in a few minutes guys we'll see you in a sec welcome back so jumping back into the chaos the party has scattered back into the rainstorm i would like everyone to make a stealth check plus ten all right total ten okay well you're making your own stealth though you're invisible so just roll twice okay so making up for the bounding chaos that is grog throughout the city you manage to still make your way largely as a group stealthed to-- are you heading to the alcove you said correct all right you make your way to the alcove as you're darting through you can see in the distance small pocketed sounds of yells and the occasional sound of some sort of large-scale crumbling or crashing of wood and stone occasionally darting past the streets you see militant occupants of whitestone armored rushing through shouting orders to each other some coming back wounded and helping their friends back the midday rebellion has definitely started and you get the sense that the initial surprise has been effective but the longer this runs the longer this wears on the more and more of a body count this will be yeah you have not but you all meet up back at the alcove communicating over your earpieces you make your way to the front of the building the doors are closed and locked go for it okay seems to be a fairly simple lock make a perception check guys not you you haven't gotten there yet okay looking about there doesn't appear to be any set ambush or anybody else here you do hear the soft sound of pacing footsteps in the interior okay there's a pause and a voice goes who's us make a persuasion check i'll say since you're backing her failure up go ahead and make it with disadvantage 18 there's a pause crazy grandma come in you hear the sound of a locking sound and the door opens up ever-so-slightly a very very dimly lit interior there's a small lantern a hooded lantern across the room other than that you see the shadow of jordana as she ushers you all in out of the rain yeah apparently she closes the door behind you looks out the window that has the curtains closed and goes okay so it's underway it's not safe to be here right now did anyone see you come in good who are you you dropped seeming before all of this no that would've been amazing donkey eating a vampire head aw man you've just now gotten to that point you see the door closing as you get there what is going on okay you can rest here but how long all right right now i'd say you're close to three in the afternoon jordana to a few maybe i don't want to go outside right now best you could see that group was doing pretty well and was hacking it down lost a few of their number in the process there were six that you saw while you were doing your overall flight go ahead and roll insight sure go ahead best that you can tell she just looks genuinely scared and is uncomfortable with your presence right now but is letting it happen she's still getting over the fact that you guys look entirely different than when you first talked to her about staying here for the most part necromancy is not studied in this town at least we never had to deal with it until recently and we haven't had the opportunity to really study since you need a long rest they are two very different things all right so what's the plan yeah you guys go ahead use your hit dice to heal up while you're taking your short rest for those who've taken damage trinket technically does not trinket requires-- hit dice okay correct correct which correct percy percy percy no it's great just glad you didn't take the alertness feat then things would have gotten stupid well you guys are taking a short rest about 30 minutes to an hour so you have about two and a half three hours before it goes down entirely during this rest if you wanted to spend some time with that cape-- for the most part it doesn't appear to be enchanted that's not trademarked at all i love it all right so you guys have rested up through the rest you occasionally hear voices run by yelling as you guys get toward the end of your rest you hear the (stomping) large heavy footfalls heading nearby (groaning crash) a loud heavy impact and you hear some short cheers outside out front a little ways off not immediately yeah they got eaten by harpies okay jordana lets you guys out locks behind her i'm sorry no no all those were kept in either of the two temples here i already gave you everything of magic that i had here sorry as you step outside and look it's about 60 feet off near one of the big crossroads near this area and a zombie giant has been completely felled down and there are three people now that are currently in the process of hacking its head off just to make sure it's a group of about seven people that live here they're all looking pretty messed up but they're all eager and adrenaline-driven they're all hacking away then stopping and taking a breath (breathes heavily) you hear in the distance (thunder crack) bolt of lightning coming down from the storm and as it echoes everyone shakes for a second look at each other (cheers) give a cheer of victory they all hop off the body of the zombie giant and begin darting further in towards the center of the city it's there it's dissipating slowly but it's still there it's moved a little bit off-axis with the storm tylieri you do recall actually when you were interrogating the driver of the briarwoods tylieri was the master of the driver desmond who beat him and subjugated him to various forms of torture and abuse before lord briarwood took desmond and to try and show extension of faith revealed to desmond tylieri hanging from the sun tree that was true okay all right so from the alcove you guys head in a southwestern motion keeping off the main paths best you can the main chaos seems to have died down a little bit in this area of the town you come across another body of a zombie giant surrounded by what looks like eight bodies of civilians of the town no they are all very dead two of which are torn in half and just tossed to different sides one appears to be half-eaten and the rest are just smashed but whatever troop was with them managed to take the zombie giant down eventually you make your way to the center of the town square where the sun tree is and there is across the way on the opposite side what appears to be in mid-struggle one zombie giant that has a series of spears or javelins sticking out of its torso it's currently swatting at a group of individuals that have torches in the rain still trying to get up towards it and push it backward the sun tree at a glance-- roll a perception check yes okay active perception and passive perception-- passive is more something to keep track when you're not actively perceiving so grog okay keyleth you pick this out in the rain and it's hard to see but from this angle you see what looks to be eight ropes currently just dangling free from the sun tree you can go closer to inspect it if you want you're hearing in the distance the (roars) the battle's still raging about 65 70 feet from you you get up behind the tree and you take the ropes and inspect it all the ropes are very finely cut yeah and you do see there are a number this close you can see there are loops of rope all over the tree some very old and weathered and aged some of them are torn some of them are cut but the fresh ones that are the longest currently and that are placed closest to where the bodies were originally there are all very cleanly cut you glance around real fast and you can see to the south there is still the battle raging between the zombie giant and the crew of individuals but you look back where you guys were from and you see a large series of shapes stepping through the rain coming from the direction you guys were as you're having this conversation you keeping your eyes forward as he's saying this in your ear you can see as the light of the town is slowly beginning to vanish into a sunset-- it is still raining you see ahead of you coming from the central roadway into the square of the town what you can only surmise to be anywhere from 30 to 50 armored skeletal entities that are pouring from the north climbing the sun tree all right you guys see keyleth scurry up the sun tree okay (foghorn sound) the slow horn-blow comes out and this fog begins to fill the area between this marching skeletal army and the sun tree where you guys currently are looking over your shoulder you can see the zombie giant finishes smashing the last individual in that crew picks it up and jams it into its jagged giant teeth down the street towards you you can't tell now there's just fog along the way no you can't see them no because scanlan just created a whole bunch of fog between the two of you the moment you saw they may be about a hundred or so feet from you he can't control it well the fog this creates is a magical fog that obscures an entire area if you climbed to the very top of the tree you might be able to get a little bit of a visual okay make an athletics check athletics 15 okay you make your way up to the very precarious top of the branches you can feel the brittleness of it as the tree itself its life force is withered over time and some of it cracks and some of the actual bark of the tree twists off in your grip as you get to the very top you can look just over the bank of fog that scanlan has created and you can see beyond that the number of undead from this angle what was initially like 30 probably pushes closer to about a hundred starting about a hundred feet away slowly marching towards you all right what's the damage on that is it 2d8 bludgeoning and 2d8-- okay go ahead and roll for both and it's a save for half right total of eight eight plus what was the other one seven okay okay so the first area suddenly you see some of the clouds above you begin to funnel downward and a few bolts of electricity (crackle) through it as the funnel hits it grows dark and then all of a sudden this cold wind begins to swirl around it and with that the cloud almost seems to tear open within itself and a sheet of jagged ice and sleet begins to pour downward into the center of this undead horde as it does you can see probably a good 25 30 of these are just blown apart bone shards scattered around and you can see bits of rusted metal weapons and armor thrown left and right the ice then coalesces over the floor of this area and some of the skeletons just slip but they keep marching forward it definitely took a chunk but as it continues pushing forward-- you guys make your way down the tree as you get to the bottom of the tree the zombie giant has taken notice of the sudden flashing of light and the movement in the tree and is bounding towards the tree after you guys okay you hunter's mark turning around looking at the giant okay so you land and you cast call lightning the fog that you created scanlan has formed up you start seeing shapes these terrifying skeletal faces begin to appear through the fog as the rest of the army begins to push through the clouds coalescing above keyleth as you get your call lightning ready you marking the zombie giant you guys begin bolting out of the way trinket comes running up behind you vex and picks you up onto his back and you guys begin rushing off toward the treeline-- to the west or the east okay go ahead and roll damage on that i don't know how much do you get more on that call lightning would be 3d10 it does an additional d10 it does 4d10 okay no the one stonefell mentioned was the same it wasn't stonefell it was vouk but yeah he was referring to the same one 22 hits okay yeah for him still hits it's a big target big target lot of hit points damn (lightning sound) you can see the bolt strikes the front of the zombie giant right as it starts swinging after you guys the bolt hits its shoulder and blasts a chunk of its shoulder blade off you see bone shards fire behind and there's a giant piece of its torso now missing where the bolt hit (groans) stumbles back onto its back foot and catches itself almost toppling over it starts lumbering forward again as vex releases her arrow which splits into three nice (impact sounds) all the arrows blasting into its body you can see they sink in and burst on the inside there's a little a dull glow as this burst of electrical energy hits from underneath its sickly zombified flesh at which point there's a slight delay before it (explosion sound) bubbles forth and a bit of its internal liquid just spews out like a boil you can see it's definitely taking damage and it keeps pushing forward yeah it's still moving towards you guys it's about ten feet from you guys right now okay the moment it would take for you to stop and pull out bad news by the way the moment you guys are turning around to attack it it has gotten within range to hit so this is all happening simultaneously so it's going to get two strikes as you guys get your attacks as well so go ahead and roll your attack what did you get both hit okay and against percy that is a 17 and a 20 okay you take 16 points of bludgeoning damage as its fist comes down and (whack) slams into your side just as bad news fires off and your daggers go (dagger sounds) towards it okay good to know okay easy enough through the daggers-- it doesn't matter it still manages to keep its zombie form though it seems like every single hit you're taking chunks off its body but it continues to push through the damage until eventually it swings at you with the hit bad news goes off as it blasts through the center of its torso and takes out the back of its spine it can't keep its physical form together and as its body lunges forward you throw both of your daggers which go (thoonk thoonk) into each of its eyes it falls forward the torso seems to roll on impact and come after you like a slow-moving boulder for a few feet but since you're all moving forward you manage to outrun it just barely keeping out of the way the legs walk on their own for two more steps before it just falls forward into the mud relieving all its intestines into the rain-soaked ground you guys go running back and as you're looking over your shoulder you can see the skeletal army swarming the center of the square and pouring into the streets it seems that the briarwoods had their own reserve anti-riot campaign at the ready and with that we're going to conclude tonight's session (groaning) all right so we're going to take a little break here while we set up for critmas quick one very quick we'll be back here in just a few minutes for those who want to hang in and watch how ridiculously amazing this community is
