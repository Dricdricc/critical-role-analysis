good announcement i like it it's a good announcement let's see next up liam you wanted to mention something i recommend waiting until after the stream yeah you did you're a unicorn looks fantastic oh man that costume travis i think i mentioned it before-- i'm pretty sure in one of my games we've had a time (laughs) no there you go so ladies travis what are you dressed as (laughs) that's fantastic other side of the table let's see who are you dressed as sam that's okay we'll find some duct tape for you awesome it is awesome yeah your monkey's been a little rough oh that's amazing all right taliesin yes indeed because he vanished put that right there be careful or there's actually stabbing in real life as opposed to just the game today that'll be fun he'll learn in time i have a problem well the problem is being a huge fan of the witcher series for a long time but yeah that's our crazy halloween-ness we'll kick back here in just a minute to start the game and see what the wonders and dangers of whitestone bring to vox machina see you in just a second welcome back so to get you guys up to speed with the current situation in our currently non-air conditioned studio-- great day for this to coincide vox machina had an encounter with two individuals known as the briarwoods lord and lady briarwood who currently control whitestone the city that percival-- taliesin's character-- once lived in his family once essentially ruled before they were usurped and most of them murdered by the briarwoods so upon meeting them a vengeance urge kicked up within percival the rest of the party following him to whitestone to attempt to free the city from the clutches of the very seemingly evil and in some cases undead briarwoods as the lord briarwood appears to be vampiric in nature after arriving they had some stealth missions they went around and discovered a fair warning on the sun tree one of the central items of whitestone a relic of pelor from long ago that the city was built around now dead and holding a series of bodies hung from it all dressed and painted to look like the members of vox machina while they were there they managed to find and hole up in an abandoned tavern closing the windows off and after doing a little bit of digging spoke to the head of the lady's chamber the temple to erathis to which percival and most of the team seems to be interested in starting a rebellion in whitestone they planted the seed there to return to germinate at some point and then began to follow a couple of individuals or at least an individual that was partially responsible for the really honestly shitty social atmosphere in whitestone following him back to a home it was discovered that sir kerrion one of the individuals responsible for the death of percival's family was still part of the ruling class here the party then snuck in through the bottom of the building stealthed into a full surprise ambush upon him and his compatriots murdered most of them they took his toady essentially vouk and instead of murdering him tore out his tongue and then burned the de rolo family crest into his forehead-- i know but it's fun to push it that way but yeah with his tongue removed and the symbol burned into his forehead he was thrown out the window and the party then escaped into the night rain returning to their tavern and that was where we left off so as you guys come in from the soaking-wet rain that seemed to have been now pouring continuously through the city of whitestone you come to the quiet of your tavern the sun beginning to find its way setting across the evening sky what would you like to do i don't know what you mean what are you doing vax come on well we're going to learn i don't think scanlan's going to have a problem tonight you guys just now returned to the tavern it's starting to push later into the evening now you guys have returned to the tavern not yet it's been fairly fresh since you even started the word of it yes you were and you're finding your way through there doesn't appear to be anyone following plus there was a large distraction with sir kerrion's homestead being lit on fire the rain taking care of most of it but it drew people out of their homes to see this giant blazing symbol of the de rolo family burning across the rooftop so a message was definitely left and probably received by somebody and what are your plans you're back in the tavern where you guys were you guys have made your way to the inn if you all wanted to go down and to the tree-- okay all right okay do they you may 18 go ahead and roll a dice percival actually i'll roll it for you what's your bonus for both persuasion and deception okay he seems very earnest very broken confused but driven and there isn't any part of his voice that seems to conceal or attempt to hold back any information yeah go ahead and make a religion check suiting i mean there are all sorts of extraplanar entities throughout the realms that have their own individual descriptions you don't have a whole lot of experience outside of the realm of mortals you've had a few interactions with things that skew beyond that realm while you get that he's saying it may just be a dream you know that there are multitudes of creatures that thrive on these types of bargains you do know that many of these bargains in the long run do not end up being wholly in the person's favor who struck it you went to the alcove-- no you have not been to the alcove correct you went to the lady's chamber and you spoke briefly with keeper yennen and you went to beyond the horizon which was abandoned and partially collapsed yeah it's an arcane boutique yes right now i would say based on preparation the illusion-casting conversation you're looking at about 900 930 in the evening so you're looking for undead okay you feel a surrounding presence scattered throughout the city some large some small you can gather over a period of time of concentration you can feel the slow movement of the zombie giants moving through the city the sentinels slowly tromping through and a number of other undead entities there i would say yes there appears to be a little more haste and movement to what entities you can-- and you can't pinpoint specifics but you do sense that there is a heightened state of movement to what you've previously sensed so you're all down at the bottom of the tunnel by the roots of the sun tree and you have hallucinatory terrained the cellar what what's the dc of your spell of all your spellcasting what's the dc correct if something were interested in doing so so who's taking first watch okay it's tight quarters and you know other than either a magical light or torch someone wants to put up there is no light source it is pitch black down here what are you guys using as a light source or are you leaving it pitch dark all righty so you guys take first watch rest is till about 11pm or midnight or so you guys finish who's taking second watch all right we've got grog and vax all right so you guys-- as you guys are having this conversation the air down here it's damp earth it's chilled in the night anyway but it's a little warmer because you're under the ground and it's absorbed some of the heat of the day but it is getting noticeably colder yeah just as the evening progresses the temperature at night here-- comparable yeah there's a low mist begins to form within the tunnel from the temperature make an insight check yeah go ahead and roll okay you step forward and take a good long look at the fog that is slowly beginning to form at the base of the tunnel you guys are in as you lean forward and take it in the fog begins to form into a physical humanoid essence and reach out for you for the three that are conscious roll initiative all right so grog back in the fog vex is waking up the back trinket asleep next to her percy scanlan indeed all right this will go there for now i can't move in this great all right so get some initiatives on this for grog 17 all righty okay laura 22 all right and 18 good to know so vex grog then you rolled a what oh sorry vax vex you rolled a-- 22 right grog you were a-- 17 okay so grog this is technically a surprise round on you then we'll get back to you guys on top of the initiative you can see now the mist has formed into a pale humanoid with two more now that have rolled in these pale-looking intensely feral human beings with elongated fangs emerge from this mist and immediately lunge out towards you so first and foremost the one that lunges out at grog is going to shift to the side there is going to make a claw attack against you that is a 20 to hit that hits all right you take eight points of slashing damage-- or no you do not actually instead it is going to attempt to grapple you not attempt it grapples you so it reaches out and grasps on to some of the hide armor you have tied around your shoulder pulls you in and is going to attempt to sink its teeth into your actual body that's true (laughter) good that is a 17 versus armor class okay so it attempts to bite into you you move out of the way just in time and that little bit of chain mail that practically useless piece of chainmail wrapped around your giant thick neck does manage to catch its fangs and deflect the attack initially liam and this one is going to swoop in as you are now currently grappled by the other one it's going to attempt to grab you on the other side that is a 21 to hit so it's going to grapple you and this one is also going to now reach up with its claws to pull down the chain mail grasps you there since it's a surprise round natural 20 all right so you take five points of piercing damage and-- and 11 points of necrotic and your maximum hit points are reduced by 11 so this third one over here is going to attempt to come after you vax closest to it that is a 24 to hit okay to reduce the damage that's 2d4 slashing against you ten points of slashing damage yes it's going to try to claw you again that's a 12 yeah so the first one slashes across the side of your shoulder but you manage to pull out of the way just in time to lessen the impact this however sets you up for the easily dodged second blow you swoop out of the way just barely in time feeling the wind (whoosh) above your head that ends their turn now we're at the top of the initiative order surprise round this would not have been enough noise to wake you guys yet so you're going to hold on until somebody can get your attention top of the round will be vex you have nowhere to hide in this room unfortunately you get the idea that these creatures probably aren't largely affected by the dark okay the one that's most visible to you would probably be this one going after your brother you mark that one all righty go for it yes you did 31 definitely hits oh 31 damage (laughs) okay all righty no unfortunately it dodges out of the way its reflexes are very quick right so as you pull back you release and with a flash of burning energy your arrow ignites mid-transit it blasts and bursts into the vampiric creature who hisses at you (snarls) through the dark the second arrow however it's completely ready for and actually manages to swipe it out of the air with its clawed hand okay that ends your turn next up is vax correct dagger dagger dagger what you got yep yeah the first one was 18 yeah they all hit not a problem all righty cool so you click your boots of haste you feel the influx of adrenaline hit your body the magical push you take the daggers and (daggers flying) the vampire in front of you tries to swipe out of your hands but you're too fast you've already released all three before he even gets to your wrist and pull back grinning at it all three daggers (dagger impacts) repeatedly hitting nearly the same point like an amazing throwing of darts just smack smack smack into the center of the chest of the vampire across the way it's distracted by grog it doesn't see them coming until it is too late and it screeches out in pain (screeching) towards you the eyes help on this huh a nice and sizable chunk of damage all righty that ends your turn unless you want to try to move all right grog you're up please do all righty go for it 15 just barely hits yeah you are (chuckles) 16 on the first one all right that guy on the left the one that just got three daggers to its chest as the dagger vanishes from its wound it looks over at you at your already big grin mid-swing (wham) the warhammer blasts into its chest a burst of fire wreathing around its torso for a second it gets pushed up against the wall this time you go to swing with all your might on your second blow trying to smash it up against the earth that you guys have carved this tunnel out of it ducks out of the way in split-second timing and your hammer gets wedged into the side of the wall go ahead and make an athletics check nine it's pretty well wedged in there right now all right so now this one's going to shift over this way towards you percy as you're on the ground prone still just coming to consciousness he just (snarls) and lunges out towards you this one's going to move here placing in that position this one's going to stay there all right so the one rolling against you grog it still has you-- no the one that had you grappled walked away towards percy the other one's going to attempt to grapple you that was 18 misses you slap aside with your hand as you still try to pull the warhammer out of the wall and then it gets clotheslined by the grip you have on it it's going to try to strike you with its claws for the second attack that's a ten yeah no you (swish) out of its way laughing in its face the one against you percy where you're on the ground prone oh okay that'll be an 18 it grabs you by the front of your shit and lifts you up with that hissing sound yeah that'll be a 25 it pulls you in and sinks its fangs into the side of your throat you can feel yourself gasp out in pain as the cold sensation pulses through your body the actual life's blood being drained from you okay you take four points of piercing damage and you take eight points of necrotic damage and your maximum hit points are reduced by eight roll again so you're now grappled and held there it's pulling the blood out of your throat you're caught off guard and completely just confused frightened and in serious pain at this moment all right and the one that's hunter's marked that's against you it's going to attempt to grab you that's a 20 okay no damage it's just going to grab you and it goes in to attempt to go through your throat you being prepared for this having been subjected to this once before you bring a dagger up towards its face and it just barely manages to pull out of the way before you thrust it up through the bottom of its neck you manage to deflect the attack all right the people who just woke up roll initiative please which for the record scanlan as a fan mentioned to me this last week your jack-of-all-trades ability as a bard that gives you plus two to all things you're not proficient in also adds to your initiative technically so you have a plus two to your initiative i've had this brought up multiple times if it's not true it's been clarified by a couple of publications that have been sent to me when i questioned it we'll consider that hat the plus two bonus oh snap scanlan next to vax nice 12 all right percy wow all right so we are now at the top of the round this puts us to vex and percy going simultaneously you know what yes go ahead and roll your first attack yeah all right so unfortunately the first arrow-- there is too much movement to the bodies it doesn't strike true so you do not have advantage on this check acrobatics or athletics your choice all righty 28 you manage to break the grapple you can yes technically yeah all right go for it (laughter) it's a plus-one rapier but your archery you took i think was your combat correct to what you normally get so you have a overall plus one no sorry minus one is the total from what you get for your pistols for your pepperbox the magical rapier offsets that a bit 25 hits go ahead and roll a third time okay so the first strike sinks true that's 1d8 plus what's your strength modifier well no it would be dex plus one damage on top of that because it's a plus-one weapon nine damage all right so your first swing the speed of your ability to break this grapple and then immediately pull this weapon and jam it forward it pierces part of the body and pull out the creature all of a sudden reaches over and grabs its side instinctually you go for two more strikes however being the first time in a long time that you've ever held a rapier and still with your other hand holding your throat in severe pain it flings forward twice the second time the creature actually grabs it and pulls you in towards it so yeah you're now considered re-grappled so you can take another attack oh 18 plus stuff yeah go ahead and roll damage this is against the one that's on percy still or the one that's against your brother too late 16 all right this arrow however does manage to sink into its side it protrudes about four inches from its body it's pretty deep into its torso breaking a couple of ribs but you see the creature being the undead nature of its physicality it's not looking too great but it's not at the end of its rope right now all right that ends that scanlan you're up there are three of them yes you can currently yes so scanlan you use your movement to pee can you do that i don't know if you can use multiple slots on a turn can you it creates an additional dart per spell level so it's initially three and it's three levels higher it gets to six essentially yeah i'd be 6d4 plus six and they hit automatically there is no roll for it no they unerringly hit they're like homing arcane projectiles six times i know okay so five against him all righty all righty so as you get up-- i think scanlan is pretty proficient in this i'm just saying all right so happy halloween okay so as you sign your signature on the ground you also burst forth with a series of arcane bolts that streak across the room slamming into the sides of each of these vampires they all look towards you as a reaction to the pain and their heads all turn curiously as to what they see not what they were expecting all right that's your movement and your action i think that's your turn right if you want to use one yeah all right take your d10 inspiration die grog oh man i get a d10 inspiration for that good night everybody and we're done all right vax you're up all right vax is now going after grog right grog you're up okay you can use one of your attacks to go ahead and make an athletics check yeah you (sucking noise) pull your hammer out without an issue you're embarrassed at the fact that it was even embedded in what is essentially hard earth and you still couldn't pull it free but now it's blazing with flames it's tight in your grasp what are you going to follow it up with okay yes you can 21 hits yep both hit go ahead and roll damage plus ten to each to which one the one that's next to percy or the one that's in front of you here all righty all right 29 damage jeez so the one that's harassing you chuckling at the fact that you've currently been unable to really prove your might as a goliath in front of these individuals you grin as you pull it back and (wham) slam it directly in the face of it it rears back (growls) confused for a second you can see a crack in its jaw and blood beginning to trickle down its jaw you pull back and slam it a second time this time with a resounding crack sound as part of its jaw is dislodged and set to the side its tongue dangling out and dark black blood begins to pour from the center of its mouth as it looks to you with absolute fear that was pretty rough all righty you want to do anything with your movement all right this one okay it will get an attack of opportunity on you are you cool with that all right with advantage because reckless attack that is a 22 all right you are raging so you take ten points so now five points of slashing damage all righty that brings us to vax now it is your turn no grog moved away all right so those all hit (dagger impacts) you jam the dagger into its torso it's trying to stop and slap the hands away but you're too fast and the final hit you push it up and you're right in its face again you can see its fangs still wet with the blood that it pulled from your throat and you grin at it back as you withdraw the dagger with much force and anger getting that on a jacket now vampires ain't shit all right cool that ends your turn unless you want to move or do anything else all right now it's their turn you notice by the way this round specifically as they're looking a little more wounded their flesh begins to slowly reform the wounds they've taken begin to seal up and the pouring of blood begins to slowly turn into a trickle it's true all righty this one's going to move up to here yeah you're last i mean you'll be getting up this turn well you're awake you woke up you're just prone real grog-gy sorry i'm so sorry it's canon (laughter) yeah only time that it works speaking of which percy it's your turn oh i'm sorry it's their turn on you there's two of them now ganging up on you natural 20 that's a 20 and a 15 all right well you take 14 points of slashing damage from the claw the second attack it attempts to slash you a second time you manage to dodge out of the way putting your back up against the wall to barely avoid its grasp however the second one lunges towards you attempting to grab you that is a 19 19 hits no damage but now it's grabbed you and shoved you up against the wall it takes one hand and jams it up under your chin to push your head up and goes for your throat rolls a one as it goes to bite your throat you pull pepperbox up and jam it into its mouth it (choking) it has to pull back from the attack and you can see now this vampire saliva is all over the barrel of the gun and it may have chipped a tooth all right that finishes their turn keyleth you're up there's two of them right there on percy they have him grabbed and shoved against the wall there's one over here that's battling back and forth with vax at which one you're probably going to have to move to get them both in a line you can move there to do it yes okay so you slide alongside scanlan-- yeah no you were technically in melee with this guy but there is no attack roll so you don't have disadvantage which is good all right so well yeah go ahead and do that each creature has to make a constitution saving throw it's 6d8 radiant damage and they have disadvantage on the saving throw because they are undead so the first one-- that is a 14 nope second one no third one-- no rolled a one all right so all of them take full damage okay well (chuckles) so both of these vampires currently have percy pinned up against the wall one of them is trying to bite his throat and percy's trying to keep it at bay with his weapons keyleth you step forward-- right you feel the inspiration based on the presence of the sun tree and what previously you were attempting to try and repair it with using that you close your eyes and a burst of sunlight energy cascades forth slamming into both the vampires and barely missing percy in the process both of them look over out of the corner of their eye as they see the flash of light they both scream out (screeches) as the blast shoots through both of them both of them immediately turn to ash and are strewn against the far wall there is one alive yes that's right next to you currently yes this side here okay is it a bonus action for grasping vine what's the roll for that i'm looking for the roll for grasping vine real fast dexterity saving throw with the dc it's 17 18 no that gets it all right that brings us to the top of the round vex and percy it's your go all right go ahead and roll for a melee attack correct and you're using your dexterity as the bonus simple weapon which you're proficient with that is a 19 does hit yes roll for second attack 14 does not hit all right so go ahead and roll 1d4 add your dex modifier all right so you take the heavily-sharpened wooden dagger essentially you jam it into its chest it screeches out in pain the wooden stake itself partially destroyed in the process of jamming it in to do so much damage it reaches up grabs it and breaks it off and part of it still in its chest goes (growling hiss) hisses at you angrily all right that ends your turn yeah that was two attacks well he's not currently grappled per se he's just held against the wall you can still move away if you want it'll just take a swipe at you okay trinket is cheering you on (bear noises) from the back wall percy you're not entirely certain you know that sunlight is very damaging to it and from your research you know that vampires of certain levels of power as opposed to dying turn into a mist form and attempt to retreat 28 hits hits all right all three hit all right ten points got it all right so you slam the rapier three times into its body leaving these large gaping wounds it's looking like it's hurt and its eyes are darting about gauging its chances that'll be your turn unless you wish to move okay so you're back there as you back away it sees the opportunity and reaches out with its claws towards you that is a nine okay all right that ends your turn percy scanlan you're up yeah it's right here you're right there (chuckles) okay yeah it is that was about 3d4 worth there we go yeah it's a wisdom saving throw no it does not make it with a six so you cast vicious mockery at 3rd level it's 3d4 damage it does take it and it has disadvantage on its next attack roll no i was thinking of another spell go for it eight points of damage how do you want to do this (cheering) so as it's trying to take its chances it turns to go ahead and flee sees grog looks over and hears you going hey toothy looks over back at you one of the weaknesses of a vampire is running water technically it needs to be a large amount of running water but this creature is on death's door and based on the fact that it is right on the edge of passing out anyway the bit of your-- yes streaks across the front of the vampire as it turns around grog just instinctually slams it with the hammer and smashes it into the ground it's hard to say which killed it but you're pretty sure it was you which for the record as you high five him there is a bit of spatter across your hand right now it's a little after midnight go ahead and make an intelligence check yeah it's hard to say you don't understand a lot of the nature of undead it's not your forte and things have been weird around here you have no idea all right it is and you're surrounded by a number of bottles of wine-- pop open the wine share a bottle and you all manage to find your way back to sleep who's taking watch now okay so you two take the next watch (chuckles) all right the three of you take this watch all right a few hours of awkward conversation-- it's geralt thank you very much i will attack both of you (laughs) oh man all right so after you guys take your watch with seeming no incident although some awkward conversation and a few jabs here and there final watch who's taking that all right grog is up and trinket does like staying awake with you grog you both understand each other on a very feral and unintelligent level eventually everyone's managed to gather your evening's rest you come to consciousness the cold morning greets you no seeming further incident in the cellar during the evening i would like everyone to make a wisdom saving throw please wisdom saving throw your thing help you okay wisdom saving throw there you go okay keyleth so as you all come to consciousness i would like you to put another point of corruption on your sheet tell you in a second oh you're still coughing you guys all come back to consciousness cold morning greets you food probably is going to be in order pretty soon you guys didn't get much of a meal the evening before and you're all still a little sore after your evening's rest you've pushed through and recovered from your exhaustion from your frenzied rage you guys looked through you found some jerky some dried food that's serviceable not the best but serviceable all right going forward the sadistic tendencies that you've been exerting through a lot of this event are becoming harder and harder to control be mindful that when you strike to kill you strike to torture before you do yep everyone else rolled above a ten all right so you finish your meal looking outside what little bit of the windows you can see since you covered them all with cloth there's a little bit of daylight peeking through it's soft daylight it looks like while it's not raining there is still a cloud-covered sky what is your plan of action those hit points have all come back by the way guys over the night the hit points you lost on your hit point total have been returned yeah from the bite that recovers after a long rest what don't-- my brain doesn't work-- (laughs) it's hot in here gnome bard wizard over here there you go okay good to know all right dorito a strange elven term for flatmate all right so as you guys press out into the day's sun we'll take a quick break we'll be back here in five minutes to continue this see you guys shortly [break] oh yeah i used to have that man you should be baron samedi for that one he's one of the characters you can play in that god that thing was so awful it's going to be so great whose turn is it you you are banished oh that guy was so good (laughs) man nightmare that's almost as good as experience bij all right so quick announcement we have for you guys right now as well tonight's episode if you haven't seen from the setup is actually sponsored by tor books which is awesome if you guys aren't familiar with tor you need to go check out what they have i grew up reading a lot of the stuff that tor published they're one of the major publishers of science fiction and fantasy out there they've been going for a long time i was raised on a lot of their spectrum right now they're pushing the awesome new york best-selling book shadows of self yes that's the one which felicia really really enjoyed and if you guys have the opportunity to go check it out please do so their stuff is awesome so thank you tor i think that's it so if everyone's back here let's go ahead and-- oh there he is i was waiting for burt to return oh it's a sleeping monkey you ever been mistaken for a man come on you've got to know the response to that thank you laura grog has disadvantage on his next attack (groaning) yeah probably we'll see when we get there all right so down (laughs) i will quen all over your ass i got aard signs all day yo all right anyway so what are the groups you guys are splitting up across the city good so he was shot in the face by percy this was vouk based on this conversation happening now no you have already transformed everybody into the original-- except you have a lazy eye which is different yeah you do crazy old woman eyes just like that indeed so you and scanlan continue off into the city okay all right there is a radius to it i believe they have to stay within a certain area of you i can just look it up right here i would do that yeah i would recommend looking up your spells the alcove would be on the northwest side of it the four of you head off towards the alcove heading out into the day the cloud cover is pretty thick there is just general moisture and mist to the air it probably could rain any second you continue moving towards the northwestern side of the town you do notice in comparison to previous days there is a little more energy to the streets people seem to be moving back and forth with hustle and business you do also see as you head on your way out there is still a slight bit of smoke slowly swimming up from the house in the distance and what minor embers were not put out by the rainfall it's just a little trace of smoke that was the eastern yeah that one is partially burned down so as you continue heading northwest you eventually make your way to where you recall the alcove was now when you get there it's a relatively plain-looking building dark woods there's a sign out front that says the alcove it's old the metal that holds the sign has rusted a bit the doors are open and as you push into the building it's largely empty and seemingly unkempt compared to the previous oddity shops you've been to many books about enchantment look left out on one of the nearby tables partially read and abandoned as if they were being flipped through and then as you look across the room behind the counter there's a young girl in her late teens a blonde waif of a girl who's currently thumbing through a book and notices you guys enter oh hi can i help you simon was called away for a special project by the briarwoods about six months ago he told me to look over the store while he's gone i'm sorry we're mostly out of stock we don't have much here at the moment i don't know he lives in the castle now i mean he would visit every week or so but he hasn't been back in almost a month and i'm a little worried no unfortunately he was the real enchanter here i'm just trying to do my best to learn what i can while he's gone she gives you a look and looks about the room for a moment the briarwoods have been very fair and just rulers of this land she's gathered as much and is seemingly offput by the whole presentation the briarwoods are just and fair and we should not speak ill of them in public make a perception check looking around the room there doesn't appear to be any specific devices installed whether magical or otherwise that would pertain to immediate-- she leans in a little bit and goes hold on and she runs off behind the counter heads back and closes the doors behind where you guys entered heads back and gets behind the counter i'm sorry i don't recognize any of you and you're bringing up rather dangerous statements what can i help you with we don't have much and she reaches down and pulls out a couple of small glass vials simple healing potions you can already see you've worked with these type of things before she pulls up a small metal rod one of these okay she gives you a look and says it's dangerous to draw that around here sir she gets a little more comfortable as soon as you do what are you doing here here why the briarwoods are after you i can't have you here you'll bring them right to me make a persuasion roll yes big number it's a very large die i'd say no not at this point you're the one that originally spurred her worry she gives you a look look if i'm going to let you stay here i need to know more about what it is that you're trying to accomplish here raising the symbol of the de rolos i've never seen any of you in the city before in my life anything's better than this misery she shakes her head and foolish minds the de rolos have been dead for five years really this moment of tension with jordana awkwardly staring at these all very intently looking dirty peasants with a donkey just talking about names make a persuasion roll [no audio] immovable rod but yes one greater healing and two regular all right she pushes it all towards you guys and says i have practically no one and i can't be much help i'm not a fighter all right follow me she leads you to the back and there's this very very small room that looks like it used to be her father's room it's dusty most of it has been untouched except for the bed she walks in this is all i have to offer it's not much but it's available as safe as anything is here just don't go outside it's about nine feet up maybe about two feet of rafters very simple very plain sure go for it okay it's hard to tell she's young and she seems definitely earnest and plain with her forthrightness yeah there doesn't appear to be any sort of deception it's kept but i recommend talking to keeper yennen if you haven't he's one of the social centerpieces of the remaining good folk in the city his reach is far he'd be the one to talk to well don't stay here long that will draw attention her shoulders slump a little bit she's like all right i'll prepare as best i can and she starts reaching over and starts pulling these thin blankets out from a nearby cabinet and goes well go all right now you guys after about a minute or so of walking you do see what looks to be a young man carrying a satchel over his shoulder it looks like it's filled with a few small pieces of parchment that are rolled up he's in a brisk walk somewhere if you're looking for a drink and he points over down the road and he's really put off by it and is trying to keep his face out of your breath you're going to look for the journey's end two blocks down that way to the right it's not much business during the day as you walk away you hear him mutter under his breath what's this world coming to and he continues on his brusque pace you are now at the journey's end tavern it's pretty barren you walk inside there are two employees one who is behind the bar and is currently reading through a book the second is currently pouring a drink for the one patron that's in there what looks to be a slovenly looking gentleman who's sitting at a table drinking his woes away he's currently going through what looks like a ledger of some kind and there's a tavern employee with an apron on he's this younger red-headed boy who's trying to fill a flagon while this gentleman at the table is cursing at him to the side other than that it's empty three all right okay i'll be right back and he walks off looking a little confused (chuckles) that's cute water it is and he's walking off the patron now a closer look man in his late forties has a protruded jawline little bit of an underbite thinning brown hair and he's got some smears of dirt on his face looks like he's been crying and is slumped over the table looking over this ledger he slams it shut as you sit down with a very very loud (impact noise) glances sidelong towards you and says what the fuck are you doing coming and bothering a man in the middle of his meal you're telling me ain't no living to be had in whitestone these days it's nothing but misery that's the worst fucking part is you know there's always an easy exit what you think the folks who've taken their life to this point you think that's the end but no not in this town no they just get right back up the next day there is no way out talking about the whole business there is no escaping this misery either you try and stay alive and exist in this bullshit or you die and become one of them i've been trying to find a way out of this city for months now but they're always watching that ain't going to happen mate sorry no it's okay let the boy speak let your boy speak what were you saying (laughing) man that's a layered check make a persuasion and a deception roll back to back yes what's your bonus okay so 29 i was like (explosion sounds) all right gives you a stern look huh well it'd be nice for a change that there'd be someone up to fucking fight for this shithole of a place he goes oh no no need for that going to make me lose my appetite hate the sound of a grown man crying chin up and he takes and flicks a coin at your face look if what he's saying's true and we've got some sort of savior making their way into town well let's hope they're at least a little more prepared than the last ones the uprising three years ago are you new to this fucking town okay first and foremost you've got to treat your boy better going to raise someone no better than the motherfuckers running whitestone right now if you keep this up i think you should but one thing if he ever does anything else to hurt you again you come tell someone two if you hear anything else about this savior coming into town go ahead and talk to trevor over there at the edge of the bar and you see over there there's the guy who's behind the bar with his book he doesn't even notice all this happening guy in his mid-thirties glasses at the end of his nose his hair's slicked back and pulled into a taut ponytail and he's sitting there reading and he says go ahead and tell trevor because the rest of us would like to go out in a blaze of glory than live in this bullshit not important to much but you can call me patrick he's listening in go for it he seems honest seems he's got not much to lose and his interest is piqued but he's not wholly invested in this whole idea but it's definitely caught his attention well let's get him up stands up reaches over and grabs you by the arm lifts you up onto the stool on the side of the table and says up you pats you on the back you need to sober up drink the water you got for your boy there and get your ass out of here he gives you a keen glance and nods slowly as you walk away looks over at the bartender for a second and psst trevor and then you exit the building all right you guys all convene at the lady's chamber the other day there were a few folks walking through the courtyard today there's a group of about 25 people all different dress from what would be considered a whitestone middle class the few there are to a number of other peasantry farmhands and other folk that look destitute by nature of existence here all gathered in the amphitheater and what appears to be a relatively hushed sermon or discussion currently going on by keeper yennen okay sit in the back he begins talking for a while about a long tangent speaking of this land once cherished is a burning light and a beacon of good existence of kinship of honesty and loyalty dragged down to the muck by the imposition of darkness the return of the evil that once scourged this land now given new faces they push us down and as hope crumbles the light peeks through once again for whispers have come to my ears friends that this unrest now has a name i'm sure you've seen it the fire atop that building this morning watched as one of your oppressors was cut from his high throne one of his close advisors scarred tortured shown the strength of this hidden ally of us the oppressed peoples of whitestone and he looks up over the group a little bit and past the streets carefully i have come to believe that perhaps this is the time for us to band together and show our support now the information is still vague but just keep your eyes open be careful be quiet as things progress word will find you bows his head and says a prayer that-- none of you speak celestial all righty the essence of the prayer is by the guidance of the lady may civilization flourish and those that keep progression at bay be squashed beneath our feet at which point the sermon breaks and people begin to walk away and scatter everyone is silent everyone is quiet and everyone is looking warily and making their own separate paced exits so as not to draw attention okay you keep as best a mental image of everyone who's passing by not too many notable folk they look like especially where you're from the peasantry doesn't really interest you visually but you do manage to gather details of certain scars here and there and people hair color age stuff like that keeper yennen actually scanlan you and keyleth both recognize some of the farmers you guys have all gathered you recognize two of the individuals at this were the farmers you initially saw on the outskirts of whitestone when you did your little scouting mission earlier yeah so from all the people you've encountered those are the only two that you specifically recognize so far but it does appear to be made up of-- yeah the foundation of this city that have been so long oppressed okay you can see as he begins putting out some of the incense he looks over and sees ah yes you've returned please follow me and he steps outside of the amphitheater and around the back of it okay around the back of the amphitheater you see there is constructed attached to the very far end of this round half-dome a square brick building very simple and as he ushers you all inside it's essentially a tea room there's a table there's a tea set up there there is a small stove in the far end with a little fire-burning stove and shelves and shelves and shelves arranged with all different manner of small sculptures metalwork holy symbols of erathis that have all been put on display each one has a name carved beneath it and you recognize this percy this is the legacy of all the keepers of the lady's chamber over time their symbols this is basically a hall of previous keepers please sit have tea if you like if you're so interested we have much to discuss so i am to believe that these allies you spoke of previously were responsible for this dastardly attack on sir kerrion well i have spoken privately with a number of the remaining community leaders of our town and they are unconvinced understand this isn't the first time an insurrection has been attempted and much sorrow was endured after previous failures we keep hope best we can but without a solid plan we are sending the rest of our able-bodied into the abyss well in a similar fashion we had a number of fed-up individuals decide to finally raise some sort of aggressive act against the castle and attempt to storm it by force we figured we had the numbers there are many dangers in that castle that go beyond what we were prepared for as such the few that survived well they met the fate most do at the sun tree these days so we've been remiss to put ourselves in a similar position for many years now to make matters worse our informant within the castle has gone silent these past few weeks we have no idea of the progression of the briarwoods' plot no simon has been missing for some time actually i don't know the name the information comes through-- actually he should be arriving here in just a moment all that we know is they've been rebuilding or repurposing something old and terrible beneath the city i've only heard whispers of it referred to as the ziggurat laura travis and now to go into the deep history of this city as you are outsiders legend speaks of a seed that the sun tree was placed by pelor himself to seal a wound in the light whitestone rose around it the fable has long been told but ever since those fiends took the city their interest beneath the city has kept me thinking on this fable leaves me very unsettled and as the sun tree slowly died so did our confidence further-- at which point the door across the room opens (creak) and another enters the room a very elderly man steps in his ragged robes draped on his very thin frail form his weathered skin is dark and leathery he's nearly hairless on his head and has liver spots all over his scalp one of his eyes is clouded over and white he shimmies in very slowly i ask you strangers what makes you so sure you can change the tide of this battle as old as he may be there is a subtle power and resonance and confidence to his voice there's a force of personality and conviction that immediately leads you to believe that this man is or once was a man of great power and respect there are two windows they are currently shut with curtains you percy recognize this man he was once the chancellor to your father and a long-respected philosopher in whitestone known as archibald desnae desnae he was very well-respected very stern and crotchety at times but very much aided your family in holding the city together in times of strife reaches out and his long spindly fingers wrap around the tome pull it towards him so you bring a trinket that is helpful but to kill one mortal man is no feat compared to the darkness that lies in that castle you need more than that i'd say you can drop it on an individual if you prefer okay there's a slamming sound as the tome he's holding hits the floor percival sweet percival i thought you had perished in the subjugation percival you have no idea the joy this brings to my heart and he reaches out and touches the edge of your face like he's still in disbelief your hair it seems age has caught up to you as well you see a smile creep across his very tense old-man face and he looks about the room with a renewed energy that wasn't there before with you here percival we've two de rolos spearheading the rebellion we have the guiding light the people need we must succeed percival if this fails there won't be anyone else left to rise up they are nearing their goal according to your sister cassandra we haven't much time your sister lives percival she survived the attack and was taken as the personal assistant and slave of the briarwoods and used as an example a symbol of their dominance she has been feeding us information for years whenever she could she was the helping guide the last two attempts we've made we have not received a letter from her in weeks now but know you are not the only surviving member of your family i will talk to your people i will talk to mine we'll have your militia guide us percival fredrickstein von mussel klossowski de rolo iii guide us vox machina some of us have information all over these lands we've had a few friends come from emon over the past couple years they met some dire ends don't think that we haven't heard of your exploits help us bring a dawn back to this land professor anders has been lost to us since before the insurrection he is a man taken by what promises the briarwoods have given him what little he has shown his face in this town he is not the man he once was or at least the man we thought he was was never who he truly claimed to be he lives in the castle with the briarwoods as well she did there have been reports in recent days that she's been quick to pack we know not where she resides now here and he takes a moment to think of which house you're referring to yes you did the house is kerrion's house and then there are two other homesteads of the new nobles one of which is currently held by the duke he says with disdain goran vedmeyer vedmeyer he has supposedly been put in watch at the temple of pelor but he's left that to ruin the other home houses count tylieri a rather sadistic man who oversees the timber production of whitestone timber briefly tylieri the briarwoods when they took whitestone did not take it alone they came to this land with a small army of cutthroats mercenaries sell-swords they brought over from whichever forsaken land they came from each one of those men that then proved to be of utmost use to them in that rebellion they were given titles and nobility and homesteads they were given responsibilities over the land the people beneath them i can only assume that was part of their payment for their service as far as i know yes not to my knowledge count tylieri is known for being quite the sadistic individual beating torturing his servants sometimes publicly to show his hand to those who would cross him he would definitely be a message to send if there were one i would warn the longer we wait making these messages the stronger we build this part of the city but also the more warning and preparation time we give to those in the castle so the choice is yours the name tylieri catches your ear's memory if you recall your captive back at greyskull keep was previously the owner of the driver of the briarwoods desmond the one that beat him senseless until eventually lord briarwood saw this and then took him as his own driver the mists are a means of intimidation it's merely a magical precursor to the undead minions of the briarwoods they slink through those mists use them as cover if you see it run in the castle yes there are vents in what was once the garden i know not the nature of these vents or what is being utilized to produce this foul noxious odor but it has put a scent on the city for many years we know not the few times she's walked the city it's been procession and power she seems to enjoy the attention she's a vain one that one she hasn't in almost a year but she has before yes she walks in the sun unlike her husband yes it's hard to say it's a tough decision the symbol does carry the weight of the people and does carry a beacon of hope but it as you said may put your sister in danger it's hard to say the choice is yours in how you wish to use it yeah controlling weather on that scope is a little beyond your grasp you can alter elements of it and you could darken elements of the cloud to form a message or a symbol if you would like but actually removing the clouds that would be-- okay yeah write down arrow with a question mark it looks heavily tinkered it's a little front-loaded with the weight yeah (laughs) yes what cool have thoughts keep them going arrow by this point in the day it's probably around three in the afternoon with a crack of thunder rainfall begins to hit on the city the northern house is the one that count tylieri currently resides in or no my apologies the northern house is the one that duke goran vedmeyer currently exists in the other is count tylieri all right did you put your hat back on okay yes because you're very much visibly percy all right so you groups divide scanlan heading towards the northeastern house the rest of you heading towards the northwestern house eventually you get to the outskirts of both abodes and you can see the dark clouds in the sky occasional claps of thunder and flashes of light even though it's midday it's pretty dark right now the few folks that are out and about have their heads covered with hoods and they're trying to stay under overhangs to stay nice and as dry as they can you are all soaked to the bone at this point just pushing through your cough is still setting in pretty heavily at this point too you guys make your way to the outskirts of the home you scanlan skipping along the boy that you are with your one weird wandering eye find your way to the other abode so what's the plan it's about 25 30 feet and the house that you're looking at right now it's very well-crafted looks like it's made from a lot of the fine timber of whitestone the lighter woods and dark woods contrast with each other stained to show the variation in the two it's a very beautiful home currently you can see there is one guard visible at the front that's all you can see at the moment there is a second guard around back that is just now stepping out of an outhouse that is situated behind the building okay all right keeping a close eye through the dark rainy atmosphere you can see on both homes the interiors are slightly lit there appears to be individuals at home in both homes you just can't see who it is necessarily there is light in the interior as you turn into a fly and make your way this little boy just walks and (zip) go ahead and make a stealth check okay you turn into a fly and make your way through the bars and begin (buzzing) over the yard with your one-twentieth of a hit point in fly form make your way any of the nearby windows all seem to be shut the front door is closed there might be a gap but the guard is standing in front of the door okay he takes notice of your buzzing as you go by and goes back to his watching the rest of you guys right this house is also well-built sturdy mostly wood construction but it's all dark wood it almost seems to disappear against the gray skies above it if you're looking from a downward perspective it's a very dreary-looking home built to look pretty for someone who doesn't like a lot of color it's two stories there are a number of windows on both stories looks like there is a small garden out front that has been long-ignored and died and dried up just browns abysmal-looking other than that there's not much else to say on the building not currently any guards outside of it no (laughs) and you stay within 30 feet of him can you stay within 30 feet of him all right both of you guys roll stealth there you go 36 and 38 boom (laughs) immediately just like that you push into one of the nearby alleyways curve around the side and make your way to the back portion of this and the gate is buttressed up against one of the surrounding buildings-- it's a warehouse of some kind-- to the point where there's a little bit of space you can get over but it's about eight feet up and it is a spiky top but looking over you do see there is one guard that is slowly patrolling around the outside and you see through the nearby window what looks like two humanoids that just crossed paths at the front of the window correct basically you didn't see it from your perspective once you went around the alleyway to the other side of it you do see there is one guard that is slowly patrolling the outside i'm going to say roll an intelligence check with advantage because you're a bard just add your intelligence modifier okay through your bardic research and hearing many tales and seeing scribblings in books of presumably madmen apparently that there were certain creatures that existed long before the civilization had taken root you have heard of some of these one of which is the mighty and frightening triceratops you hear it's just a fable but it's fun to pretend to be one sure yep and out of nowhere this tiny fly (boosh) into a triceratops (boom) lands crushing the man beneath you he's going to attempt to-- oh rolled a 20 on his saving throw so he's only going to take half damage go ahead and roll 3d6 crushing damage 17 whoa okay he did not like that okay he is crushed and he is prone beneath you right now (groans) all right go ahead and roll an attack okay yeah go ahead and roll another 3d6 nine plus three 12 points of damage you turn around and with a loud cracking sound the whole outside of the doorway and most of the outside of the room is thrashed and destroyed wood chunks go flying everywhere with a large roar you see part of the inside of the foyer collapses from that side of the building you basically take out a whole support and start thrashing around you hear voices begin yelling out from in the household and immediately five guards start rushing in from different rooms towards you all right two of which are holding already armed and ready crossbows we'll get to that in just a second you guys okay go ahead and roll an attack he does not see you this is considered a surprise attack that hits 23 also hits yeah sneak attack right it's a surprise round don't you get double damage for being an assassin and that's all you needed he had 45 hit points (whack) with one hit to the back of his head he crumples onto the ground smacking into the wet grass around this field okay you guys right now watch as now vax runs over and tells grog to run in and go after the front door grog is running toward the door now you guys see him bolt off burst through the gate all right so go ahead and roll a strength check just for the hell of it there is a closed gate athletics this would be 14 okay it's not immediate impact it takes you a second you have to force your way through the gate you essentially grab the two sides of it and pull and pull until eventually the chain snaps and the bars bend and you shove off one of the old doors the gate (creaks impact) onto the ground before you leaving a straight look to the front door you bolt for it the rest of you guys give chase afterwards you all rush to the front door of this homestead it is currently closed all righty no there's no smoke there's no smoke there's nothing sending smoke at that point and we will pick up at this moment next week (yelling) i know i know and we'll see how this plays out next week because right now if we keep where this is going this could be-- we could be here until late and i need to get out of this costume (laughs) triceratops damn it okay well for the armor pieces the base is sintra which is one-eighth of an inch thick pvc sheeting you can buy it at sign supply stores i know liam shut up they asked me so i cut those into sheets you heat them up with a heat-gun or really hot hairdryer and you can bend it so that was the shape for these i ordered aluminum chainmail off ebay straight from india and cannibalized it to make the sheets of chainmail that i then epoxied onto the plastic and this is a pleather that i stitched together and then adhered across it to make the trim and that's how i made the armor nah you can pull them out sure i can't really grab them from here i know yeah unfortunately i don't have the lack of clipping that an actual warrior would have in this armor trust me it's a sword so great yeah and minecraft released this week story mode yeah yeah sorry that are friends of ours i mean cat taber's in it-- i know i thought i mentioned it previously but yeah you can't escape us sorry about that guys what oh right yeah the playmation toys you guys have seen the cool marvel playmation toys for kids the imaginary stuff i do iron man and loki and a few other guys yeah i'm going to go play with mine yeah anyway okay
