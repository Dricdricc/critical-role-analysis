let's see this is not-- hello everyone i don't know if it went onto twitter or not and i'm glad you guys could join i got a haircut as i'm sure some of you see it was absolutely necessary because it got way too long out of laziness and i'd like to cut it more often than i had and it'd become just a mane of ridiculousness at least here it'll have a chance to grow it's not that far from the length i had when the show first started so it's not completely out of the blue i don't think i'm also a pacer as i talk so i apologize if you keep seeing the background shift sorry about that marisha and marisha's dad are here as well and we've all been doing work around the place as we go i'll show you a little bit now been getting some work done over here say hi marisha no i haven't shown them right now we got new tile floors in here much better than the crappy grandma floors we had before say hi to mark marisha's dad there you go i thought you guys could chill for a little bit here today during international tabletop day me and liam will be up at the studio in a few hours at 930 pacific to play a game called everyone is john for those of you who aren't familiar with it it's very strange and fun and i've never played it before so i'm excited but yeah this is primarily a bunch of critmas that was left over some packages that either didn't make it in time got caught in the mail or whatever case it may be we have a bunch more letters and things here we're going to open and say thank yous we don't have the full cast here we'll be opening them for them and then making little piles for what goes to who so we can deliver them to them next time we see them hopefully this thursday possibly more minis i don't know i'm waiting on marisha to get out of the bathroom here so we can actually begin in the meantime you guys feel like you want to throw any questions here until we're ready i'm happy to do a little q&a i don't know if they're any more minis we'll find out i'm never against that idea yes haircut i know it's crazy right what the heck it's all gone only the chunks of it cool thing is it glows-- grows back it glows back that'd be a little weird people are freaking out about the hair this is kind of funny are you serious marisha accidentally turned the shower on herself no i showed them a little bit last time i can show them it's grown a little bit for those who are asking what's a good place to get minis aside from your local comic shops and game stores which have the packages if you're looking for specific ones you can go to miniaturemarketcom troll and toad ebay actually has a good mini selection or you can order the unopened boxes from amazon as well if they're in stock hero forge is new material which is a much higher quality material which is great any tips you have to get your wife into d&d show her some acquisitions inc or critical role or something and see if it's something she'd be into if she likes narrative if she likes storytelling or if she likes being random with her friends and having silly times in a fantasy world then hopefully that'll be just a little push to get on there tips on painting minis there's plenty of great youtube channels that do step-by-step tutorials on miniature painting that i highly recommend i don't know any off the top of my head but you can search painting war miniatures or fantasy miniatures there's a lot of great tutorials but as an overview you want to make sure you do a dark coat first if you want more muddled colors do a dark primer or lighter primer if you want brighter colors to come out in the final model then you just paint the model all the colors you want in different places then you do a wash which is like an ink wash pass on the model and what it does is it seeps into the nooks and crannies and giving the appearance of shadow and shading then you do dry-brushing you take a stiff brush usually small and dip lighter colors than what the base coats were fairly brighter but the same tone then you brush it on a paper towel or a small towel on the side until most of the paint is off the brush just a little bit then you dust the highest ridges of the darker color in places where it is and it gives the appearance of shine and light sourcing which is kind of fun if you go on youtube there's a lot of really great in-depth tutorials you can find there any possibility of attending a scottish con you got to get a scottish con to invite us i would love that scotland i've never been to it's where my family's background is and i would absolutely adore the chance to go to scotland so hopefully if you know any cons nearby tell them to invite us that'd be great anyway here's the mini cabinet it is growing larger and larger and organization is progressing piece by piece then of course we have thordak over there i have a problem i have a serious problem what are my thoughts on monks monks are awesome monks are amazing they're a great class that i think is underused and i think a lot of people have a hard time finding a way to fit it into a fantasy setting but i don't think it's hard at all especially if you watch conan you find that kind of -- and consider back in those time periods there was that transition between the east and the west europe silk road to china and that whole circumstance there's a lot of cultural influences you can pull from that transition and that time period that can be a fun stylistic way to incorporate your monk into a campaign or just consider the different deities and different gods of the pantheon prefer the idea of martial control and training as a means of purifying one's spirit and soul and so that makes a cool drive for a character monks are just great in combat they're fun you can do a lot of unique and interesting maneuvers and flavor them well if you love any bruce lee or jackie chan films it's great let's see will i be playing the overwatch beta i hope so i'll be playing the crap out of overwatch when it comes in i've just finally started dark souls iii last night haven't had time until then and even then it was midnight to 200 am i was like okay i'll make a character and i spent a while trying to decide what to do i made two i made lady kima and grog strongjaw i'm actually tearing through the game as grog right now which is kind of funny i figure it's a good way positive thoughts to your wife's surgery all the positive thoughts crossed hearts thumbs up crossed fingers all the good stuff if wanted to play a dwarf bard what college would i be in oh man i lend myself to the lore college because i like the expansion of spell use but for the dwarf bard i'd probably end up going valor because i like the idea of him being more aggressive and battle-oriented but that's just me dwarf versus elf i'm probably going to go dwarf elves get a lot of love in most media i think dwarves are underappreciated a lot of times and they're one of my favorite races so dwarf definitely how many times has grog died so far in dark souls three which is not bad considering i've played a lot of souls games so i know most of the tricks your bard is multiclassing into blood hunter that's amazing (laughs) oh thank you meghan it's coming along the house is coming along bit by bit do i happen to do any dm tip videos i did eight of them in the first run we're hoping to go back and do more soon scheduling has been a nightmare lately i have already ideas and outlines for future episodes but if you are chafing at the bit matt colville actually does an amazing series far more in-depth than anything i've done on tips and tricks of dungeon master-ing and building your own world i highly recommend you look him up on youtube look up matt colville dm tips and his videos are fantastic so highly recommend those ah marisha are you ready all right so we shall begin the opening i went great axe man for grog couldn't help it all right we're turning this around on marisha now hi marisha

role and thought 'this looks interesting' immediately addicted i binge watched every episode until i was caught up on the stream in one of those five live sessions i watched ashley have to say her goodbyes pike leaving was a genuinely touching moment the first of many i had an unexpectedly strong emotional impact the echoes of which led to this portrait of her this painting came unbidden unintended it began as a quick sketch on a scrap piece of board that was laying around over time it grew into clarity and became focused i thought you should have it thank you for sharing your game and friendship with the rest of us you keep me company while painting late thursday nights love you all and view you as friends even though we've never met which now that i think about it is spelled 'stalker'' that's what's great about this whole community even though we haven't met we're all friends it's pretty cool any critter who i've met in person would say the same here's to the 50th episode and to many more love mark hendrickson oh these are the sketches i think or different ideas i haven't even seen this yet i want to open it and see it what's the worst that could happen i don't know is
