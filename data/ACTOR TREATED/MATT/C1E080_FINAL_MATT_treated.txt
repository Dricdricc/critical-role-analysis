alright great that being the case - let's go ahead and dive in to the first 2017 episode of critical role hello everyone and welcome back so getting us up to speed with the current circumstance that we left off at the end of last episode vox machina the main adventurers spending the better part of this past year under the shadow of the chroma conclave a group of ancient chromatic dragons that have banded together seemingly under the banner of thordak the cinder king a great red dragon that had been sealed in the fire elemental plane for a number of years newly released and carrying with him what was called a soul anchor a magical artifact made from the heart of a fire primordial that had begun to cause him to mutate and swell and become something beyond what he was also driving him apparently insane as he dominated the countryside of tal'dorei along with the rest of the conclave you gather artifacts of great power called the vestiges of divergence under the guidance of two sphinx allies you travel between various planes and gathering these artifacts gathered allies and prepared for this climactic confrontation in your home city of emon now partially brought to ruin and flame you assembled an army you snuck beneath the city you arrived within the center of the cloudtop district nearly under the nose of thordak's defending hordes and through a climactic seeming sacrifice by your friends kashaw and zahra were allowed to pass directly into the cloudtop heading off thordak before he could emerge from his subterranean lair and lay waste to the armies as they pushed inward towards his lair ♪ there you all did battle with the great colossal thordak the cinder king a well prepared fight rolled out and while there was much danger you all persevered and managed to using the vestiges destroy the soul anchor once it was revealed within the body of the great red dragon his form rescinding and withering back to its regular seemingly withering size you-- it attempted to flee back into its lair but the rather rapid and temporarily winged rogue vax'ildan gave chase and dealt a finishing blow to the great red beast midway through its cavern towards its lair there you were joined briefly by your sister and an ally you had made through this circumstance raishan one green dragon the member of the conclave that seemingly had made a tenuous alliance with you as her goal also was to destroy thordak aiding you in the battle raishan followed suit and upon the corpse of thordak laying cut bleeding and dead in the center of this cavern she wished to take her end of the deal you had made to be left alone with the corpse for a moment to acquire some secret knowledge that apparently she was seeking from the dead dragon upon releasing the energy from the scroll which she had utilized the incantation from you decided that vengeance being your oath as a paladin and the history that you have with keyleth and keyleth's people that died under the guise of raishan's initial plotting with thordak to not let this creature stand and attacked it both you and your sister just as keyleth began to arrive the rest of the party slowly staggering behind raishan sneered and went further back into the cavern you all gave chase into this dark volcanic tunnel system which then opened up into a large red flaming cavern filled with lava pools and rivers and apparently a handful of red eggs it looked like scattered throughout this room thick dark red crimson scales with crystalline formations pouring out of the sides very similar to thordak's primordial dragon form upon finding not raishan but just this empty space you looked up to see a series of arcane summoned meteors suddenly given form rocketing from the ceiling of the cavern and slamming into the floor dealing some of you a pretty dangerous blow and sending you scattering across the floor a bit vex being thrown across the way you all managed to survive as at the end of the last battle i'd forgotten that you had made your save and you actually your bludgeon damage was halved so vex is conscious though still hurting - as the dust settles and you all take stock of what had just transpired you see the snout of the green dragon pull up into what appears to be a series of dark volcanic exhaust tunnels that seem to be like a hive network of-- of honeycomb type tunnels that just spiral off all through the ceiling and that's where we left off in the last sequence here which previously behind if i'm--if i'm correct and i believe i am and if not internet it's fine we'll--we'll do the narrative we have the three of you in the room we have percy scanlan pike and gilmore rushing up behind as fast as they can grog and kima had stayed behind to finish up one of the more recent battles and jarret is just not going in he is not in a place to follow suit you got this you got this do not worry it's okay no they did not no they would have gotten into the chamber with you only the three of you made it into the chamber they got into the tunnel but they hadn't got up to your guys the speed in which you guys all got there was basically just raishan and the three of you then the attack happened raishan rushed in you rush after her everyone else has kinda been left in the dust they're not too far behind you but things be as they may we begin tonight's episode at this next round of combat continuing where we last did so-- - so at the top of this combat round technically percy you have the initiative on this you are continuing to push through this-- this hallway you haven't quite even at a double dash you can hear explosions in the distance and then you guys watch as suddenly smoke silt and ash come flying through the tunnel from within immediately followed by the sound of these large heavy banging explosions some sort of heavy impact a series of impacts seem to have detonated deep within the tunnel and immediately set everyone in the vicinity on edge knowing that something is still transpiring in a very dangerous way deeper within this tunnel it's just the feet percy you can if you want if you really want to yeah - so anyway that ends your turn you--you run past on the side of the wall as the ash begins to settle around you as you run past kind of preparing your weapons for a coming confrontation you glance out to your right and see there the smoldering wreckage of red scales and dragon blood that was once thordak the cinder king you see that and down it's about-- you keep running you can see a gentle glimmer in the distance of a battlefield but you're not quite there yet okay the top of the round the three of you finding yourselves in this circumstance we go to the lair actions so these lair actions are-- of thordak's lair as this is not raishan's lair but even though thordak is dead the lair itself has its own natural naturally occurring dangers - so over time maybe you don't know exactly yeah it's-- it's on a recurring subscription plan so there will be-- the lava that you had just landed across so vex'ahlia as you are knocked from the explosions of the meteors from landing on your back and just barely getting back up to your feet your vision comes back as you see the stream of lava that's just barely pouring past very slowly begins to as it opens and sprays here at 20 foot radius i'm going to bring out my templates this will explode and all three of you-- i need you all three to make dexterity saving throws - okay that's fine so as it is a hotter more dangerous vicinity here the damage is higher but you all managed to make your saves so you're only taking half damage as you all avoid from the spray of magma that just bursts out and splashes in your area yes because you have your rogue evasionness and it's three ones alright - so that'll be 18 points of fire damage reduced to nine (indistinguishable dialogue) next up in the initiative order is raishan so as the splash happens you glance up and you can see what looks to be a series of maybe a dozen or so of these volcanic lava tubes that kind of are these-- these caverns roughly the size of a very low live kind of pushed in cat-like raishan you see the head and the tail kind of hanging out the side as raishan begins to mutter some sort of an incantation under her breath you hear the echo (whispering incantation) between the room as it kind of quivers for a second and her form just vanishes you did i guarantee you that's probably not the case no yes alrighty great that brings us next to keyleth's turn last you saw was up in this cavernous area roughly in this portion of the ceiling okay - so as you watch keyleth's eyes flare with this bright electric kind of blue yellow light as the ash and bit of dust that has been kind of plummeting from the ceiling from the impact of the meteor swarms and the movement of some now not seeable dragon amongst the ceiling caverns it gathers into this swirling storm that begins to build and form across the top domed portion of this cavern as it does you watch bolts of electricity arc through the storm as keyleth's form then whooshes into a burst swirl of flaming energy her physical body now becoming a swirling fire elemental you wish to move or you're gonna stay where you are sure twenty-six glancing about between the dust that's falling the movement of the storm that you've gathered at the roof of the ceiling you don't see anything that identifies the location of a dragon now so you're about right there further in good alright where's your laser pointers guys it has been i know that's okay alright so-- now is that your turn alright finishing keyleth's turn that brings us to gilmore who's rushing up past-- keeping up his pace as much as he can oh boy i know you guys take me to the nicest places and he's just jogging as best he can rushing into the ash cloud as another one pushes through some of the wind tending to push and causing swirling little dust devils of ash and cinder that's gonna end his turn vex you're up so you glance up - you see all this happening what are you gonna do okay - regular health potion okay - a greater is 4d4 plus four remember you guys are pretty low on any powerful potions at this point you used most of them so yeah there you go ten points of healing on your broom that's about as far as you can get you want to stay hovering or just like there on the ground are you going up ten feet or 20 feet or are you staying just above the ground so you're not standing on it okay okay roll a perception check sure - okay so glancing about unfortunately the gathering of the call lightning cloud combined with the other dark ash-filled interior you don't see anything that signifies the location of a dragon you do glance over and you notice that where you landed previously one of the eggs was pretty much just destroyed by this-- 'cause it was the area of the meteor swarm where you guys were hit so all gathered here so this egg right here by where you were is currently just crushed inward and filled with rock - it's hard to see it's far away but it looks like the egg has been destroyed - okay what level okay so a 3d8 technically - cause if you're casting at third level it's 3d8 plus your spell modifier alright there you go at the end of your turn-- actually she's gonna do-- okay you feel this strange sudden warm tingling sensation separate from the healing spell just in your vicinity almost like a warm breeze just kind of passes through you that's it - end of your turn - you-- yes you do this one - okay go ahead and roll for attack that hits twenty-six points of damage alright you take the blade as you rush up and then hack through it the blade only gets a few inches into the tough outer exterior of this egg and you have to push and carve through and you do carve a-- a sliver through the egg's shell and a little bit of deep brownish-maroon liquid begins to spill out of it but that's-- it's not a heavy amount of damage to the egg go ahead and roll for a secondary attack - 28 that hits i'll mark the eggs that are damaged and destroyed this one is oh that's not working too well good to know total of what - fifteen okay with that much damage the egg begins to crack even further more of the liquid begins to spill the blade pulls through and you can see as you tear a chunk of the actual shell of this egg off and it falls you have punctured some sort of thick amniotic sac that's what the fluid that's spilling out of it but you haven't seemingly touched any sort of flesh or creature within but the egg is currently has a section that is exposed over here - okay i know i'm-- i'm calculating how much movement you have ah no worries you can get right there fifteen feet in the air over this way bare with this new tech new year we're making this work so from there-- yeah you wouldn't be able to make it there destroyed this egg has one crack in the side there okay wet erase and you know it's fun yeah so i ordered way too many i put a bunch in my cart to make sure that i-- i didn't know which one to get and then forgot about it came back and was like oh shit i got to order that ended up buying like three bags full we'll have egg plastic giveaways that ends your turn vax alright at the end of your turn vax you feel the effect of the haste potion dissipate and your body all of a sudden goes from this hyperactive very familiar mode to extremely lethargic and you find yourself having to fight to catch your breath so you can't take any actions next turn -can't do anything - it's the potion it's not the boots kima is trying to keep up pace with you grog you're still in your large form how long's that last for yeah alright so you're like bounding through kima's falling behind as you guys both enter and continue past you hear the explosions in the distance and all of a sudden the rolling of smoke and ash rushes past you the smell doesn't bother you cause you've had the smell of burning beard hair most of this close to your nose what was once your great bush beard is a little tighter to your face now but are you just going full sprint to catch up with everybody - alright pike is coming with you yeah 'cause you picked her up so you're just running with pike kima's just like damn it left in the ash you while you were behind you with your full speed being faster than everybody else in this group you almost catch up entirely to percy and gilmore and pretty much on their initiative count going forward or at least of the arrival count in the next round that finishes your go let's see ♪ you were after vax right right so i got a little out of order sorry my apologies alright so anyway it wouldn't have made a difference so kima goes for a run pike is pike doing anything on your back he's carrying her that was pretty awful actually (talking over each other) wisdom wisdom five so add five to that there you go scanlan so that's a 1d-- 2d4 plus two yep you heal five hit points are you-- are you doing anything else on your turn are you dashing yes your action to move again essentially yeah you're a little bit behind and you're pretty much-- grog has caught up to you and you guys are just behind gilmore and percy at this point yeah - well he was running while you-- (breathing heavily) okay at the end of your turn-- vax you as you fly over with your wings in the air looking down at the egg you feel this sudden warm wind pass through you you don't quite-- it seems sourceless but it just seems to fill you and leave it's just different it's already a hot like you're all sweating in here so the fact that you feel something like warm briefly comparatively to the temperature around you is what catches your attention it doesn't hurt or damage you but it just seems strange okay good - percival we're up at the top of the initiative alright so alrighty percival at a full run if you go full run you'll manage to get just barely inside the cavern about there right there - so that'll be your turn there's still a bonus action if you have any use for it so go for it - twenty-five glancing around you see a fire elemental that briefly startles you as you kind of whip around in that direction but you recognize-- yeah you see eggs one is destroyed and just leaking out and like a series of boulders and what looks like some sort of a large concave impression on the top there are eggs scattered throughout the area there's a giant storm cloud gathering in the roof of the cavern and there is the large pool of lava with the small pool over there you see occasional glimmers of what look like coin in the distance sure i'll put you there sure why not percy - you're welcome i'd say it's about 60 70 feet up - yeah the whole cavern's kind of domed like this alrighty then that's percy's turn another lair action's going to transpire yeah there is a fissure that erupts over in this side of the room the ground kind of cracks open and this-- you've seen it happen once a plume of poisonous gas fills this space here let's see i need-- i need you vex to make a constitution saving throw okay good i'll keep that in mind okay it is now yeah you just-- the cloud kind of fills the area and you start coughing that's it it hasn't gone your turn yet so it is now raishan's turn legendary actions are restored it's raishan's turn deciding what to do okay um percival as you're running along the wall and you glance in the vicinity you see the cloud of poison kind of burst from the ground and you're just out of the range of it i'm sorry it's just within your range from where the-- yeah you have your mask onso as you're standing kind of amongst this-- this fume you see this within this this cloud a kind of strange burst of very very faint light in your area and you feel even in this heated room a sudden surge of heat within your kind of torso region and then it fades you now can faintly hear what sounds like there are footsteps moving through the tunnels but you're unable in the current chaos and the obscured vision to see where it's happening but there is movement happening above you throughout the cavern okay that ends raishan's turn that's gonna bring us to keyleth yep - okay you move up and as you get to the edge of it you can see now the light that your body's giving off so the fire elemental is glinting off of piles of gold and platinum that are kind of gathered around the egg about a third of it is still submerged in volcanic rock and has been placed here for quite some time you can see the crack in the exterior of the egg and the kind of thick purplish amniotic fluid that is slowly dribbling down like a-- like a slow moving molasses or sap from the wound left behind by vax go for it - fifteen to hit it does hit yes only because he pre-damaged it to that point you're basically attacking through the shell of the egg removed a portion of its armor so otherwise-- okay so you plunge your flaming fist into the fluid you hear it immediately sizzle as your fist goes into it you punch something dense on the inside (groaning) you did both of those slam attacks you rolled a 15 and a-- oh - oh oh so you rolled 15 both times - got you then how much damage did you total - eighteen from both attacks - okay cool alright so with both slams the first fist goes in and slams and hits something the second time you reach in and slamming you grab it and pull out as you kind of yank out of the egg just a little bit you see what looks like the snout of a very tiny thordak essentially but whereas the red dragon you saw thordak that was like partially volcanic crystalline with the burning eyes this creature is seemingly made from pure primordial fire and rock this is a whole new form of dragon there are five eggs that you can see currently they're all red yes you kind of killed it it's currently limp in your grasp keyleth the dragon snapper perfect you still have some movement keyleth if you want to move still towards vax this way okay what's your movement in fire elemental form - fifty feet you get about there however unaffected by fire and-- you're comfortable in this - kinda yeah -it's tingly - it's perfect alright that ends your turn gilmore just at a full run gets up to the side here and is kind of flanking he enters the space pushes up against the wall and just kind of surveys the territory he looks spooked but also kind of in that well we're here type mentality looks about the room and goes everyone all right please tell me everyone's all right (coughing) (whimpering) great that ends gilmore's turn as he just arrives grog (roars) you just come sprinting in sure - you aren't stealthy and as you run by shaun sees you about to swing and goes like fine whack might have dislocated his hip he's like (strained laugh) i'll charge you later you get about there and you are-- pike is technically on your space kind of clutching to your shoulders we'll say back here little yoda backpack you are a little bit behind everybody you've just now caught up to everybody and that's-- just your full double run and you just arrived at the edge of the map alright that'll bring us to vex's turn at the top of your turn the poison has filled your lungs and while you suffer no damage you are incapacitated you are just in a coughing fit almost falling off of your broom like sliding off to the side and just (coughing) and you just can't do anything - nope yep - the poison has completely filled you to the point where you're seizing you feel the muscles tightening up and-- it's not hurting you but you're unable to do anything vax you currently are just kinda like (gasping) taking a breath your vision kind of blurs for a moment and you can see the double vision trying to align it comes in to focus and you see keyleth's fire elemental form kind of gliding across you see the edge of your sister currently shadowed against this cloud of toxic sulfurous gas that is spewed up from the ground you can hear her coughing in the distance you see a bunch of your allies now beginning to just show up on the outside of the room's kind of lit interior and it takes you the full round to kind of catch your breath let me double check actually i'm pretty sure let me see here ♪ can't move or take actions until next turn so no alright so that ends the end of vax's turn let's see at the end of your turn there is going to be yeah we're gonna get to yours you are yes yeah your wings are just like grog you see this kind of faint glimmer of energy around you and you instinctually kind of like (grunts) (growls) but no temperature change nothing seems to happen you smell sweaty gnome on metal armor - kima's running desperately trying to catch up but she's not quite in the battlefield yet it's pike's go a 30 foot cone from where she is it's six squares she can move 25 squares right now she's been on grog's back she can kind of like leap off and-- she's right here she can move this way or this way or wherever you want this-- she'll just be on the outskirts of getting percy and can get all the rest of you guys she can just catch keyleth okay or it would possibly i'd roll again there we go that's we're looking for okay it's a natural 20 so yeah there is a burst of greenish blue arcane energy that just kind of around pike as she tries to cast the spell the spell fizzles scanlan your turn you - running up you're like just on the outskirts you get caught up right about there in the center of the room that's as far as you can get yes it would have taken you moving action to get there you have a bonus if you want to take it healing word - go for it 2d4 plus six yeah perfect let's see here that ends scanlan's turn percy you're up over here - that was the one that keyleth just punched you see no other eggs where you currently are do you want to go further on here or on this alcove here okay so you're moving across the wall you end at about there at full movement well i mean-- - yeah you could-- 26 hits sure - fourteen does not hit - sixteen does not hit okay alright so first shot it pierces through and actually cracks part of the egg you can see it's almost like a spider spiral where the egg interior cracks inward it pierces and a little bit of dark liquid begins to pool out of it that's as much as you make as the next two shots seem to ricochet off of its hard shell okay okay suddenly the entire lair begins to shake - like this tremor begins to emanate from the ceiling portion of this pieces of rock begin to fall from the ceiling i need the guys who are flying so keyleth vax and vex don't worry about this everyone else i need you to make a dexterity saving throw it's a big radius dexterity okay - five okay -pike - oh ho great dodger since i was 12 yeah percy you mange to just barely hold on without losing your the-- oh - i almost want you to just go home for that yep okay that ends the lair action it is now raishan's turn yeah - nah you watch as through the cloud of lightning that's kind of swirling a small dragon-like form just pierces through momentarily it's still see-through you can see the rest of the swirling storm around it but it's enough of that predator-like appearance where it just shapes and shimmies or shimmers through the vicinity it shimmies through as it does you watch this claw kind of lift up as this low echoing voice (whispering in foreign language) okay 30 foot cubes yeah 30 foot cube i can only get-- she can only get vex pike and grog but i need the three of you to make a constitution saving throw yes okay and pike well vex and pike both failed it's a spell dc of 22 i'm sorry you and pike both suffer 57 points of necrotic damage grog you take half as much so it'd be 28 twenty-eight points necrotic damage suddenly you feel the very air itself go gray the color is taken from your vision and your life force is drawn out of you through abi-dalzim's horrid wilting - horrid wilting the air is drawn from your lungs you feel your skin crack and tighten against your skeleton adele dazeem's horrid wilting (laughing) that's what it is now going forward oh shit well pike is not unconscious (gasps) wait did her armor get used last battle -i don't think it did - the fire giant of-- to the fort yes you are correct with how many hit points so pike is at five hit points nope nope - but vex plummets out of the poison cloud off of her broom slams into the ground and clatters spinning and falling to the ground not moving alrighty from what you know no - so that-- that is gonna end raishan's turn the form is still somewhat visible though transparent it took her full movement to even get to that point to give you a position right now ♪ it's right there though transparent it's 50 feet up fifty feet up so keyleth what are you doing yeah you can barely make out the-- the outline great go for it for call lightning no you have to roll-- no sorry a creature has to make a dexterity saving throw so what's your dc - twenty nineteen total of ten plus nine - that's 4d10 lightning damage nice you watch as the form tries to pull itself back into the cloud the cloud lights up with this crackling reddish pink electrical energy that then turns to a bright burning red as it arcs past and slams into her you watch the energy arc across the body of raishan the dragon (snarling) she does - yeah she's fine you do yes your full movement you haven't moved yet you just pulled it down in that one moment over there - okay you can go all the way over to it i mean you can make a perception check and look at it if you want to rummage through it that'll probably take your action okay okay as soon as you rush up and get a glance at it you can see that a lot of the dark purplish maroon fluid that filled most of the egg is just coating the outside of the egg's shell and there are a series of rocks and pieces of rubble from the initial meteor swam impact that has just sundered this egg it's about half the height of the others it's just all that's been kinda collapsed inward this egg is ruined nothing you can see ending keyleth's turn that brings us to gilmore gilmore watching this happen watching vex go down let's see what he does here (indistinct muttering) okay as raishan's form is up there he goes (sighs) not today not ever and releases his hand like this and you watch as a burst of strangely shifting rippling arcane energy similar to the same ripple that is shrouding raishan seems to kind of scatter up in that direction he's going to attempt to with his successful dispel magic raishan-- the form becomes completely visible now the invisibility has worn off and is now standing completely visible as this happens raishan (snarls) i will enjoy eating the flesh from your bones definitely said balls no gilmore is then going to gilmore goes from excitement to shit he's going to-- knowing the tactics that are being used he's gonna try to spread out form the rest of the group over here towards the destroyed egg across the wall that's going to end gilmore's turn this brings us to grog you can - you do yes sure you can it'll take your action to do it superior that is 8d4 plus 8 yeah - so with that your eyes come into focus vex as you feel the clatter of glass against your teeth the vial being pulled from your mouth you kind of cough for a second come into conscious as grog in his giant form cradling you like a tiny baby in his one giant mitt just kind of smiles alright don't forget you do have a point of exhaustion as you've gone-- unless you've continued your rage this whole time which you can so never mind you got that now you're just like a freak you're like drink it drink it alright great that ends grog's turn vex you are conscious prone but conscious you can i'd say your attacks would have disadvantage yep you do you did yeah do it you certainly can that was-- that was great gilmore rolled a 19 on the dispel yeah that was really good oh did you - nice look at that you and gilmore just synchronizing - misses - hits did you include your damage for it being a dragon alright so now you can see raishan emerging from one of the volcanic caves the storm's swirling around her as she begins to pull back into it you fire two arrows one gets lost the other one-- (snarling) into the side of her throat you move three squares you get onto your broom yeah one square - okay perfect - ends vex's turn vax you're up like the front half is roughly yeah you have now-- yeah you've regained your composure however your other potion has now worn off -you are no longer-- - technically yeah the bonus attack is part of your attack action so it's actually after your-- twenty-six to hit that hits ♪ fourteen points of damage okay so you go for the tongue and you get the blade up to the mouth suddenly her looking down and having a very very wide view of the entire battlefield is very advantageous from her perspective she sees you out of the corner of her eye she turns to try and snap at you and the jaws come down and catch the blade so it doesn't go for the tongue but you use that momentum to glide it up the actual tooth and jam it into the gum you manage to slam up there and the blood spurts out from the wound and-- (snarls) rears back and so now you're kind of flying up by her face now fifteen feet up yes but you're also coming at an angle which you lose distance on that you're pretty much at zero yeah that ends your turn at the end of your turn she's going to use another legendary action to do a tail attack against you she pulls part of her torso out for a moment and her tail whips out in your direction to try and slam into you that is a 19 plus what is it 32 that's gonna be 24 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to 12 so there you go alright that brings us to kima's turn kima finally arrives - seriously that's her turn so that brings us to pike actually no at the end of kima's turn let's see here raishan's gonna use another legendary action to attempt another tail attack against you since you're within range -that is a - twenty-one to hit - just hits okay seventeen points of bludgeoning damage yeah go and halve that she's used all of her legendary actions for this round okay pike - no it can-- i'd say-- let me pull it up real fast here it roars down from the heavens in all locations so it doesn't come out of the floor it comes out of the ceiling so yeah raishan currently only visible is about maybe 10 feet or so of-- actually pulling out the tail attack i'd say about 15 feet so if she's careful yeah she could probably hit raishan and not hit vax - fair enough it's gonna be close yeah roughly about 55 feet up on the ceiling with that 60 foot range she can just hit raishan with the column so yeah - so that is 8d6 damage go ahead and roll that raishan makes a save-- so a dexterity saving throw twenty-seven i'm pretty sure that saves and also makes a concentration check from your attack earlier thirty-one - so half that to 15 fifteen points of damage alright cool got it sorry so you just barely move out of the way as you watch a familiar gathering of radiant energy up in the ceiling you see the glimmer in the corner of raishan's slick eyeballs recessed within the green armor-plated face of the dragon as all of a sudden-- a great column of fire and radiant energy blasts raishan in the side of the face right there that's as far as she can get right there cool okay cool does that end your turn - good scanlan you're up that's about as far as you can go this is true roll a performance check in the midst of this chaos the rumbling of the room the sound of the lightning and thunder in the clouds the falling of rock and soot from the ceiling is drowned out by what sounds like the most beautiful clear flute it just trills (whistling) you finish the song as you watch the brass glow it begins to kinda give this-- this weird shine around it that begins to emanate this kind of additional warmth and light from it and then it dulls and the brass goes to a very tarnished dark metal material you watch the flute ping in the hallway behind him -so that's your action - okay - alrighty you roll for her she heals eight points alrighty ending scanlan's turn brings us to the top percival your turn 24 hits okay oh buddy - well i was gonna say the psychic damage doesn't negate your attacks no psychic damage doesn't affect the way-- was bad news prepared it was fine - now it is yeah so that'll hit correct alright - very nice alright so you move behind the dragon egg right there well it's the lair actions now so in this one from beneath your feet grog you feel and you look down just as the rock splits and a spray of-- a tiny geyser of molten rock just sprays outward you try and move out of the way in time but sprays across you pike scanlan and vex so i need you guys all to make dexterity saving throws whoo that'll do 21 succeeds - succeeds pike pike does not succeed succeed alright so you guys who all succeeded you take 12 points of fire damage half of you are resistant - just six pike takes 12 points of fire damage because she's resistant even though she failed her save - gets her legendary actions back given the current circumstance raishan is going to unleash she's going to unleash a full round of attacks against you as you are right up in her face and stabbed her in the gums and avoided the entirety of her meteor swarm and you also attacked her and she appreciates that but the rest of the stuff is still a problem that is 22 to hit with a bite 22 well yeah so they all hit correct so the bite attack is halved which is good that'll be 22 points of piercing damage and you got the warm tingle earlier right you also suffer ten points of poison damage he's not immune to poison - no that was the bite attack so that whole attack is halved the poison damage and the piercing you took is halved the claw attack 26 points of piercing damage and the tail bats you on the way down you guys watch as the darkened wings of vax go limp and he just plummets roll a d20 no this is a trajectory you smack right into the edge but not into the magma river you hear the cracking sound of bones breaking upon impact and the wings themselves broken feathers falling and burning within the molten rock the wings slowly fold in and curl like a spider dying and vanish and with that raishan is going to move (pieces crash) (shouts) alrighty and as she emerges now after knocking you out of the air wings fully out raishan (snarling) you're next and then swoops over and is now floating over the lava pool over that way and appears to be preparing for something yes you did fail a death saving throw from hitting the ground - yes that ends raishan's turn keyleth you're up okay make her save save 12 plus nine that is 21 which does save so takes half damage so 14 then halved okay so ten points of lightning damage okay did you want to move or you gonna stay where you are vax is approximately one foot from the edge of the river it's slightly domed in okay yes it is i will say-- i will say the touch of a fire elemental ignites whatever it touches it's kind of the essence of the element right which means he'll take half damage from any fire that you deal however being the fact that you are in control of your form you're not trying to hurt something i would say that you could carefully push him aside and i'll allow you a death saving throw as opposed to just taking straight damage i'm making a-- an advantage because of your armor yeah so you kind of roll him over you barely move him you only get him five feet from being so careful you could have moved him further but he would have-- been ignited in the process does that end your turn okay back this way back where you were okay that ends your turn - okay at the end of your turn raishan is still overhead and casts a spell - alrighty you watch as raishan over on the edge her front claws begin to form this strange geometric sigil in the middle of the air and each corner of it is a different color green orange yellow red purple blue and suddenly this giant burst-- what's the range on that she's within range - d20 add six you rolled an 18 you rolled a 12 that's an 18 total it is a hold on a second i'm pretty sure right oh i know the sigil-- as the burst of colored light begins to spray forward you watch as it just (cheering) shit i never get to use prismatic spray alright so as the spell dissipates raishan angrily alright so that ends-- that ends keyleth's turn that brings us to gilmore now gilmore over here is-- what else does he have left in the tank here he's gonna do a level four lightning bolt gilmore is going to sorry i know sorry i'm checking to make sure he can do this cause this is what he's trying to do so gilmore-- gilmore runs up and just vanishes from his place and instantly blinks up over into this area using his misty step as his bonus action and looks upward how do you like it raises his hand and pulls this way you watch as this necromantic energy begins to gather around his hands a familiar spell to you keyleth as you watch the diseased blackened veins up the side of raishan's body begin to spread and grow momentarily and kind of begin to-- to dig their way into her throat she begins to pull backward unfamiliar with this sudden internal pain rolls a natural 20 for her save but regardless that's still-- seventeen points of necrotic damage to raishan with the save that's gilmore's turn there that brings us to grog - yes yeah yes yes you can yes you may - oh shit alright yeah two additional d12's to that so roll the die first plus don't forget you double the necrotic die yeah correct 48 okay okay so as you rush up catchphrase and throw the axe sideways it arcs upward and raishan is currently kind of reeling from the dispel and angrily yelling into the room in draconic gets partway into a phrase just finishing (roaring) the axe just jams into the side of her collarbone and front torso area and the axe is still kind of wedged there are you gonna pull back so go ahead and roll your so yanking the axe dislodges itself and you catch it you see it's covered in raishan blood as you pull the axe back you watch as something just like a flash of arcane energy around her and some sort of spell uncast by her just seemingly automatically just kind of surrounds her and her flying begins to speed up yeah you have maybe 15 more feet this end sure great that puts you at the end of your turn she's gonna use legendary action at this point in her kind of sped up form she begins to (chanting) and there's a slight ripple again in the air similar to what gilmore did towards raishan early part of the battle let me see the yeah you feel a kind of a strange warmth and tingling sensation within your body scanlan it's not a save it's against an effect on you and she rolls to-- just like how you roll to overcome her spell's counter spell she gets to roll to overcome whatever effect is on you with dispel magic so that's gonna be the last of her legendary actions no it only affected the heroes' feast vex you're up yes cause you have to basically get there open it grab them and help them swallow it to have the effect take place it's a pretty involved action this way - up and towards me - this way that's about as far as you can go right there okay yeah cause you-- - alright so hunter's mark reapplied yes - alright go for it just a regular potion - oh right that is an 8d4 plus eight nice that ends your turn vex - vax you're up correct uh yeah - fails - twenty-two just hits how much damage - ten points damage diagonally away this way here - okay that's as far as you can get there okay that ends your turn that brings us to kima let's see kima rushes in with holy avenger and looks over at the distant dragon and goes oh shit who's hurting kima as an action is gonna cast a i'm gonna say third level cure wounds yeah that's 17 points of healing to pike i think kima's just gonna go at a full run (indistinct talking) right that ends kima's turn there is a flash of light in the tunnel behind you guys as a sudden burst of kind of a whitish orangish energy that briefly halos kima scanlan and pike's forms as you watch a brass talon (cheering) a brass talon that since it was used as the top of our tree i forgot to bring its base but he'll be acting there he watches as they arrive and kind of bully their way past the entrance i was wondering when you'd call actually i broke my platforms so i'll just have to use my imagination for some of this there we go j'mon they kind of stomp their way into the room stepping over you scanlan stepping past you vax nestles in kind of surveys the territory a different color than i was expecting and releases a blast of fire breath upwards in the direction-- that is a 23 okay makes the dex save so raishan pulls out of the way with a benefit from the haste spell however it does still take damage half damage from the spell that's 16d6 damage - that is 58 points fire damage half of that to 20 29 whoo pardon me i did she makes a concentration check succeeds so the haste remains viable okay that ends j'mon's turn pike is up what's the range on it yep that's the biggest radius it'd be right there in the center just under j'mon's giant brass dragon wing no up to six creatures who do you choose no that was her full movement to get there (indistinct talking) okay - there you go alrighty ending pike's turn scanlan you're up yes you should have do it what are you doing so as you begin creating your incantation and thrust your hips forward j'mon sa ord turns their head beneath the wing in your direction and arcs a brow surprised as the bolt of energy streaks forth from your groin in the direction of the dragon that is a 15 it's going to use one of raishan's legendary resistances to resist it so half damage 35 halved that's a good roll alrighty and do you wish to move or you gonna stay where you are like by pike and kima over here yeah you can move just underneath running between the legs and get about there gilmore is standing and seems to be doing alright but seen a lot struggle from the last battle and is currently about you can see a little bit of blood dried and curling from one side of the mouth hair is mussed up and looks to be a few burn marks across the skin and is kind of a little out of breath but is standing yeah gilmore's roughly half out - okay total nine great alrighty that ends your turn alright percival you're up you did yes you do yes thirty does hit yes you watch as you send the last bit of the charge through the cloak as the energy shoots up your arm into the gun and as you fire it travels with the bullet and bursts into this kind of weird reverse shock wave and the energy returns and slams for a second time into raishan's body it does not - it hits the side of the hide and ricochets off the dragon's skin we'll mark you at 25 feet up on the wall just keep that in mind okay ends percy top of this now is another lair action ♪ (indistinct talking) alright ♪ the magma over here begins to bubble and you watch as one of these strange protrusions from the rocky ground begins to bow upward and then crack open as another familiar cloud of gas begins to spill out in this area vax vex scanlan i need you guys to make constitution saving throws j'mon - does make it yes okay you do make it - eighteen yes the two of you manage to succeed pike as well okay so this cloud is still kind of permeating this area obscuring it slightly ending that now it is raishan's-- you rolled a four - so when your turn comes around next - no you'll just be coughing and incapacitated the coughing fit that this poison gas creates is so bad that you can't do anything but hack yes now being raishan's turn still hasted pardon me raishan is going to dart backward and snatch up this one egg with her claws grabs it and kind of carries it up underneath so that's 20 to get there and back to grab that she kinda swoops down grabs it moves forward ever so slightly this way and no from back here is going to release a giant burst of poisonous gas outward affecting-- kima shrugs it off pike shrugs it off grog you shrug it off cause you resist the dispel that didn't work earlier gilmore ate the feast earlier and is also unaffected however i need that's right cause you can only have so many people eat from it alright i need gilmore vax vex and scanlan to all make constitution saving throws yes - pike didn't get dispelled so pike is immune you got a 9 - yes - not you percy vex - okay you guys and scanlan all suffer 83 points of poison damage eighty-three - gilmore thanks to your heal earlier gilmore is still standing with two hit points - brass dragon but it is here in a minute rolls a one on its saving throw gonna use legendary resistance to make the save so he only takes-- they only take-- 41 points of damage there okay so as this billows forth so vax he falls unconscious vex you fall unconscious fall off the broom hit the ground taking four points of bludgeoning damage you suffer a death saving throw from the impact 10 foot drop on your head it's only a-- - it's only a d6 bludgeoning damage but when you're unconscious while falling you now realize the downside of flying all the time as the poisonous breath billows out and everyone's coughing and falling over you watch the twins fall unconscious raishan kind of grins you've got a few surprises i see but you're not the only ones and then is going to use the rest of her movement to whip over here she's carrying two eggs underneath she still has 40 feet of movement and is going to turn back and flies there no she grabbed the two eggs and is positioning alright that ends raishan's turn keyleth you're up which way - over here over here - i'd say roughly 30 feet 35 feet there you go twins you're about 30 another 35 feet from them okay well with both twins you'd have to move there you drop your form - alright i'll put you there - sure raishan saves the eggs cannot save technically so go ahead and roll damage yes she did the eggs did not thirty-eight okay that would be 29 no sorry no from 30 19 nineteen damage to raishan and the two eggs-- you watch as the bolt hits arcs through her arcs through the eggs you see the eggs still carrying them no visual well nothing you can see no okay at the end of your turn watching you form over hit her with lightning hit the eggs and all of a sudden breath come back to the lungs of vax on the ground raishan not so fast still clutching the eggs her front claws kind of form this small spiral as the air grows surprisingly cold causing this mist to form around the extended ends of her claws as she puts her arms forth casting cone of cold outward from her that's going to be i don't know if it's going to hit does not hit gilmore however i need scanlan oh you can't technically move cause you're doubled over yeah - what's the range on that unfortunately gilmore's just out of range 60 foot range good looking out though so that is kima pike j'mon scanlan vax and vex all making constitution saving throws so you take another death save - and even then even at half damage she's unconscious so you're at two death saves on impact you're unconscious again to zero -you take - an eleven yeah so you take 43 points of cold damage unconscious - both roll for pike roll for pike if you could please pike takes another 43 points of cold damage alrighty so that's the end of keyleth's turn it's now gilmore's turn gilmore does not cure unfortunately that's not his specialty he's used a lot of his spells (sighs) yes gilmore rushes around j'mon almost as a defensive stand point but also kind of taking in the circumstance watching this blast of cold air come through kind of looks around seeing everyone on the ground it's like oh god oh god and in a fit of rage and needing to lock this down just gonna go ahead with what he has left at his disposal to release a all he can really do is a lightning bolt which raishan rolls a one uses legendary resistance to resist it i know ten points of lightning damage to raishan go pee it's fine do my best grog - actually no oh thank you so much thank you thank you thank you beautiful they found my base look at that looks much more majestic when it's up in the air oh god i'm juggling here stay on there alright so at the end of that turn there's two more legendary actions from raishan she has four she has four to cast a melf's acid arrow at gilmore ♪ he's underneath okay a ranged spell attack so yeah that hits so that is 4d4 acid damage against-- that's five five ten points of acid damage gilmore is now also down as gilmore runs past the dragon raishan just with this almost underhanded flips her claws out and this one little greenish dart of arcane energy slams into gilmore's chest and he just falls to the ground burning into him like alien blood grog it's your turn - yes wait for which one on the-- if you're enlarged no it doesn't increase your speed at all you're still 50 you're bigger-- you could get that far there okay alrighty so you're gonna use your action to administer the greater healing potion to pike alrighty go for it - yeah 4d4 plus four fifteen points to pike that ends your turn grog - what'd you roll - five there on the banks of the lava flow in thordak's lair the breath escapes vex her body going still and unfortunately not cold because of the vicinity of the flames but vex has fallen - vax - with advantage - made it that brings us to kima ♪ kima who's-- pike is now conscious correct from the potion kima's panicking watching all this happen and seeing this happen in the distance looks to gilmore looks to vax she kind of frustratingly just throws the sword at her side and reaches down and does a level two healing word to gilmore that is 12 so gilmore is back and conscious alrighty that ends kima's turn is now-- that was-- that was not healing word sorry cure wounds she's going to move stepping over his body keep it going friend leaps over him two three four five and she kind of runs past pulling the sword out again looks up at the dragon and says alright show us what you can do buddy there's a lot riding on this after kima is j'mon they look down at the running halfling dire as it may be that's why we're here let's see if he gets his breath back nope they did not get their breath back rushes up and-- goes right up into raishan's space so just rushes up into raishan you feel the wind kind of blast past as the wings of j'mon sa ord devo'ssa pick them up and they rush around strafing the side of raishan and unleash a barrage of attacks against her that will be-- first one is 16 no bite misses three and a two really three two and one that is ridiculous so - as j'mon rushes up and unleashes raishan who is slippery at best and really really really creepily deceitful at her worst dodges to the side so she's in the shadows and the cloud of the storm in the air to kind of hide her form as j'mon reaches out and starts slashing raishan who's now has this kind of wild look in her eyes of now mounting victory from a moment of fear earlier she manages to avoid the first two strikes and the third one the tail slaps against the side of raishan's body whack and smacks to no effect that ends j'mon's turn it is now pike's turn pike is about 25 feet away revivify is touch and she's coming up from unconscious prone which means she doesn't have the movement to get there to touch her oh no she was-- she was-- oh oh so she was prone she was prone no so she can move she can't get there it's a touch spell had she used them recently the internet will let us know right right so the sprinter's boots will let her double her movement for a round alright - now this is mid-combat -for the purposes of this-- - i understand so this-- this is going to be a rapid resurrection skill check so but this is only from pike because it is a singular roll so as pike rushes up what does pike utilize to implore vex's soul to return go ahead and just roll a d20 a ten as the glow from the outside of her form that just radiates with the armor itself centrally focuses itself into her holy symbol and is sent down the arm each piece of the plate mail glowing in succession like a series of chained lights as it reaches the fingers touching the bottom of her fingertips to vex's torso the air seems to go dark for a moment around her body before it pulses and with that you watch as her jaw moves ever so slightly taking in once more the warm air of thordak's lair pike want to do anything else bonus action okay so that is a 4d4 plus four yeah you guys have been hording potions for a while you've been burning through all of them from these two encounters okay nice alright at the end of pike's turn devo'ssa j'mon sa ord is gonna use two legendary actions to attempt a wing attack he is now like just assailing raishan with their wings so raishan has to make a dexterity saving throw that is cocked try again no that is a failure raishan's gonna use the last legendary resistance to resist that so instead takes that's seven points of bludgeoning damage and is not knocked prone that would have messed her up okay no she is not she's safe okay that brings us to scanlan that's a death saving throw off scanlan alrighty that brings us to the top of the round percy you are in the back of a wall the curse of the unscathed okay go for it really - so you're pulling out retort that hits two more attacks on that right that's-- well bad news takes an attack to reload right but usually it's action that hits okay that hits nice - let me take some concentration checks on that yep and yeah around this way so you get about there okay that ends your turn it is now back to a lair action - the ground in the center here quakes and cracks open as a familiar burst of magma-- -everyone in this vicinity - i need vex vax you're-- right but you're still unconscious right so you just take-- you just lose a death saving throw as the magma bursts and sprays around so you take one i need you to make a dexterity save -i need scanlan-- - you lose another - i need pike to make a dexterity saving throw and you too grog gilmore does not make it i'm rolling shit for damage that's good wow okay so-- okay ten points of fire damage to each of you halved so you both take five okay a 19 okay you succeed so you take half damage so you take five but you're resistant from the potion so half that so two two points of fire damage alrighty it is now raishan's turn hasted raishan by the way from the attack from percy the damage you can see raishan is now visibly bleeding parts of the scales are torn you can see now at a close up vantage point as much as the previous dragons you've battled have had a lot of resilience raishan's taken a fair amount of damage but seems to not be quite as physically hearty as what you previously faced and is looking visibly hurt raishan is going to begin the round turning to the rest of you i have business elsewhere and you're being really obnoxious stay down and glancing over is going to go ahead and with both of her hands again release another she is almost out of spells cone of cold that is-- i need-- -so scanlan-- - scanlan is - frozen covered in ice locked in place a solid gnome bereft of life motionless on the ground gilmore takes-- gilmore loses a death saving throw vax you take another damage to your two failed death saving throws pike needs to make a constitution saving throw grog constitution saving throw you were so you also-- twenty-four you succeed okay that's 30 points of cold damage to pike - yeah pike is unconscious so pike is down - watching this carnage you watch as the spell finalizes the blast of cold arcane energy just careening forth and then fading the ground itself which is now normally glowing orange is now covered with a very thin sheet of ice and you watch steam rise up from the contrasting heat and cold from the spell effecting the surrounding atmosphere as the mist dissipates you see a big toothy grin curl across raishan's face little bit of dragon blood curling past her teeth from the wounds that she's suffered glaring nervously over at j'mon sa ord who has taken nearly no damage at this point and is currently up in raishan's face raishan says well i'm afraid i have to get to the rest of my day die amongst your friends as you should and just tears off of j'mon and goes into a full hasted fly away - j'mon does j'mon is gonna make a bite attack against raishan with a natural 20 - it does not grapple but that is she will yeah that is 18 plus eight that's 26 piercing damage plus she's immune to poison she takes no poison damage that's 28 points of piercing damage to her concentration check oh she's fine it's ten plus 14 so yeah she's fine so the haste does not dispel however j'mon bites out and takes a huge chunk of flesh as the teeth just scrape across the back of raishan's wing and shoulder like (snarls) but manages to pull away and at a full 160 foot flying speed hasted and just disappears down the hallway into the ashes and shadow behind keyleth it's your turn a 160 feet yeah ♪ no she is outside of your dark vision view radius and there is no light in the tunnel ahead and it is a slight incline you just watch her just disappear into the dark tunnel currently have no bead of sight on her a 120 foot range the spell from where you are currently which is over here she went 160 feet even further away from you than she was so she'd be beyond the distance of the spell unfortunately i mean you have to still jump so you have to make an athletics check it's about six seven feet so make an athletics check well not a new rule the actual rule so as you rush over trying to help you go to leap but your foot catches what you thought was solid volcanic rock unfortunately it's brittle and broken and it slips beneath your foot in doing so you only get about three feet before you plant the lower half of your body straight into the lava that's 53 points of fire damage - you're essentially prone in the lava you rolled a one to jump and you basically went - you're technically prone the rest of your movement will get you up and out but it'll just get you out of the lava - so you'll get out and you'll be just on the edge there wow wow wow this whole thing's a metaphor for 2017 okay what level vax is now conscious there you go - so gilmore gets up kind of looks around where did she go okay he rushes this way and as he gets about there he slams into something that is currently invisible you see a slight ripple of arcane energy and you see a series of small glyphs spiral outward and then it goes see-through again he starts slamming his fists on it of course of course of course he goes and let's see what he has left yeah technically he looks like a mime from your standpoint i haven't the faintest i only just arrived so we're gonna continue going through the order here so grog it's your turn okay - 4d4 plus four alright that ends your turn grog you do - two of them are completely destroyed and there is one that has been shot and is leaking okay that brings us to vex i need you to make a death saving throw towards this egg - okay ♪ that's two death saving throws on vex - vax so yeah cause you've been giving it out-- i'm pretty sure you used it once before go for it - you're still prone by the way you just basically crawled over and touched her - okay so you stand up and you still have half your movement if you wanted to pike is conscious your sister's conscious - which one - alrighty that ends vax's turn kima rushes up and swinging her holy sword in the air goes for a full swing noticing that everybody's now conscious goes and takes a full swing towards this invisible barrier as it streaks across you see divine energy go flying off in a shower of sparks and a giant shimmering shaking visual on this-- this force wall that stands here in the center of the hallway as she finishes her attack it shimmers unscathed she goes for a secondary attack strikes again this time as it strikes across the sparks are even brighter and you can see the impact almost pushing her back off of her feet and as the blade comes to the end of its second arc she looks up the wall still stands alrighty that brings us to - the phone's out oh god come on four percent i got four percent left i know - yeah j'mon with each strike is like testing the boundaries of it across the sides of the tunnel and just goes this magic holds fun charger i'm not getting a charge that's alright it happens anyway j'mon oh j'mon gets the breath weapon back and kind of pushes both kima and gilmore aside excuse me and unleashes a blast of burning hot breath across this wall as it hits it just curls across and spreads across the side of the walls as the dragon shields both kima and gilmore from the blast as it finishes the flame has been split the entirety and has no effect on the wall pike well she was-- she was prone right she just came back to consciousness so she gets up for half her movement being a gnome it's one of those things where 25 feet halved and you always round on the lower end of the scale at ten feet she's not close enough to touch scanlan yet sprinter's boots already got used it's got one round use alright then i'll trust her good alright then then that will be just enough to put her up next to scanlan okay go ahead and roll a d20 thirteen okay as she implores to the spirit of scanlan in this frozen form you watch as the icy crystals that have coalesced around his form and locked him in his place his face kind of-- this frozen look of horror the ice begins to turn into mist around him and his color begins to return to his skin his expression relaxes as his eyes suddenly focus and scanlan you find yourself conscious again looking up at pike tears in her eyes pulling her hand back from your shoulder looking up into the dark you know glowing lit interior of thordak's lair there we go cool that's what i wanted thank you so make sure everyone has their equipment cards on them alright so that finishes pike's turn scanlan you're conscious now well right now as we're getting back into this percy what are you doing first things first mordenkainen's magnificent mansion is a one minute casting time so you could do it but in the process of doing so you'd probably go through about 10 different lair actions in here so keyleth you're using you said stone-- it would be very tiny and you'd have to crawl through to create enough-- cause you're not quite sure how thick the barrier is so you have to be-- have to roll an investigation check and based on your roll i'll let you know eight you're not sure you can give it a shot before it gets to you it does come back to a lair action okay so take your healing sorry i asked you what you were doing what do you want to try okay well you have to-- stay on the wall okay leaving you roughly there so even a full turn that's as far as you could get on a double run cool alright now-- now this happens with this the quakiness of the lair seems to be subsiding a little bit there is a tremor on the ground it only effects those directly around the barrier so that's my people everyone succeeds so no one falls prone so no effect on that lair action per se alright past that you can see in the distance past the wall dark in the tunnel which is almost pitch black beyond the radius you see this slight purplish glow and then a flash of purple energy it's a touch spell so you have to get up to it so you're back there so you just get up to the edge of the doorway and the wall with a double run - okay yeah okay go for it so it is 4d4 plus four alright gilmore gilmore doesn't really have anything that can be of aid right now grog you're up about the same size as raishan raishan and j'mon have a very similar physicality like their bodies can much like a cat can get really thin just enough to fit through the tunnels maybe but not with any riders you guys would probably be squeezed off or crushed in the process go for it go for it that'll hit - okay so the first strike just cleaves through the egg entirely - i know you impact at the point of the bullet that percy left earlier which kind of left that spider web crack in the front and that just causes the entire thing to buckle under the sheer force of your axe as it swings the egg gets cut in half tumbles over splattering primordial dragon whelp gore and you can see the remnants inside of what is now a two-parter primordial dragon whelp yeah as it flew off and kind-- sure as you pull it up and this creature is nearly identical to the one that you pulled out earlier it's still deep red crimson but like fully fully primordial in its visual you take back a chunk of it and you throw it at the wall and it just passes through (gasps) it smells terrible currently you destroyed three of them and two were lightning baked and taken off by raishan well that finishes grog's turn vex i'm pretty sure you guys went down guns blazing okay - 3d8 plus whatever your modifier is go for it twenty points okay - with your speed and getting up cause you were prone that close right there you can't quite get to the dragon guts that's as far as you can get alright so that ends vex's turn vax whatcha doing you walk right through forward now and all of you just start like crawling over all of you okay - kima goes wait what as soon as you grab the shoulder and you both suddenly vanish and reappear at thordak's body you both land with a flash of arcane light as your feet hit the ground it is an empty tunnel so no raishan -there is no thordak corpse - correct - as you guys approach gilmore steps up and goes i think i have a pretty good idea what that flash we saw was - getting the hell out of here son of a bitch he takes a rock and throws it hair's kind of tussled no - and that's where we'll end tonight's episode (all groaning) we have a flight early in the morning i can't believe you all lived well if-- if you had fallen into the lava by the way if you had rolled poorly you would have been submerged in lava which was well that-- that's 18d10 points of damage if that had exceeded your max hit points you would have been instantly dead and turned to ash yeah there were a few close calls there oh yeah the prismatic spray that would have been real bad it's a cone that big just so you guys know cause it's a fun spell to kind of talk about and each of you would have been hit with a different colored ray i would have rolled a d8 to see what color had hit you on a one you take 10d6 fire damage on a failed save half an orange take 10d6 acid damage save for half yellow 10d6 lightning damage so just randomly all of you guys basically just take 10d6 of something green you take 10d6 poison damage half save five 10d6 cold damage six on a failed save you're restrained and you have to keep making saves or you turn to stone seven you're blinded and you have to keep saving a successful save ends it if you fail the next save you will be transported to another plane on an eight on an eight i roll again for two rays against that person - keep rolling eights you're gonna be fucked it's a fun one i like that spell it's one d8 so ten would be instant death it would be if i roll a 10 on a d8 sure you are so done oops so guys we'll pick this up again next week on thursday find out where raishan is with two eggs and the corpse of thordak the cinder king you start with a disadvantage alright guys you guys we'll see you at magfest this weekend we'll see you there shortly she came pretty close three two and a one that really sucked i wasn't getting-- cause that the fire breath is nasty but anyway - happy new year well done guys you survived -
