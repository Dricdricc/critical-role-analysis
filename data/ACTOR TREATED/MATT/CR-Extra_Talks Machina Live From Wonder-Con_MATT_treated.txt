that's a lot of people hi i'll jump in here and say that an internet space that can be a very volatile and opinionated place for people who are passionate i'm perpetually and continually proud that this community has been so open so accepting and so supportive of each other that it's kind of allowed critical role to become so much more than just a show the community itself has become really the driving and most important and magical thing about it to me so that's you guys we're talking about you so is travis boy or girl yeah oh man that's a good question as far as like challenges of both ways when you have a show especially when it's something that you do privately that's put on display there's a difficulty of one waiting for an audience to set it on fire and watch the thing you love be burned to the ground thankfully that didn't happen not yet but i think at least between the two what makes shows like this and other tabletop shows and kind of what internet media is pushing for now is people that are open about their passion and are creating it for themselves as well as the audience and not just as content to be consumed it's an invitation to be part of it as opposed to hope you like this thing i made as long as we maintain that i think we're doing okay that is one of the weirdest things having this little phrase that organically started in our game rooms at home not just on merch but other people in thousands of games use it now i'm like it's exciting i would never have thought that i know i'm sorry this was not expected you too thanks keyleth don't even talk about pre-show jitters to me guys i'm a madman for an hour before every cast you guys see me i don't even talk to them they come by like hey matt i'm like go away i'm setting things up i was like okay cool that's happening give me more of that water travis yeah that's a great little dodge and weave every week now i don't recommend it unless-- be really good friends with your dm before you do that please that's when the boulder appears and crushes your character so be careful but that's also part of therapy but no to try and tie it back to the question-- well no i mean tabletop gaming there's been a lot of studies that speak on the therapeutic benefits of the ability to create a persona that is outside of yourself live in those shoes and build empathy through that experience i know i owe a lot of who i am today to playing tabletop gaming not only this experience forged our friendships to be as strong as they are but it's now gone out and forged all these friendships through this community and beyond you know there are people i used to game with that i still keep in contact to this day from a long time ago so it's a weird shared bond like going through a very intense experience together with people except it's all up here because we're crazy in my eyebrows everyone has to go into my eyebrows for the adventure that's what wildemount is translated to in dwarvish let it happen by people you mean travis i will say you guys have gotten better recently i mean moderately incrementally there has been more planning there has been more seeing alternate options before making a choice this happened in a recent episode so you guys are stepping baby steps in a good direction travis is already out all right next question well for those who aren't familiar with the difference between devils and demons in a nutshell demons are an ancient chaotic force of destruction and mayhem devils are very organized tyrannical structure of chaos and mayhem recent adventures bring them to a very dangerous place with a lot of large-scale dangers than they're used to they're used to single-target localized enemies they've stepped into a territory where everything around you for forever is bad it's been fun to watch them squirm i'm not going to lie as far as contracts go that's the bread and butter of the devils' work that's how they gain their influence and power i was very eager to see what the reaction was when such a contract was presented so without spoiling anything i am very proud of my group from a dm standpoint not for you guys i absolutely love anything you do that is a poor choice it fills me with such joy and inspiration but to be fair in the nine hells there is no real great choice everything is going to probably end up poorly so good luck i mean it's not that black and white if you did something good people would be like why'd you do that depending on who it was we'll find out huh i didn't think so you know what incubi and succubi are guys grog'll maybe find out tune in next week what could possibly go wrong where do they line up i mean technically it was written but it had a lot of impact i think by a good writer when patrick rothfuss wrote the letter to keyleth the you passed through fire i think was such a wonderful encapsulation of her character arc at that time yeah he should do a book at least a third one sorry pat i will always have multiple personality disorder there we go thank you wizard is actually artificer-adjacent so yeah you're a busy man making duck tales and shit it's fine you are awesome and i aspire to be you yeah dice and books before and you know what i feel guilty if they don't work and if they work i'm happy to take credit but thank you as far as advice goes my first point of advice would be watch matt colville's youtube channel there's a lot i would like to say but i don't have the time to get into the nitty-gritty and he has such an incredible way of communicating very elaborate detailed and informative conversations and discussions on this topic if you haven't seen his work check out his videos they're incredible he's a dear friend and an amazing writer so check it out as far as blessing your book i can bless it from here and if you can hunt me down at some point today we couldn't get a spot to do a signing at this convention unfortunately wondercon was a little slammed but i will send my juju from here it's due to the scaling of the entities that they're working with and the situation involved a dc can be set based on how difficult the challenge is you know if a person's like i'm trying to stealth in a shadowy alleyway that's going to be a pretty low dc but if i'm going to try and stealth while standing on top of this lighthouse in broad daylight it'll probably have a higher dc to roll a proper stealth check he could probably pull it off so yeah i adjust the dc if a person's trying to convince somebody and they make a really convincing argument i'll lower the dc for a persuasion roll if they really bungle it up then i'll raise it a little higher so yeah it'll adjust depending a lot of creatures that work in the place where they currently are you know the hells they thrive on deception and being paranoid especially in dis dispater the archdevil of where they are right now is a very paranoid son of a bitch that nature of always looking to see if your underlings are trying to undermine you means that if you're trying to lie they're going to definitely have a high sense for that and be looking for that as well so yeah to answer your question yes thank you i'm going to call this to the art community can somebody please do an art piece of vox machina sitting in the city of dis saying communally this is fine please sam roll higher no not at all i will say now that lin manuel has gotten himself a little warmed up i think it's time for him to take another crack at a different d&d game no seriously lin please come play with us i had a lot of time alone as a kid i make notes i have general notes next to certain npcs of their vocal texture their age different things to get me cliffs notes i try and ballpark it whenever they show up or i make something up i mean if there is a celebrity i can attribute it to i'll put that down like an alan rickman type or an orson welles type usually it's like you know gravelly low basically what you'd see in any voice-over side where it's super vague but just enough to get an idea kind of yeah like most of my notes it's all sanskrit at this point it's only for me to read oh man i mean some of my favorite experiences as a dm involve having an opportunity to share what little knowledge i have with people and learn things from other dms you know as a community d&d for a long time was whatever you could learn from your local comic shop and maybe a forum board in the mid-2000s when that became more of a thing so now there's this breadth of information out there from all these different schools of running a game for me it's been really cool to learn from other people and try and impart what i do know that's hopefully helpful to other people that's been a big thing as far as actually playing a game with these guys i'd say probably the attack on emon having a two-and-a-half-year-long plot hook that's been brewing and brewing and get them into this place of comfort and finality and then smash it all to pieces and watch their faces as everything they know crumples around them that was pretty fun what about you guys anyone else as one cumulative guest they switch out roleplaying the character and since we already got vin diesel the next step obviously is madame judi dench i think she'd have fun since he did teach her how to play yeah hello audience story-wise no i mean some of the character abilities changed based on the system but not a whole lot thankfully i'll tell you scanlan became a lot more helpful yeah and then i had to completely create the 5th-edition transition for your gunslinger but other than that thank you very much there has to be you know ebb and flow there has to be some encounters that are relatively not as challenging so you can really enjoy the power that you've acquired as a character then there have to be challenges along the way to make you feel like it's a terrible difficult circumstance yeah hi i have a love for gothic horror i'm sorry i dream of trees there was a reason because it was funny and travis agrees it's practicing and rehearsing and learning techniques for the show guys that's totally it no to be fair for a good ten years since they first announced it and i couldn't afford it i've always looked at a distance from the colossal red dragon mini the colossal mini just could never get it when you guys as a community sent two of them it was like a long-time christmas coming that finally arrived those are centerpieces that i'm still proud of to this day then somebody sent me a painted tarrasque that's just waiting for the day that it gets to be unleashed that's pretty fun too that's going to be good so yeah definitely probably those two thank you do it that'd be awesome that'd be a lot of fun would you guys like to see that (cheering) oh my god that'd be so funny to see everything from his perspective good suggestion favorite magical item the alchemical jug the grog dimension my answer real fast to that because i feel it needs a mention is craven edge just because the grog interactions were so much fun i guess we'll have to find out i mean it depends on whether or not the first person the deal was made with still exists and if it does-- and there is actually a place in the hells for people that are contesting contracts there is a pit fiend baatezu who is there as the judge that is part of the process of you trying to appeal your contract when your soul arrives usually goes poorly anyway but there are a few that get off it's kind of fun i guess we'll see if you take the other pacts or break this one
