turn if you'd like that's entirely up to you and they're off as a note because i forgot guys for subs tonight every hundred subscribers we get one person in the chat will be chosen to win a signed cast picture and a signed poster of one of our artists kit buss's wonderful art pieces for critical role signed by us as well so we got some cool giveaways forgot that at the top anyway 20 and up all right ten to 15 13 all right keyleth what do you have six okay all right as the skittering seems to go to a fervored frenzy you can see masses and masses of extremely matted fur moving and quivering through this refuse as a series of rat swarms pour out of the edges of this giant dung pile and where at the center that giant entity has revealed itself to be a terrifying visage of some kind i'm going to have you go ahead and roll an arcana check 22 immediately as soon as this creature comes out (squelch) this horrible guttural bubbling sound its throat makes as it pulls itself out of this nasty collection of refuse you've read of this in quite a few tomes before in your travels this is known as an otyugh an otyugh usually riddled with disease they're controlled garbage disposals for those that can keep control of them and it is kashaw's turn you currently have no idea about 15 feet up you can see the opening of the tunnel where you guys slipped out and you have no visual sight of the rest of your party-- which you guys were left in darkness by the way you can see you have dim light so you're fine well he still has his light spell you can see this creature now (growls) it depends on the spell's radius if it's relatively small then probably not they're not even within visual range so you'd really have to try hard to hit them at this point you guys are all about ten feet away from this giant creature right now sacred flame (laughs) kash money all right so go ahead and look at the spell what's it require from you okay so the target makes a dexterity saving throw let's see if it makes this what is your spell dc should be at the top of your spell list 16 okay it does not make it as you bring out your holy symbol for a moment from beneath your armor you look forward and thrust your spear forward this energy travels from the middle of your torso across your arm down the spear and fires off as this burst of vibrant whitish-blue light that blasts into the front of this otyugh creature you deal 3d8 damage to it so go ahead and roll eight-sided dice three times eight and five and four 17 damage (impact growling) you can see now it has the two giant tentacles with these jagged spines that look covered in whatever it's been climbing in and this one central stalk that has eyes across it and the eyes flicker in pain and wince and then focus in on you and looks across your companions do you wish to move or do you want to stay where you are okay so you can try and move closer this way probably you're now adjacent to one of the rat swarms but you're pulling it away from the entrance here it looks like normal-sized rats not that you would know because you're not in the room but there's clusters and clusters of these rats swarming over each other no it's just the singular target but if you have things that hit larger areas they can hit multiple guys that ends your turn next up is tiberius you can yes next to him okay you will get free strikes from both the rat swarms currently because you'll be passing through there and out of their melee range you cool with that you can this guy will still get an attack of opportunity on you you can use an action to disengage over here show me with your laser pointer where you want the impact to be okay i'd say that'd probably be right around this area here okay wait up let's do the fireball first one thing at a time so as you use your ring you focus the ray streaks past slams into the wall behind (explosion sound) with a deafening roar and you guys definitely hear this the hallway in the distance suddenly brightens up and you can see a bit of flame roll up and the scent of smoke comes wafting past you as a wave of heat blasts through the tunnel what's the dc on your spells does not make the save so full damage on the otyugh that rat swarm would also be hit what's the damage on the fireball (singing) math wizard math we're going to pimp out a calculator for him one day 48 points of damage boom all right well after the fireball explosion settles you can see there's a big char mark in the front of it some of its teeth have been blown into the inside of its mouth the rat swarm behind keyleth is completely incinerated with a hundred-squeak screeches and you can smell charred fur and hair and flesh in the air well no you have to make a ranged spell attack for each one there is no saving throw for it yep so roll for each ray okay they all hit (laughter) it was there and he was right 6d6 fire damage 29 all righty as each ray (impact sounds) you can see the flashing of the flaming light in the air this darkened room is suddenly illuminated in bursts as each of these rays of burning fire go blasting into the side of the otyugh it's nearly pushed back into the pile that it pulled itself from but steadies itself does that end your turn all right tiberius's turn has come to an end all right next up is the otyugh who is extremely unhappy with how that went down (growls) you now see as it pulls from the front of its body one giant backwards-looking elephant leg that steps into the front of the material a second one forward it pulls itself completely out of the pile and you can see a third one like a giant tripod these thick legs carry it forward it is going to do a bite attack and a tentacle attack on you and a tentacle attack on keyleth as you're the nearest to it so as it rears back with its mouth this giant maw opens with all these nasty jagged broken teeth and the smell that comes out of its mouth is horrifying even for your experience as a dragonborn that would be 18 to hit why would i have disadvantage oh good call oh that's even higher 19 but thank you for the reminder that's good to know so it hits so as you're hanging back and your image is shifting and shimmering nearby its mouth is just too big and as it bites down while it would have partially hit the side it manages to find your proper location the teeth clomp down onto you you take 16 points of piercing damage as you (grunts) reach back in pain you push yourself out of its mouth i need you to make a constitution saving throw 22 okay so you pull off and away you can see where it dragged across your scales it left this nasty trail of black-- whatever you would call it saliva-- but you manage to slip it off your hand and you feel like it's probably not going to bother you too much however as you steady yourself one of the tentacles comes swinging down towards you that is also with disadvantage that would be a 21 to hit all right you take seven points of bludgeoning damage from the impact that's only four points of piercing damage as the spines slam into your side and seem to stick onto you you are also considered grappled and restrained for the time as the tentacle wraps around you and the spines are digging into your body it now has you by your waist and is holding you in place that'd be a total of 11 damage plus the bite no did you not write down the bite damage i told you half of that stoneskin is still up that is correct how long does that last hour yeah that should've lasted long enough you're fine yeah so half of that would've been-- yeah 13 points of damage that was a lot of technicality in one turn well done tiberius all right that will be a 23 against you that turn's done that'll be a total of 14 points of bludgeoning damage to you and five points of piercing damage and you are also grappled by the other tentacles here you are both currently being held to the sides of the creature correct that brings us to vax about 15 feet up and you're that far back (counting) yeah pretty close right there that's your turn bonus action if you want it yeah whatever you're trying to hit might have three-quarters cover okay that ends your turn now the swarms moving in each one of these rats swarms start crawling up towards your body and they're starting to find their way into your armor and they're biting it's a terrible experience swarm attacking keyleth is going to be a 16 to hit nope you brush them off yourself (laughs) the rat whisperer attacking you brother kash that looks like it's going to be a ten to hit what's your armor class 20 these rats come forward and you (whack) knock them out of the way with your shield against tiberius that is going to be with disadvantage-- you're grappled but you're not floating in the air not yet that's going to be a 13 so it's going to miss you so the rats no effect yet that ends their turn keyleth you're up all right what level is blight blight is 4th all right constitution saving throw that is an 11 what's your dc i'm pretty sure it fails okay it takes 8d8 necrotic damage go ahead and roll damage 36 damage nice as you grab the tentacle you can see the slippery slimy flesh and it has the residue on it as your fingers grasp into it its brownish-yellow color all of a sudden turns into this grayish sickly dried landscape as you can see the flesh cracking to dust around it the tentacle's still grasping onto you the magical energy travels up the side of what would be its torso and body and you can see it beginning to withdraw through severe pain it manages to eventually shrug off any further spread of the magical disease of the blight but it has left this horrible scarring across one side of its whole body you can't really move this turn since you're currently restrained yep all right that brings us to thorbir what you got that's a full round of movement there all right that ends that that's going to bring us to the top kashaw your turn no it's still functional still wrapped around her there's scarring across it and a large part of its upper torso torso it's weird to say parts of its body when it has that strange construction (laughs) i apologize okay that'll get you there that one rat swarm does get a free attack on you as you move past it that is going to be an 11 you can see the rats swarming up your legs and trying to get past but the armor's too thick and the chain mail's too strong underneath the plate you have and you brush them off as you move to the side pulls you right up in front of it now its giant mouth is (chomping sounds) angrily gnashing and biting down in front of you and it's sending bits of that brackish spittle across your face and smells horrifying what are you doing okay the casting time for geas is one minute knowing that every combat round is equivalent to six seconds so you could try it it probably won't survive that long but hold onto that spell for now is there another one you'd like to use sure go ahead and roll to attack sir no this one it just makes its saving throw i forgot all right cool it's going to attempt at making another dexterity saving throw that is a 14 and that does not beat it so go ahead and roll 3d8 points of damage to it radiant damage tiberius you're on deck 16 points of damage nice yes (impact sounds) once again the flames burst up and you can see parts of its body where the scarring is across it all of a sudden explode with light and beneath you can see the freshly exposed grayish-brown fleshy muscle beneath its outer armored structure it is looking a little rough that ends your turn that brings us to tiberius true strike on yourself on him attack roll against the target okay currently no there is so much going on in the room and the only light source is you right now you have no inclination that they're even at the top at this point and you're currently wrapped in a tentacle and being swarmed by rats you have no way of telling that they've even arrived at this point all righty misty step is a 2nd-level all right to where do you want to go there you go all righty ending your turn the otyugh turns around angrily now it looks it has its empty tendril it's going to step away you do get one brother kash as it steps away you get one free attack with your spear as it tries to move away from you so go ahead and roll an attack with your spear plus your attack bonus oh that definitely hits so go ahead and roll damage for the spear so as it moves away (stomping sounds) you reach out and (whoosh) hit it with the spear leaving this big old gaping wound in the side where more of its dark blood begins to spill out from the wound as it moves over it's going to go ahead and do one bite attack towards keyleth with its open mouth that's going to be a 24 all right that's going to be 16 points of piercing damage to you and make a constitution saving throw 16 you can feel the diseased liquid that fills the inside of the otyugh's mouth begin to pulse into your arm for a second you tense and eventually the pain and numbness tends to fade within a few seconds however as you take that moment to yourself as it's still grabbing you with the one tentacle it's going to reach and attack twice towards tiberius that is going to be a 16 okay that'll be a 19 so the second one hits you that is eight points of bludgeoning damage and five points so 13 half that because of stoneskin that puts you at seven points of damage and you are once again grappled and wrapped up by it i think you pissed it off when you set it on fire multiple times in a row that ends its turn vax you're up currently keyleth is right next to it 24 that hits definitely 30 points of damage all right that hits definitely eight all right you still have the rest of your movement if you want to stay up there or wish to move somewhere okay cool all right against tiberius it just has a general attack roll because you give it disadvantage on attacks that is going to be a 17 which i think misses you all right keyleth you take nine points of piercing damage as the rats are now swarming up over the side of the tentacle and biting at your neck and shoulder area and you're trying to brush them off of you rats aren't your friends anymore that finishes their turn it is now your turn keyleth yep he's looking pretty hurt blight again against this guy you are yes all right that is going to be a 13 45 points of damage from blight so this time as the rats are swarming over you you reach up your hands they're glowing with the energy that you're drawing from this you can see the actual air around her hands beginning to turn black and the air is beginning to be pulled in what was once a very moist and warm vicinity gets strangely cold as now her hands embody the end of life she grasps the tentacle and the rats scatter as the proximity grows as you touch it you can see now what was once the blight's scarring begins to fill the entire tentacle and as it turns it hardens around you almost like a brittle piece of concrete the rest of its body (cracking) you see it begins to (roars) starts thrashing about its tendril releases you tiberius dropping you into a pile of refuse as it reaches around to try and grasp its own tentacle (shattering sound) it breaks through its own arm as it reels back you fall onto your butt the rest of the broken pieces of otyugh crumbling into dust around you you look up and see the creature as it attempts to back up each one of its legs pulling up against the one door that's partially buried in the far corner it slams into the side as the blight spreads across its body its teeth begin to shatter and turn to dust within its mouth which begins to slowly curl inward as it ages extremely rapidly in a short period of time suddenly it slumps to the ground (gurgling sound) and joins the refuse of which it once came from thorbir 15 feet and it is soft ground you know what sure go ahead and make an athletics check you leap slam down on top of the rat swarm that just jettisoned off the side of keyleth i'm going to say for that impact go ahead and roll 1d6 it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from you stepping on a few of the rats six all righty and they're now all around you on the ground and they're trying to swarm away from the impact zone you still have your action yes as a fighter you do you have three attacks all right all right you swing your axe for the first batch of rats unfortunately it's hard to see where the compost pile and the rats separate you cleave through a bunch of the slimy mess slinging a bunch of it against the wall and as you spatter a bit against keyleth who's behind you roll for your next attack you decide as opposed to a small swath let's make it a wider one and your axe swings again this time you catch a singular rat but with the flat of the blade and you send it flying about ten feet where it comes back unharmed and joins the rest of its crew this time in an angry fury that you are being stifled by what is essentially sewer rats you lift your axe up in the air as one rat has climbed up your pants bites you right in the crotch in pain you drop the axe behind you and reach down and grab the rat and tear it in half out of frustration and anger and i will give you a point of damage for that it snuck up past the small little gap there and ate through your leather britches and you are in severe pain nearing prone this is true they didn't put that in the player's handbook but i think they're going to amend it too and with that thorbir's turn is up every dwarf when they hit the tender age of 30 has to wander waist-deep into the rat pits all right kashaw you're up you have the group that is currently swarming around thorbir one immediately to your left that you're batting away with your shield and one group that is currently trying to get all up in tiberius's shit for the most part everyone seems to be doing okay he's looking the roughest from a situational-- all right so there we go the rats do get a swing at you that is going to be-- that's not going to hit once again you hear the little small tings against the back of your armor but it's not even a bother at this point all right what are you doing you move up to the rats all right which i'm going to say you stayed a step back on because it's a ranged attack so you get real close once again set your spear down real fast grab your holy symbol and then release that burst go ahead and roll for attack actually no it's a saving throw again that's my end the rats roll a one go ahead and roll straight damage on that it's 3d8 it's all good eight points of damage you release it and you can see about 13 14 rats get thrown and scattered their lifeless burnt corpses (pattering sound) around and the little hole that you left in the middle of that pile closes up as the rats form once again into a coalesced swarm that ends your turn i believe that'll bring us to tiberius it's a giant cylindrical-- it looks like it was once a cistern that has been turned into some sort of a refuse-- from what you can see roll a perception check perception it's a skill you don't use it very often as far as you can see it goes up maybe 30 or so feet beyond the radius of your light spell and fades into darkness you have no idea if there's a ceiling or end to it or how far it would be if there was one you do okay go ahead and roll to attack with disadvantage yeah they're right up against you ranged attacks when you're in melee with the target it's at disadvantage okay obelisk of stone puts you up on top there all righty roll to hit first 31 yeah that hits swarm of rats not too hard to hit really 16 all right you lift up onto your ten-foot platform as this stone pushes up from beneath all of the slime and as it emerges it sends this spilling cluster of whatever was at the bottom of this you have to keep your footing as you go up in fact because of this room i'm going to go ahead and have you roll a dexterity saving throw 12 so you get the attack off but you lose your footing from the slick nature of the obelisk you just created and you will plummet off and fall prone into the refuse to the side of the obelisk but you still get the damage off on the spell as you blast-- whoa-- and tiberius you tumble off the side it's a soft impact you only fall ten feet it doesn't do any damage but you are currently prone on the ground next to your obelisk i believe that ends your turn you haven't moved yet so you could technically use your movement to get up from prone if you wanted okay cool that ends your turn he's gone vax you're up right here yes no they're all around him they're sharing the same space so a 13 that hits rats are easy to hit 31 damage total all right you notice that because of the nature of the swarm what would normally be a creature that you could do a shit-ton of damage to knowing its physicality it seems like a lot of the physical attacks aren't as effective as you would like however this swarm has already taken a few hits and as you carve through dagger after dagger eventually you pick off the remainder of the rats and the swarm is dissipated the few ones that are stragglers realizing that safety in numbers is missing begin to curl their ways back underneath the piles they clawed from originally that ends your turn at the end of your turn the other two rat swarms also realizing the circumstance is bad fight-or-flight kicks in and they flee and crawl back underneath so you all take a moment take your breath you get back up okay you've gotten back up she's still spattered-- looking on the far side it's partially buried in the ground from the collection here but you can see there is a bit of a push like the door had been opened briefly and pushed things away then slammed shut and it's slowly starting to coalesce back towards it 24 the door appears to be a normal door nothing strange about its presentation however upon checking the handle on the edge of it it does appear to be locked 28 in a matter of seconds-- this is an old-school lock and one that is generally used for not very security-required rooms flick of the wrist (click creak) the door pushes inward a little bit and you have to get your strength in to push back the cluster of dried and liquid plant matter that is rotting against it with just enough of a gap to push through into a dark room beyond it looks like you did kind of liam and he is currently the only light source yes okay glancing into the next room you can see there's a little bit of a trickle of liquid that has spilled from underneath the doorway from this room and you get the feeling this door isn't open very often if at all and the little bit of slime that has coasted through only goes about five ten feet into a long stone hallway that disappears in the darkness no more than maybe 20 feet from you even with the low light you can see pretty far to the right and left of you though sets of iron bars okay go ahead and make a perception check 25 as you begin walking into the hallway you go past and you start to notice from the visual around you there's smooth stone floor the iron bars are all the way across with some partitions between this is in particular a subterranean holding facility some sort of an underground prison and it's very quiet and there is no light in here there are sconces set up but it looks like there have been no recent torches set hearing you hear nothing it is absolutely still and quiet the rest of you guys continue with him okay glancing inside as well you can see the prison goes on for as far as your visual range is about 60 feet there are four sets of prison cells on each side so there are eight cells total and the hallway continues past that but you can't quite see beyond those initial four on each side you can glance on the inside you can see what looks like dried and brittle thatch that was once used to cover the floor has slowly molded over time to your left you see what looks to be elements of a skeletal corpse that was left for a very long period of time in the cell immediately to your left as you look through the doorway okay as you enter this area and start stepping in the air itself has a very chemical smell to it it's hard to describe there's something musty and untouched to the air but there's also some sort of gentle hint of an acrid scent do you guys continue forward through this prison area okay looking up it's about 15 feet up and it is another smooth stone ceiling the construction here looks old you specifically go ahead and make a perception check with advantage because you are a dwarf yeah roll again as you're a dwarf and this is an underground stone structure okay that's not bad looking at the stonework here it's definitely created for function more than any sort of presentory functionality you gather from looking at the nearby pieces of the stone wall that connects with the first set of metal bars that this was probably carved a few hundred years ago and the metal bars as you move past-- you guys see this too-- the doorways that lead into these some appear to be locked and some are completely open easy to swing and as you pull it open (creak) very heavy rust against those iron doors probably affected largely by the nearby moisture emanating from the room and whatever chemical's hanging in the air you're still lit by his light spell yes well that was in one room if you want to go ahead and check around go ahead and make an investigation check there is balance to the universe as you're walking past keyleth looking over on one side you see further up with a bunch of the thatch pushed around it there appears to be a corpse that doesn't have the layer of dust that a number of the other skeletal piles in some of the other cells seem to have the door to get into the cell though does appear to be locked it's hard to tell it's mostly covered with a lot of this thatch it doesn't look like it was intentionally covered but some sort of a struggle took place in this room the lock on this it's not an intricate lock but it is very heavily rusted and as soon as you start moving in there you realize that there is actually something metal that has been broken off inside whether by a previous key just through accident or intent it was broken off inside you manage to find a way to remove it pull the piece out and still get the lock open the gate swings open and you guys enter to inspect this corpse looking at it you notice that the body has been probably dead for a couple months it is in prolonged state of decomposition but there is still some semblance of flesh sloughing off the remnants of the bone you can see from the wounds that it has received that a large portion of it has been torn open very violently and elements of it have been removed the softer organs as you inspect it you look and see that while smashed with blood and dirt and dust the outfit does appear to be that of a duskmeadow bastion looking about his entire body anything of value has been taken can you what you can duskmeadow which is the section of vasselheim that worships the raven queen the guys that you encountered earlier in the road the dark studded leather armor with the cloak swept over one arm okay so as you sit down and you begin preparing your ritual you once again mutter under your breath and begrudgingly pull out your symbol as you continue casting the spell there's a slight shimmer of greenish-blue light that slowly pours over the corpse seeps into the bones and for a moment you see kashaw go into this trance-like state kashaw you see from within the corpse the face sits up with this horrible cracking bone-like sound the skeletal element with this partially mummified and mostly rotten face steps forward and the vacuous sockets that once held its eyes turn towards you and you could swear you see the bone of its grimace grin as it airily whispers towards you why do you bother me what questions do you have something that was not supposed to be here something vicious something untrue it wasn't what it seemed this woman was asking for help and no one's supposed to be down here if it's not their route occasionally we come and check on these abandoned parts of the prison a woman was here a woman should not be down here i went to ask what was wrong and she took this from me and the bony hand reaches up and gestures to the throat and you can see there's giant claw marks across the front of its spinal cord where its neck is that give the sensation that something tore its throat out aye 14 weeks have passed i was resting she walked away laughing and eating parts of me i have not seen her since but others walk these halls i've seen a dwarf pass through two or three times and as it did and passed my cell it laughed sometimes guards come to inspect but none have found me none have found me yet we are the ones to protect the amaranthine oubliette that is our job here you sit in the lower forgotten halls of the oubliette my final resting place the other hand creeps up from underneath the thatch as you guys are watching this the corpse is doing nothing it's just lying there he is talking to an unmoving corpse for your vision the hand reaches over and points in the direction you guys came from that was two weeks ago the spell fades and the corpse falls back to its original pose jaw left open aghast in its final moments just so you guys are aware you are essentially in this vicinity of the prison this was the room where you found the corpse here and you've seen just enough light begin to reveal there is a secondary prison room up here from this door yes this would've connected right there for the knife does not appear to have any sort of magical aura about it it's just a very well-crafted and probably relatively expensive piece of functionality or ornamental use it's a very fine blade though it would be a fine thing to enchant if you were inclined to so you're walking forward at this point in time as you guys are having this conversation you moved up and looked and you can see there are two humanoids walking from this direction further down this hallway which you can see leads this direction as you see them approaching here stepping in your direction they are both dressed in full duskmeadow bastion armor the one on the far end appears to be older balding with thinning gray hair the one who's further up is in his forties big thick brown beard hair pulled back into a ponytail and they're both lightly conversing to each other not paying much attention like they're running through a routine make a stealth check 19 okay as you're pushing everyone back (shushing) whispering all this you hear a voice say hello hold on hello the one with the beard approaches with his hand on his weapon the other one moving along the back you pushed them far back and into the cell okay light spell vanishes he walks up and turns the corner okay the cloak can only really cover you and partially another person the rest of you all make a stealth check no it's not enough to really effectively do it to another person it's just more for flavor 17 all right so the guy walks into the room looks back and forth the one behind him steps forward into the room a bit the other one steps behind him looks about looks from one side of the room looks over to your room there's almost a glimmer of recognition in his eye and continues walking past they just start walking back the direction you guys came from the other one-- where right there wall of stone goes up that chemical smell is getting stronger and stronger it's burning your nose a little bit okay you (sniffs) and it clears your sinuses up pretty well much like a fresh dab of wasabi your nostrils are a little more open because it's not sulfurous it doesn't have something similar to what you'd find in smithing in your experience at the very least it's hard to really place where it comes from you said you're going which way this here all right 23 you approach the door this door is locked it does not appear to be trapped okay okay as you reach down to the lock and you place the picks inside start fiddling you look at the iron around it and the actual metal seems to be frosting over you pull back your head and as you exhale your breath becomes visible and the temperature seems to drop significantly and as soon as you look up at the wood something shimmers in the wood and it's a humanoid face that just pushes out of the wood right now you guys are hearing his reaction to this just happen in the front there i'm going to go ahead and say sure so one of the hands comes through reaching out for you this ghostly arm just swings towards you i'd like to have everybody roll initiative no currently no all right so we have 20 or higher anyone all right 20 to 15 15 to ten there we go all right nine to five all right and then all right tiberius you're up first as you see these two drifting humanoid translucent ghostly entities drift out the door that vax was at as he leaps backward a second one drifts out of the stone down the hallway and turns towards the group both of them giving these horrible low moaning sounds (moans) their feet are dragging about a foot off the ground there that guy all right back away cool all right they go next this one is going to drift forward now the one that swiped at you as you dodge backward it drifts forward and its arms reach out for you and attempt to pierce the front of your chest go ahead and make a charisma saving throw keyleth you do the same as the spirit suddenly-- yes flickers and appears right before you 11 okay liam marisha and you guys watch as both of these ghostly entities (whoosh) completely slip into the physical form of vax and keyleth who each shudder for a second as their eyes glaze over both the entities are no longer visible however you feel the presence of a cold invading mind full of anger and distant loss and rage fill your brain and your body is not your own suddenly you see vax pull his daggers out and turn around and look at the rest of the group keyleth turns around and snarls at the rest of the group this twisted grin thorbir you're up closest to you would be keyleth keyleth is right next to you 24 versus keyleth what's your armor class 17 that hits keyleth you can say subdual damage it'll still damage her yeah your regular attack dice 15 points of damage to you keyleth as you get smacked broadside with the blunt edge of thorbir's axe you see this happening and in your head you're screaming trying to push this out but no matter how hard your will imposes itself your body is not your own you feel like you're restrained in a dark closet watching from a distant hallway as somebody else controls your body nine more points of damage on top of that all right i will make that the ghost creature that is a 16 what's the dc on it is this for your battlemaster for goading attack goading attack with battlemaster okay oh the dc is eight plus your proficiency bonus which would be 12 plus your-- what's your strength modifier four so that'd be 16 16 so yeah it just makes the saving throw right so that was your first two strikes vax you don't get a turn you are unable to control your body and you also do not get a saving throw you are considered possessed kash you're up you have no way of knowing how to target the creature there is no visual or physical form you just see your friend with a glazed-over look in the eyes and that cold sensation around them you have some experience with undead and you know you have some tools against them but banishment is something that you have no way of targeting the spirit within them you would have to target them physically all right what's the spell dc for you and is that wisdom saving throw on that let's see hold person wisdom all right go ahead and make a will saving throw vax or wisdom saving throw 17 16 defeats it the spell effect shimmers off all right so that finishes your turn do you want to move anywhere or are you going to stay where you are okay which way do you want to go as you move back keyleth you get an attack of opportunity on him go ahead and roll an attack with your staff as there is the mental struggle going on in keyleth's mind this swing has extreme intensity and then halfway through just streaks off and slams into the stone wall part of the staff splinters and breaks at the edge it's still functional but definitely took a hit from the wall all right that ends your turn keyleth you lose your turn up at the top of the round tiberius does anyone here at the top of this round want to make a religion check does anyone here want to make a religion check yeah you've had some experience with death and undeath in your history 20 not you 16 okay you've heard of certain creatures ghosts that can possess certain entities when a creature is possessed you know from your experience that it is very difficult to remove the possession unless it's through some sort of a ritual that forces undead away or if the actual person is brought to unconsciousness and near death themself tiberius you have the same visual on this though a little part of your brain says wait you've seen pike do something that scared undead before top of the round brings us to tiberius you don't have visual on vax currently there's a wall okay you move up to there and do it cool so currently these two stone pillars slam and crush both of you towards the ceiling well it's a dexterity saving throw right so both of you make a dexterity saving throw so take half damage so they both take the damage keyleth you fall unconscious on the ground forcing the spiritual entity out of your body okay go for it so go ahead and roll for the attack on each of them since it was forced out it is not in melee with you because it is far enough away so you straight roll for these all hit go ahead and roll damage for each just give me a total damage 23 okay you release all three scorching rays blasting into the ghost it's impacting but the bursts seem to detonate through it you can see it's taking the hits but it seems almost like because of its ethereal form it's not feeling the full brunt of the attacks it's affected by it and you can see its form being shuddered around by it but it's not as effective as you're used to them being that ends your turn tiberius this creature here okay it does not regain its possession ability it is going to use horrifying visage all of a sudden the ghost (roars) ghostbusters style it grows and it's just a horrible screaming entity i need all of you except for vax to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw 16 12 all of you guys manage to shrug off the effect you however there's something about the way it screamed that for a moment you swear it had a face similar to vesh from your wedding night it clutches your heart and you are considered frightened for the next minute that means you cannot move closer to it and your attacks against it are at a disadvantage until you shrug it off all right then the possessed vax is going to as his bonus action attempt to make a stealth check and back out of the way goes against the wall if i could have thorbir and tiberius make perception checks i'm making it for you 24 nice you failed okay you see out of the corner of your eye a couple of footsteps as vax comes rushing up you do not see it though and as vax turns the corner right here brings out the daggers and goes towards tiberius out of the corner of your eye you see a flash of light actually no you make the attack roll on this attack roll against tiberius okay right but he has advantage on you because you didn't see him so it cancels it out all right so go ahead and roll with sneak attack damage against tiberius 33 points of piercing damage against you no stoneskin you've already cast a concentration spell right but when you cast one the other one lasts for two more rounds and you started with true strike how it works is whenever you cast a new concentration spell the other one lasts for two rounds and then vanishes i think this should be the last round that you have it because it's been two rounds since you moved back so this would be the last round that you have it so you still have it but it fades after this round so halve that actually and stoneskin only works against non-magical so no you take full damage because his daggers are magic all of his daggers are magical so you take full damage and you do not have your bonus action because you used that to hide so that's the one attack you got that round's over not for this not until someone somehow forces the undead entity out of your body or drops you to zero hit points all right that brings us to thorbir correct actually keyleth make a saving throw mark off a death saving throw thorbir total of 16 17 whiffs he's too fast he ducks underneath the depth of the axe swing 18 will hit go ahead and roll damage on that goading attack okay are you rolling 2d12 for damage on that for a great axe i think it should be 1d12 i'm pretty sure (laughs) just as a note yeah the great axe is 1d12 damage that's okay so ten damage to you goading attack it failed its saving throw it rolled an 11 it failed its saving throw as you slam you can see the spiritual anger in the eyes (growls) turn towards you and it's focused on you at the moment the third strike you swing and you swear it's going right for the torso of vax and for a second you almost want to restrain because you're afraid of what it's going to do before all of a sudden both daggers catch the axe in midair and scissor-hold it before it shoves off the blade however it does appear to be focused on you does that end your turn that's okay it's a new mechanic for me too all right that brings us to brother kash you can't move closer then yes you can okay so you are all currently affected by a bless spell what a bless spell does-- if you want to read it real fast all right so do you want to move yes i think you have to be a conscious creature for the bless spell to affect you you do however get your saving throw at the end of your turn to try to shrug off the fright so roll that and you can add a d4 to it yeah with your wisdom and then add a d4 to it yes okay yeah plus d4 if you want to add it go for it you slam your foot into the ground for a second and focus and for a second the divine energy pulses through your body and you let a little bit of vesh's essence seep into you against your better judgment it gives you that sense of bravery to shrug off the fear you felt and for a second there you're like as a healing cleric undead should be afraid of you and you remember that there's an ability that you have called turn undead that may come in handy going forward that ends your turn keyleth make another saving throw 17 okay so you're still unconscious tiberius you're up (louder) tiberius you're up she's currently on the ground you can see a little bit of blood trickling out the corner of her mouth from the injury she sustained from the crushing pillar you can see a little of the light fading from her eyes you can do that yeah that will be your whole turn but yeah you can do that okay so tiberius you reach down you grab keyleth's body and you pull her back through the hallway you can get her probably about half-speed which is 30 so 15 feet that far back out of the fray go ahead and make an attack of opportunity against tiberius as he moves away total of 12 okay as you swing back you dodge out of the way as you're pulling her along the floor that's your turn this ghost entity here does not get its possession back it's going to make a withering touch against you thorbir with a 13 yeah as you reach out you manage to pull back with your axe and swing in its direction it dissipates its form for a second and the attack whiffs through the air however as you pull on that side vax comes up from behind you i want you to go ahead and do two attacks against thorbir with advantage you currently have him flanked yes that hits and another roll they both have advantage because you have him flanked okay so roll damage for both first one with sneak attack it was a total 19 i thought you rolled a 19 oh then the second one doesn't hit just the first one does all right that ends the ghosts' turn thorbir you're up you've now got the attention of both spiritual entities and your possessed friend and they're both swarming around you at the moment okay you find purchase with your third strike with your axe 16 points of slashing damage to you do you wish to move or are you going to stay where you are thorbir i'll say you can move there pretty safely move the other way all right that brings us to kashaw turn undead okay what's the radius on that 30 feet you're probably going to have to move a little closer to get them both in there all right not a problem so you're going to go ahead and turn undead as you reach up and grab your holy symbol pulling it out from under your armor once again clutching it tightly you can feel the blood begin to pour from the inside of your hand you're holding it so hard and with a flash of extremely vibrant white light with this strange halo of pitch black that surrounds it a force wave billows out from you throughout the hallway for a brief moment you see vax look over and his eyes widen for a second as the blast wave hits him both fail all right so suddenly as the blast wave hits vax the spirit is forced out of his body against the wall it pushes it out and all of a sudden you have control of your form again blown against the wall and they both halfway slide into the wall they both have a severe look of fear on their face that's going to end your turn keyleth make another saving throw so a second failed death saving throw tiberius okay just the level one all right go ahead and roll that is 2d4 plus two seven okay you heal seven hit points you come to consciousness you get rid of the saving throws you look around your eyes focus and you can see now there's these two glowing entities the ghosts that attacked the one that was inside you is now over against the wall and looks like it's dissipating and is extremely frightened by something sure you go ahead and prop her up to her feet okay for their turn they both fade into the wall and vanish from sight so all of you take a moment of stillness as the spiritual entities seem to have vanished into the wall they left after he blasted them with his shockwave of positive energy they just went into the wall yeah okay that is a greater healing potion 4d4 plus four orion and okay you kick the door open you have very little light source in here but with your vision you manage to look in past there and it looks like it's a hallway that was once used for storage of some kind but the first thing that catches you is that strange chemical smell is extremely strong in this room and your eyes burn as soon as the doorway opens and you have to close your eyes thorbir you see vax kick the door open you do not follow okay tiberius stays back you guys are all staying there superior's another 4d4 yeah you guys can take a short rest if you wish to and also use your hit dice okay both of you guys as you enter the room and your darkvision looks out you see the room that has that strong chemical scent parts of the wall have crumbled in sections ruining this long empty hallway you can see there are elements of broken boxes and crates that have been sundered or removed or destroyed in the collapse but what catches your attention too is a large portion of the floor seems to be lower than the rest of it there is some sort of a liquid that has largely overtaken the entirety of this room something has seeped through from some unseen source and has slowly over time dissolved a large pit into the center of this hallway this dull yellowish-green liquid now fills the entirety of the center portion of this hallway for a good let's say about that distance there marisha just a heads-up one of the material components is a gem-encrusted bowl that costs 1000 gold pieces that is consumed by it you can totally cast this but you'll have to deduct a thousand gold off your personal gold supply all right so as you guys take a few moments to tend to your wounds and catch your breath keyleth finds a section of the center of this dank dreary prison and concentrates taking this gem-encrusted bowl and setting it in the center of the floor as time goes on you begin to see this strange shimmering energy in the center of the room at the end of the ritual she raises her hand in the air and through a plume of whitish-silver smoke that slowly dissipates you can now see there is a long table a very well-crafted table in the center of the room with chairs and benches and an extremely well-prepared incredible-smelling meal fruits and breads and meats all just strewn about this table in the center of this prison all right you guys can use as many hit dice as you want to heal yourself if you check on your sheet it has a hit dice number use those to heal yourself naturally well no you still spend your hit dice meaning you gain 2d10 hit points so you increase the maximum and you heal up what you gained where it says hit dice on your page it should be toward the middle right above your attacks you can spend up to your top level and you roll a dice with the number you have for your hit dice and you heal that much so what's the number that you have there so you can spend up to 11 if you want to and heal up that much naturally then you don't have to worry about it you're fine use your hit dice to heal yourself you commence on the meal and it is a very delightful meal i'd say with shopping time it's probably been about six hours how long does it last so yeah you'd have to re-cast it yeah locate creature currently cannot be cast you spent all your 4th level it's 8d4 plus eight did you use your hit dice to heal yourself 8d4 plus eight big heal plus another eight yeah in this room okay were you about to do something keyleth as you look inside you walk up to the liquid it looks like there is a very slow flow to it coming at an angle it's very thick and looks like it's melted through the basis of the floor and almost like it would continue under around and out of this room into whatever is beyond you get a feeling there is something to why this part of the prison was probably abandoned okay the door is not currently locked yeah it's not trapped either look inside there is a large collapsed pile of rubble whatever this room once was has entirely collapsed on itself you can see it's pushed up against the door something made this room inert and it's not currently functional okay keyleth what are you doing you're meditating okay go for it all right the door does not appear to be trapped you don't know if it's locked yet it's hard to tell it is also from your perspective not locked or trapped okay as you're finishing your small ritual for locate creature you open up the door and it is a spiral staircase that leads upward you get the sensation this is where those earlier bastions were coming from no acid in this room no you finish locate creature and you sit there and you can sense grasping on that one encounter you had with the rakshasa though it was still disguised as a dwarf and the descriptor you have and you recognize this immediately this is the same type of ritual that you did earlier and so there's now this weird synchronous moment that you share magical knowledge and she has money though a thousand less now you finish your concentration for a second and the divine energy pulls you in a direction and it pulls you in the direction of this way there are clumps of what looks like a destroyed crate pieces of stone that have fallen from the partially collapsed walls you can only cast it on three people 6th level it's one additional person per spell level all right it's a 3rd-level spell so you can do four okay so against who everyone but you okay so as you're pulling out the flying carpet we're going to go ahead and take a break quick restroom break for about five minutes or so and we'll come right back to continue as they enter the room with a rather large pit of acid we'll be back in five minutes guys see you in a second welcome back guys before we get back to the game orion you want to talk about that video yeah that's okay it was a hell of a way to break the tension so it worked out well all right so as the rest of you have found your way into this long partially eroded hallway containing this thick green viscous liquid you have pulled out the flying carpet built by some of our amazing critters i'm going to go ahead and go with the crocheted one tonight we really do all right you drift down the hallway on the flying carpet the air itself like i said it hurts you have to continuously rub your eyes and keep them shut okay as you move partway through this section everyone make a perception check who's helming the magic carpet by the way all right so you're helming the magic carpet and you rolled a total of what natural 20 so pulling forward as you come around through the sections of the wall that are collapsed in rubble you notice that there are some sigils in the wall two-foot-high carved-stone sigils about five feet ahead of you guys there's one on each side it is not infernal they are arcane in nature though make an arcana check you can yes okay there doesn't appear to be much religious connotation to these symbols but they're old and it looks like they were placed there for a specific reason that's as much as you can get from it you can make a perception check tiberius points it out to the rest of you guys and you can see it no especially for you your experience doesn't fall too much in the realm of the arcane you can try try every skill just go through the whole list yeah there's nothing really historic about this other than the fact that you're in the historic amaranthine oubliette prison here it's not structural in looking at it it looks like these were added to it once it was built although it is a storage room so it's strange that these would be placed in the center of the room insight's more for individuals and motives okay so you push forward you push forward you get about here as you're passing through the two sigils and there's a flash from the sigils they glow bright and it's almost like two flashbulbs go off from side to side you stop the carpet dips as in the carpet goes limp okay as the carpet goes limp you all begin to plummet forward you need to go ahead and make a concentration check it's with your constitution modifier 16 okay so you cast fly multiple times people begin to lift up and then the spell fades there is something about these sigils that is cancelling magic however the carpet is now going limp and all of you are now plummeting down towards the acidic surface below your action was casting fly there is one piece of open ground here that can fit maybe two people okay go ahead and roll a concentration check constitution saving throw essentially is what it is this is to maintain your concentration as you're falling yeah unfortunately due to the jostling you're unable to get the spell out in time thorbir who else is jumping for the platform okay you go eagle form keyleth catches herself before plummeting inside and goes giant eagle form gliding past without an issue tiberius is falling i want you guys-- tiberius thorbir vax and kash-- to all make dexterity saving throws okay make an acrobatics check 27 all right what was your dex 14 17 12 so thorbir and tiberius make it onto that small platform and barely catch yourself before plummeting into the liquid however brother kash you (splash) and it's about waist-deep from where you impact (sizzling) immediately you feel this horrible corrosive burning sensation you grabbing the carpet lift and drift and come down into the section this section has eroded more and you are about to go up to your shoulders immediately the two of you suffer 18 points of acid damage so you take nine points instead you're barely catching yourself she's over the other way right now you however are submerged in the liquid now you're having to tread you are now underneath yep you are completely submerged carpet is with you it is currently (sizzling) in the acid with him yes you guys are still on the edge there you reach over and grab him-- the carpet takes 16 points of acid damage as you're taking your turn to pull it out as opposed to trying to escape from that point you take another 15 points of acid damage until eventually you're pulled out from the entire pool and carried over to the other side and then dropped on the other side both of you guys pulling the carpet out the carpet itself its color has dampened portions of the corners of the carpet have dissolved and you can see the liquid on it is still eating away at the actual fibers of the carpet you're still submerged you take another 18 points of acid damage reduced to nine again same as you took last time and what are you doing right here there's only enough room for two people currently tiberius and thorbir you can try and get on there but you'd probably push somebody else off okay athletics roll it is a very thick gloopy liquid 21 that'll be enough to get you just towards the edge and you (grunts) pull yourself out onto the side of the stonework taking a final 13 points of acid damage halved because of your armor you take seven (pants) on the side both you and kashaw are catching yourself wiping it off the parts of the flesh you can see there's scarring on your skin from where the liquid began to dissolve some of the flesh on the outer layers the carpet itself is still (sizzling) the edges of it are starting to burn away and dissolve he's across the way right now currently on the small platform with thorbir what are you guys doing right now looking at it there are parts of the walls that have slowly become pockmarked from the proximity of this caustic vitriol they're few and far between you can attempt to do a leap parkour-style but that would be a pretty hefty feat of acrobatics to do so swoop over liam and you grab thorbir they use an actual raptor sound they record from the wild to dub the eagle yeah they have to construct eagle noises in post giraffes foxes eagles so are you grabbing tiberius or thorbir okay okay you take thorbir and lift him back over magic carpet has sustained fairly hefty damage and currently the way you're reading it its enchantment is fading okay you take the mending wheel and you set it up okay as you're keeping yourself at the back you can see it's all flowing in this direction slowly it looks like there's a section of the wall here that's somewhat open and you can see there's a pathway where it's flowing through this direction and it's coasting and flowing out underneath the wall on this side so you're keeping a close eye on that you've finished assembling the mending wheel you take the flying carpet and set it on there the wheel begins to rotate and as it does the carpet curls up almost like heat to a hair curls up on its own and begins to formulate this small cluster of material you can see where a lot of its vibrant color is gone and left with dark charred and partially eaten-away cloth and cotton i'm going to ask you to make an arcana check to attempt to use your concentration and knowledge of magic enchantment to maintain it 18 vs the damage dealt okay as the wheel spins and spins you can see as the color is fading and fading and fading the spark of enchantment sputters and sputters and then the threads of the flying carpet begin to reattach and reform and areas where the damage to the carpet begin to ravel back out into a fully functional formed carpet the mending wheel eventually comes to a stop the spokes of it collapse inward and the carpet unfurls a solid seemingly untouched piece of material a mundane carpet okay okay go ahead and make a perception check yes what's the total amount of cure mass cure wounds i would say mass cure wounds as a tactical standpoint is a better thing to save for combat because it's a thing you can do one round and you can heal everybody so you'd more want to spend your level-1 spells and cure people as you go okay go for it looking at this area the wall is solid stone there is no apparent exit you take a while and inspect the wall but it just seems to be solid walls either the exit may have been part of the collapsed wall or there is no exit to this room 18 on perception looking around the wall you can see there's a section where you both look over on the far end in the corner and there is a small panel of stone that seems to have a slight mismatch in the texture of the rest of the wall as you both look at the wall you see it and you take that cue and walk up and shove the plate at the side and it (stone scraping) glides to the side slightly and there is a small three foot by three foot entryway that exits this side of the room as you guys are having this conversation thorbir has disappeared through a small pathway that he and vax both found you step through a 15-foot corridor that immediately opens into another room that has a small lower foyer area and a slight step up into a large contained room this room is not as dark as everything else you've gone through as far as light source this room has a very faint series of braziers along the walls they have almost a slight ember torchlight lighting the vicinity looking inside you can immediately see what looks to be another small stream of that same acidic vitriol that is slowly pouring across the floor and this appears to be the source that you saw before that has been trickling through and is eating into the side of the wall immediately to your left along the walls there are sets of armor of varying size they're set up as ornamental pieces in the center of the room there is a ten-foot-tall stone statue that stands before you humanoid male with slicked long hair that goes to about mid-back you see fine robes that look beautifully carved out of this dark gray stone the face is very chiseled and handsome but at the top of the forehead you see these two hooked horns that continue upward there is not two legs but one singular cloven hoof at the bottom of its torso as it stands and you can see from the eyes the source of the green acidic liquid that drips down like tears pools on the ground and spills out of the room you guys are entering after you may very much so 18 you recognize very clearly from your religious studies and your travels this is dispater who is one of the archdevils of the second layer of hell also known as the iron duke and is considered a master of politics and manipulation roll stealth politics and deception all righty i will say it's at this point that as you all assembled you hear a voice echo through the room it starts off as this low simmering growl (growls) i ask you all this question why do you hunt hotis why do you come seeking me dead so fervently that you would continue past such terrible losses and dangers looking around the room you see no source of the voice that seems to be either omnipresent or loud enough that the echoing of the walls doesn't give away any location what if i could tell you this contract you are bound to there are ways of getting around such magics why should you trust someone that with very little reason sent you to your death beneath a prison cell to die a pit of acid yet you could try and kill me and you may very well destroy me but i'll be back or we could choose to make a deal perhaps a separate contract equally binding but nowhere near as dangerous as this one and i would say as part of this deal perhaps we could do some business down the road you've already walked into my place of business and disturbed my customers and briefly nearly ended my business venture for the time being this is a very angering thing for one who spends a very long time building these ventures and i have plans i have plots looking at the both of you i can see that perhaps you are not bound by the moralities that such silly folks in vasselheim seem to cling to am i incorrect hotis (chuckles) it is the name you know that is all that is required but i think you know as well as i do for my safety i will remain unseen just as your friend has now will you let me leave we can have this conversation in the comfort of my own room in fact we can throw a small party i have the means to do so you've already proven quite skilled at combat and i would hate to think you would throw away an opportunity for what paltry sum they're offering you for a temporary victory okay as you're all taking in this still and very creepy omnipresence of this hotis character you in hearing the voice it is a very trained voice this is an individual that has spent the entirety of their life manipulating and toying with the emotions minds greed and goals of others to get its desires itself both self-preservation and progressive expansion of its own territory you can tell in its voice there is a hint of fear and a very heavy coating of words that are very well practiced and silver-tongued but you gather that there is very little intent to follow through on its side of the bargain and everything is designed as misdirection to send whatever it's made a deal with to its eventual doom that is unfortunate i would like all of you to make a perception check right now okay both keyleth and vax looking around the room there is a little hint of movement and you look over at the statue itself there's a little glimmer of something shift you see what appears to be this amulet or necklace of some kind that was resting around the statue it vanishes okay first off everyone roll initiative okay and with that 20 or higher 15 to 20 19 all right 15 to ten (laughs) look at that all right so 14 was kash 13 was keyleth and then tiberius all righty (laughs) all right top of the round you hear some footsteps there is a brief shimmering and you see across the room a form appear in the far corner you see immediately this humanoid figure appear long reddish robes humanoid body but the head itself is this dark gray feline tiger-like entity this long pronounced feline snout big fangs dripping from it long whiskers a sadistic grin on its face the amulet that was once adorning the statue now around its neck where its hands are you can see the hands are actually backwards and upturned in these nasty-looking claws it continues and releases its hands in some sort of arcane form rakshasa and with that tiberius no that's going to be on your turn there that's what the initiative roll was for i need you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw he is currently yes 4th-level counterspell so you do that so he goes and finishes a charm person spell towards you you release that with your ring and the spell dissipates from his grasp (growls) it growls under its breath he can see you yeah even though you're invisible he looked right at you and cast the spell you gather that there's something about him that can see through invisibility with that he's going to move in that direction and at the end of that that brings us to vax along the wall here okay go for it 15 misses 21 does hit all right so first one spins off second one he ducks out of the way the third one hits him in the side of the shoulder right you can roll sneak attack damage 22 damage all right it smacks into him it hits him the impact though seems to almost be partially absorbed or shrugged off you're not entirely certain it feels like it should have hit harder but nevertheless he took damage all righty are you going to stay put all righty that'll end your turn now kash you are going at the same time one of the nearby larger pieces of armor comes to life and steps forward you can now see there is a large humanoid form that is built out of a giant breastplate with the shoulder pauldrons a helmet and these giant stone-like fists and feet that come lunging forward portions of its body are made of a thick leather or wood structure as it comes bursting forward (impact noise) you can hope to make a check on your turn brother kash what are you doing okay move there further in okay cool this is about as far as you can get on this turn against which guy all right go for it yeah he gets a saving throw all right it does make its saving throw i just rolled a natural 19 so as you release the sacred flame it seems to almost ricochet off there's some sort of magical essence about this creature's construction that ends your turn this entity here is going to step forward and you can see it brings its fist up for a second there's a small gem that's embedded in one of the stone fists and you can see it's pulsing with stored energy it puts the fist forward as the rakshasa in the background as hotis instructs it and points forward towards you guys it puts the fist forward the gem glows red and then releases a very familiar-looking bead of red energy it is a spell you've already used your reaction this turn (laughs) you guys look over and see this as the red beam comes and hits the back wall and (explosion) detonates in a large fireball blast that encapsulates the entire opposite side of the room okay that would be a dexterity saving throw for all of you seven (laughs) fail 19 24 i feel like we're this close to starting the apocalypse with each one that you roll-- yeah somewhere deep beneath the vatican there's some monk who's running around screaming as their artifacts are cracking in half that's amazing all right well that is 33 points of damage to thorbir and to brother kash half of that to both of you guys it was 33 so half of that would put you at 16 you rolled a 16 it would be a 16 so you made it you take no damage (laughs) all right so that is the creature's turn it finishes its spell pulls back however the gem goes to a dull dark state no more stored magical energy kash what are you doing okay at what level you can cast it at a higher level okay okay so mass cure wounds so that is 3d8 plus five plus you get a healing bonus as you are a healing cleric as well look under your special abilities plus seven to each since it's plus your spell level too so it's plus seven on top of that yes 24 hit points did everyone keep track of that all righty so kash that's your move and that's your spell that's your turn you're done keyleth you're up all righty you cast faerie fire and you can see the energy coalesce and dissipate the rakshasa unaffected entirely by the spell okay you guys watch as keyleth now angrily morphs into this large white saber-toothed tiger that roars on the ground where she once was you can move still if you wish you have a speed of 40 i think so you can get right up next to it yep so you run around the side of the giant statue and right up in the face of hotis personally end of keyleth's turn tiberius you're up thorbir you're on deck on both of them what's the dc on it 17 the golem-like creature-- which if you want to make an arcana check right now see if you can id it 21 you haven't seen one of these before but you've heard about it in passing and you feel like there was a story once about it it's referred to as a shield guardian it is linked to whoever wears the amulet and manages to share damage should the wearer take damage it also slowly repairs itself over time so yes you cast slow the rakshasa appears unaffected however the guardian's movements do seem to shimmer and shake as it's forcing its way through the arcane net you've now cast around it yep okay so where are you going over here that's about as far as you can get away from everything all righty that brings us to thorbir you could you could probably leap over these you could do that okay you leap across grin and bear it as you dodge over the bits of acid cringing and you rush up to the side with your axe and i would say yes that hits yeah you can yeah so first roll your damage from the strike 12 slashing nice you give it to her you can roll it now and she'll add it to her damage so now he looks to you and gives you the opportunity to attack the rakshasa as a reaction to your damage 15 misses you strike out and the rakshasa right at your face ducks out of the way and has a small cane to its side that it knocks your strike to the side that's the only time all right you hit the side of its armor and deflects off the side with a loud ringing sound unfortunately no hits roll some damage on that one that's added to your attack seven damage you have two more roll your last one 28 i think will hit go ahead and roll damage you'd do that if it attacks you just do your damage all righty so out of the six strikes three make contact you're starting to carve sections into the leathery connecting areas of the shield guardian you're doing damage but it's still pretty hardy and holding itself up that ends your turn thorbir up at the top hotis who is unhappy and next to you is going to disengage here you do yes nope okay he's actually going to stay back here and is going to look over and glance at yeah he's going to glance at you vax you see this time it pulls itself back and with this grin it catches your eye and has a slight shine to its connection it whispers something under its breath make a wisdom saving throw 15 total all right for the second time in a row your mind is not your own you feel the will of the rakshasa take your mind as you are dominated by it you currently don't have visual on him there's a big statue between the two of you unfortunately the ten-foot statue so you wouldn't have visual on it when it cast the spell this is the big statue right there so you are currently dominated it is now your turn the rakshasa is going to send you up behind kash (laughs) it makes sense he comes in and heals the party and is closest to you and has no idea that you're currently turned against the rest of your allies make an attack on him he's attacking you 23 hits go ahead and do your sneak attack damage on this one i will say this make a perception check 23 you just catch out of the corner of your eye as vax turns towards you weapons drawn and swooshes up to your side you get the sensation that his mind is not his own since this has already happened once today doing so you turn to face him negating the sneak attack you're aware of it so you don't get sneak attack damage so first one was eight damage so you take eight damage the dice is doubled and then you add the modifier you deal damage and then you heal yourself ten hit points draining the life of whatever you damaged so you took another eight damage take another eight damage and then make a constitution saving throw that's okay you guys are immune to poison thanks to the meal that she made so as he eviscerates you with the daggers most of the armor's absorbing a lot of the blows and you're feeling the impact and one of them catches you in the side and you feel the poison pulse into your system but your physical body shuts it down and you feel yourself unaffected your turn to make another wisdom saving throw with advantage to try and resist it you've resisted the effect domination fades kash it's your turn as he finishes attacking he goes (grunts pants) okay go for it 30-foot radius sphere you can hit everybody here for the most part you can hit all of your allies there plus five and then plus an additional seven so it would be plus 12 3d8 plus 12 29 so everyone heals 29 hit points that is the end of your 5th-level spells you are out of 5th-levels all right that ends kash's turn the shield guardian is going to turn this way and is going to attempt to pummel on you that is a 25 to hit (laughs) the second one is a 13 okay so the first one hits you for 12 points of bludgeoning damage as the fist slams into you second one comes down and you manage to knock it away with the edge of your axe bulldogging up in its face it also heals itself ten hit points as it begins to repair its form with each progressive round the magic energy is sealing up the cracks and divots its armor is taking this leads to the end of its turn keyleth you're up correct that does hit however are your natural weapons magical that's right so yes you do bypass his nonmagical physical immunity so what's the damage total on that and what's your alignment just checking and the other two attacks are hits what does it say for the multi-attack of the tiger form saber-toothed tiger is the form you do not have multi-attack with that creature you bite in and as you do it (groans) hits you with its elbow its backward-turned hand trying to grasp out and push you off as it tears you away you got a chunk of its meat and for some reason you did a lot more damage than you thought you would you hit some sort of vulnerable point in its body or there's something about the attack method that it did not like (gasps roars) it hisses at you with this guttural tiger growl tiger on tiger you going to stay put or are you going to move away all right so you're staying right there all right tiberius you're up there center of the room all right okay there is an orb of silence here that fills the vicinity all righty all right your visibility comes back all righty that ends tiberius's turn thorbir you're up go for it that hits what did you roll it adds to the damage roll not the attack that's okay your first attack hit you have two more 16 does not hit unfortunately it beats away the edge of your blade with one of its giant fists 23 hits as it pulls back from knocking away your blade you use the inertia to spin it around and come down on top with your axe you add it before i tell you if it hit or missed so you can roll and be like i don't know if that will hit or not let me add my dice to it 11 all righty knocked away and then come down with a third hit cracking in the center of the breastplate the breastplate actually separates slightly you can see a little of the arcane energy holding it together underneath starting to knock some damage into it you can see it's taken a little wear and tear it's still pretty hefty but you're starting to dig into the shield guardian does that end your turn you get one bonus action every turn if you have an ability that uses one go for it there you go very nice ends your turn back at the top that is hotis's turn hotis begins looking at itself it moves it gets an attack from you marisha so that does hit all right you strike once again as it runs by you get a chunk out of it and it (grunts) growls in anger and pain you notice at the same time that she takes the bite out of it the guardian shudders like it suddenly took an impact on its own as it charges away though it runs out of the field of silence it is going to begin casting a spell on itself and immediately drifts up toward the ceiling it is now currently flying in the room about ten feet up right now that's going to end its turn vax you're up okay 27 okay remember in order to properly hide you would have to go somewhere where you would remain out of the sight of the individual hiding behind another party member is a little hard to do yeah thanks to your stealth roll the guardian does not see you it can't get a reaction anyway because it's slowed from you so yeah you're able to scoot around to the side there and then fling the daggers around the corner the rakshasa apparently has not noticed you that hits and it does do sneak attack damage 38 damage okay first off when you throw the dagger and it strikes it hits the side of the ribcage of the rakshasa who is floating up and (grunts) it doubles over in severe pain more than you expected it would be and it clutches and tries to grab the dagger to pull it out before it vanishes from the wound leaving the blood pooling out of it it looks like it was hurt significantly by this attack more so than you were expecting however at the same time the shield guardian doubles over for a second the link appears to be sharing the damage between the two of them apparently just when you hit the rakshasa 14 nope all right so that is vax's turn the rakshasa you can see is clutching its side now and there's blood beginning to pool around its robe and it (pants) is looking around with nervous eyes that brings us to the end of vax's turn kash you're up over here this is thorbir and vax you can yes okay all right so you create a spiritual weapon of some kind what weapon would you like to create okay so as you clutch your holy symbol to yourself now there's a sudden pillar of bright vibrant healing light surrounded by that same halo of pitch-black darkness almost like this strange border around it this duality hits the ground and as it vanishes you can see on the ground this shimmering almost static-y mace is left behind almost flickering in and out of existence it drifts off on its own and is now hovering in the air next to you do you wish to send it up okay what's the damage on the magical weapon all right so roll a d20 and add your spell attack bonus 20 hits roll damage it's 1d8 plus five which is your spell bonus okay ten points of damage all right so as it slams into the side the rakshasa (gasps) takes the brunt of it to its arm and the shield guardian shudders slightly in the distance you can use your bonus action to do that yes so it drifts behind and makes a second strike roll a d20 a d20 to try and hit and add your spell attack bonus ten this time the rakshasa's a little more wise to your plan as it swings around it actually uses its fly to dip down as it swings and then comes back up around in its place gliding and staring at it with a snarl (snarls) i believe that ends your turn now the shield guardian turns this way and now it's taken notice of the rogue that has run up and eviscerated a portion of its master it's going to pivot in place and bring both fists right down towards you okay what does that do again for one attack right well that one will be a 25 to hit and that will be a 14 to hit so the one that hits you-- 15 damage bludgeoning damage which is halved to eight damage above you it's about a 15-foot ceiling 15 to 20-foot ceiling nothing in particular no you just have the wall sconces up there this room has been repurposed from its original construction and hidden away it looks like it was initially some sort of storage or altar room based on how it was designed all right that ends its turn keyleth you're up that hits is this a pounce if you move back and then pounce you could you have the movement to do so so you back up (growls) leap and pounce on the shield guardian nope not with a three (impact noise) slow and prone seven damage all righty so as you jump on it you force it to the ground you see the thing topple towards you and you have to step back to avoid it thorbir it crashes into the ground and now minxie the white saber-toothed tiger is on top of it and starts biting and clawing at it dealing a bunch of damage to the front of its armor very cool that ends keyleth's turn tiberius you're up strangely enough none of this makes any sound it's a silent battle it is the creepiest quietest fight over here right now okay i'm looking up the spell real fast that's a natural 20 for the rakshasa and that is a six for the shield guardian i'm clarifying this because the spell says this they make a dex saving throw or they're lifted by the pillar if they make a save they are not touched by the pillar no they don't take any damage if they make their save they dodge out of the way that's how the spell is designed it's primarily intended to be a defensive spell that can occasionally be used offensively if they fail their save the shield guardian takes the damage and he's pinned currently yep wil and all right the rakshasa dodges out of the way and there is now a giant pillar in the middle of the room all right that ends your turn tiberius thorbir you're up currently it is pinned against the ceiling so you cannot hit it you can if you want to you can use your action to hold off until something triggers which could be moving into range in case you could then take your action on it not from that distance no so you'll wait for this thing to try and find its way out all right cool so that brings us to the top the rakshasa's turn the rakshasa finishes scanning the room for a second and he says well this has been a lot of fun i appreciate this little scuffle however i have other business to attend to looking at the rest of you at least i know where to hit you all the hardest i know you have a father you seek i know you have family in draconia i know you have a sister that is not too far from here and you i know you have one you hold dear to your heart i can now see your minds see their faces and i will see them soon however i must say adieu and he begins to cast-- you already used one 4th-level counterspell from your ring earlier how do you have two 4th-level counterspells in a ring that can carry up to four levels of a spell it can carry up to four levels of spells welcome to dungeons and dragons it's all good you have counterspell as a spell you know though right okay good to know that makes a difference let me double-check one thing real fast because this will make or break the circumstance really all right all right it is a 7th-level spell so let's go ahead and roll okay don't roll yet okay so roll a d20 and your spell-casting ability is five for this so you roll a d20 add a five i will say you have advantage on this because you were expecting and waiting for this so go ahead and make your first roll roll one at a time 19 all right 19 all right to counter this spell as a level seven you needed to roll a 17 or higher you are targeting the spell not the rakshasa itself as you can see its form begins to shimmer and you see a small gate begin to open around its form you as a reaction reach up and unleash your torrent of countering arcane energy it hits this opening gate the gate then fluctuates and shuts at which point the rakshasa goes (quiet growl) and for the first time really in this entire battle looks genuinely scared don't break your hand it's going to fly-- actually it's going to fly toward the door yeah that's all the movement it can get there but it is heading towards the exit he's gliding toward the doorway over everybody that brings us to vax's turn from this statue here at that height i'd say it's about 30 feet you're partially obscured by the statue i'd say you can do that he did not see you stealth actually he did not roll high enough perception so you have sneak attack on him 30 damage how do you want to do this (cheering) the dagger hits it in the back of the neck and the spine it doesn't quite cut through the spinal column you see it comes out the front of the throat (choking noise) the spell falters (thud) it falls to the ground taking a serious impact fall and is now (grunts) dragging itself towards the exit of the room as you start walking up to collect your blade (coughing gasping) it brings up its hand to start trying to cast a spell (wet choking sound) it coughs this big pool of blood onto the ground (death rattle) with a spray of crimson across the ground and this horrible sucking sound you pull back the head as the life force of the rakshasa comes spraying across the stone floor as you release it and leave it to the ground with the last bit of life left in its body leaves its form you hear this chuckle i'll find you (laughs) the body tumbles into the acid (sizzling sound) you guys run over really quickly and pull it out the shield guardian that was currently struggling has gone limp pinned against the ceiling does nobody have the contract it might have ended up in the storage the actual physical contract that would have been a real shame to get all this far gives you advantage on those yeah correct roll two at a time to make it more expedient well it's with advantage so the first roll's a 20 that's for the eyes without a problem pop both eyes out there is a purpose you serve 16 all right with some difficulty you manage to eventually tear the heart out of the chest cavity it's a very nasty process and most of you guys-- well not so much you guys you've seen a lot of crimson but watching this little druid girl seemingly unfazed by the process of tearing into the chest of this rakshasa is very disconcerting and it is this dark dull red like overcooked meat you take each one of the hands of the rakshasa the back-turned strange upside-down humanoid hands and cut them off at the wrists very cleanly and both are harvested without issue 25 total you take the rest of the head you can see this terrible grin this perpetually pulled smile from its final moments you manage to pull out very cleanly both of the canines from the inside of the mouth it's a little difficult since a rather large portion of the rakshasa's blood is currently spattered across the floor thanks to vax you manage to harvest one vial of its blood one vial you currently have a vial of rakshasa shave scum the dagger is left there as a proclaiment and all of you feel the weight behind that whispered statement and decide it might be best to leave that dagger where it sits as you've completed the harvesting you notice the contract the sigils that currently lock it flash and seem to vanish from the paper your contract completed for the sake of brevity you all manage to make your way-- arduously and with much difficulty-- not through the amaranthine oubliette because that would be difficult but retracing your steps back through a tunnel which has been sealed shut by iron pillars that's a terrible idea creating explosions in small enclosed earthen tunnels is a really good idea they completed the contract but then all suffocated due to a sudden cave-in it was so unfortunate the second team everyone's just permanently breathing air it is the worst fate ever for a pc it takes you a long time to retrace your steps and find your way through the entrapment especially since as you remove the iron pillars the boulder then begins to roll past so you carve your way through you make your way precariously back to the velvet cabaret back into the room where the rakshasa once lived do you wish to walk into the center of the velvet cabaret covered in various fluids all right (boof) the door slams open and you all step into the center of the velvet cabaret as you do two of the guards turn and see you exit hey hey wait what are you doing and they go for their blades to the side make an intimidation check 14 he rolled a three he looks to the other guy as long as you're leaving he sheathes the sword and they give a wide berth you can hear the music playing and everyone's laughing as you enter the room the music comes to a stop he steps back for a second some of the other patrons are watching this some look scared some look intrigued by this whole sudden arrival of strange warriors covered in various ichor watching as you step out a swarm of them look at the feet and one of them goes oh they killed some sort of tiger that's not an accent (laughter) no one argues as you sip you make your way through the main thoroughfare back to the center of the quad roads to the slayer's take guildhall you step inside and there across the way in mid-conversation with his wife is mertin talking to the huntmaster vanessa as you enter they both turn with a look of excited surprise i assume that this means the contract went well right (excited chuckles) he shows it to the huntmaster she glances down with a smile very good i am glad that we gave you such a trusted member as your overseer you did well thorbir thank you for your effort in keeping these fledglings alive it's not meant as an insult i'm sorry perhaps you do not understand that we speak with terms of endearment very well so looking at the contract is everything hopefully in order she takes it from you looks into the contents of the bag very well you shall be paid out in full and scattered amongst your party as you see fit not yet they are still out at the moment they've been gone for about as long as you have been you've returned faster than they have let us hope that they are safe but i have faith they seemed very intent on completing this without issue so i would not be too worried i will notify you upon their return though where are you staying you could if you like we have room and technically as of this contract you are all officially members of the take you may stay here if you wish very well we shall hold off the ceremony for when the rest of your team arrives she crosses her arms and her usual jovial passive attitude grows a little more stern she gives a nod of genuine respect towards thorbir and for the first time she looks about the rest of you with a slightly intense look of really understanding the essence of strength between and behind each of you i believe you're correct i think there will be great things ahead for us welcome to the slayer's take she reaches down brings up a small wooden chest sets it on the edge and opens it on the inside you can see it is rather abundant in gold and platinum of which the total comes to-- (counts quietly) 5100 gold pieces for this contract that is 1020 gold each correct it has if you insist but you know that whenever you come back to our little humble abode you always have a place to stay and work at your disposal brother kash very well welcome to the slayer's take and with that we'll close this evening's session (laughter) well done guys there were a few seriously clutch moments in those encounters there you were one roll away from losing the contract congrats on that guys well done please round of
