have you got your dice and your character sheets ready you ready so with that let's go ahead and kick back into the mood of the current venture into whitestone now the party of vox machina having traveled across tal'dorei to the city of whitestone to seek a pair of seemingly vicious and evil individuals known as lord and lady briarwood members of the past that percy's family fell to oh so many years ago leaving what he thought was the sole survivor to the de rolo family upon coming to whitestone finding its people downtrodden and oppressed by the briarwood rule as well as the cutthroats and mercenaries that they had brought along with them when they took the city now given lordship and plots of land and rule over this entire town the word began to spread of possible new rebellion as you charged through the town leaving burned marks burned houses and very slaughtered people in the process very bad people as these murmurs continue to roll and coalesce you spoke to a number of individuals in the city that were involved in previous failed rebellions and seemed to build up what may be the last chance for whitestone as part of this information was revealed that percy's thought-dead sister cassandra still existed within the castle and had been what people thought the only living de rolo and bastion of hope in the city now there were two upon triggering the initiation of this the party split scanlan shorthalt running to one of the nobles while the rest of the party went to the other to set a diversion at the same time (laughs) it may not have worked out as intended but it definitely worked as we had an epic bard versus goliath rainstorm rooftop showdown the rest of the party made their way into count tylieri's home destroyed his vampiric self and got some information out of the guards before escaping into the town which has now gone into chaos many of townsfolk have become the militia that they've been preparing to be armored with whatever they can find they've managed to take down a number of the large hulking zombie giant guardians throughout the city many lives were lost in the process and the battle is ongoing as you rushed towards the center of the town to check in on the sun tree finding all the previous bodies that resembled members of vox machina cut from its boughs you saw swarming in towards the center of the city a large horde of skeletal undead clattering forth into the dark as the sun has now set over the horizon the rain beginning to pour heavily into the center of the town there was efforts meant to keep the army at bay as you all rushed towards the west to escape the immediate fray and that was where we left off last session you guys haven't gotten to the tree line yet no at this time you are on trinket the rest of you are running through the muddy streets your feet are slick against the ground and you have to catch yourself every now and then from not tumbling forward as you glance over they're just now starting to pour from the town square itself and it was hard to see the exact number but from your perspective in the darkened kind of just post-sunset light you didn't see the end of it possibly from what you can tell in the middle of the chaos from rushing there was a zombie giant behind you that did manage to finish off some of the villagers before coming after you in your haste in escape with the help of a few of you individuals who managed to tear it down slaughtering it as it gave chase through the city street as you guys are now looking behind and seeing this undead horde pouring into the central road that you're traveling along you hear a voice ring out from the other direction toward where you guys are running for a second it's hard to make out what it is but the voice is suddenly readily familiar it says there run aid them and as you guys glance away from the army and back towards the path where you were traveling you see what looks to be about ten armed villagers various pieces of armor some nicer than others some have seen some use over time but nevertheless serviceable and functional you see at the front of them brother yennan sorry keeper yennan is at the front of them armored up shield at his side holding aloft the holy symbol of erathis in his hand and they're all just running towards you guys (heavy footfalls) you'd probably have to slow down to do that because you're a good like probably 50 60 feet away from them if not a little further you guys are moving faster than them so that even the chase they're not very quick entities they're about a hundred feet from you and closing go ahead and make-- this is technically breaking a grapple okay so so trinket begins to turn around you're fighting it would be either acrobatics or athletics versus your athletics with that the slick rain across her forearm (swish) she squeaks her arm out from your grasp and with that moment you feel her disappear as she rushes back towards this undead onslaught keep in mind you still have call lightning coming so you would be losing the call lightning at this time okay so with that the darkened clouds that had gathered begin to slowly disperse as you begin to focus running forward as you are charging using the momentum the air around you begins to slowly grow and ignite before a ball of flame bursts into your peripheral and you can control it at will at this point now they're about 30 feet away since you went right back towards them as opposed to running away you're now because you gave chase shortly after she ran off so you guys are about tandem about 20 feet all right so conjure barrage what what's the distance on conjure barrage okay then yeah you can definitely attempt that okay so as you create this sphere and it's rolling to your side as you begin to concentrate and look over your shoulder and you see trinket (heavy steps) running up with just mud slung as each one of his claws begins digging into the earth pulling him forward (bear roars) on his back you see vex pull out an arrow pull back and concentrate the arrow itself seems to split and shatter in her hand almost like the wood itself divides into five or six different shards as you release the arrow it bursts into a funneling cloud of sharp wooden splinters that fires out from the front of you what's the dc on that spell 15 dc and is that dex dexterity all righty the ones that are in range would be about 12 at that point okay given the average of rolls there the explosion of splinters just shoots outward just completely disintegrating the first row of about five or six of them about five or six past them get a bunch of splinter in their bone their rib cages shatter open and they (skeletal gargle) try and move forward before they collapse in on their own structure and (clatter) scatter into the mud let's say you destroyed ten of them you can still see about 50 or 60 slow pushing towards you at this point in time keyleth you guys left the sun tree and you've gone westward it would be from your perspective westward across the city towards the treeline you're now doubling back at this point however the undead horde has filtered into the town square and is currently between you and the sun tree okay and the width of it's going to cover the entire street okay (swoosh) the wall of stone lifts you up at its maximum height what's the maximum height of that spell can you repeat that i lost my phone for my app so i'm going to use this book here so ten feet all right so (whoosh) you're lifted ten feet up into the air you can now see about to crash into the wall what looks 70 or so skeletons just (crashing noise) scraping into it you guys can all of a sudden hear through the rainfall in the distance this scratching of metal shields and blades and bones scraping at the stone wall and (skeletal hissing) hissing and clattering okay okay the flaming sphere begins to move over the wall you've done your action and you begin to push that forward because the sphere moving through you would get to about your space so next turn we'll get to that you guys have caught up to the wall now the rest of you have turned around with her okay percy okay you guys get up on top of the wall it's about four or five feet thick it's a little precarious but not too much to really bother you guys you get to the top and you look over and you see this sea of thrashing about skeletal entities some looking fresher than others and all intent on trying to find some way-- and you start to see some of them starting to climb up over each other to get to the height of the wall okay make a perception check the rainfall is too thick right now your vision is so obscured that even beyond 50 60 feet it starts getting a little hard to make out details the keeper says fire won't help but i can sam and and so can she as he looks over his shoulder you can see the villagers are parting and there is running behind them this form of a small humanoid armored entity but glowing her actual form is comprised of glowing radiant energy like an actual avatar of sarenrae in the form of a tiny gnome cleric just charging through the rain each droplet of rain that hits her body (sizzling) just immediately evaporates on impact and she comes charging towards you guys all right as you guys reach down and she runs up keeper yennan reaches up and grabs on the arm as well as she gets up and the two of them together lift up on top and as you grab her arm it's strange it's warm to the touch warmer than a natural arm and it doesn't have full physical essence to it it's almost like she's partially an apparition of her physical self there is purchase there is an actual form to it but it doesn't feel fully solid with that you lift her up and she's lighter than you recall and almost like a gentle feather of herself she (light footfall) lands onto her toes on the top of the wall i know yeah as you look down before you and there is a horde of skeletons that are right now about to crush the wall you see two right now that are lashing out one reaches for your leg okay go for it all right go ahead and roll damage whoever sent in that d20 with the rocketing (blast) sound the pepperbox fires and the skeleton in front of you just explodes into splinters of bone just being scattered amongst the crowd of skeletons behind it however the moment that that one is gone another one seems to already be crawling into its place okay fire again what is it 24 11 points of damage (gunshot) it fires and blasts off most of the skull on the skeleton and you can see its jaw hangs open but it still (skeletal hiss) okay that one you clearly destroy the top of its skull the rest of it just crumples into the pile and disperses amongst the chaos the horde though is now as almost like a wave there's so much of it that's pushing up against the wall and beginning to swell up to reach the top of the ten-foot wall the flaming sphere rolls over the top and slams down into the front of the group as it hits and impacts go ahead and roll the damage all righty and what's the-- okay one three nine 20 one i'm doing general rolls for this it pushes through ten of them seven of them are destroyed the bone cinders and burns and then crumples into itself a few of them manage to push out of the way kind of (growls) watching as it rolls past you can hear this constant pattering of rain evaporating against the flaming sphere (sizzling) as it pushes through the mud boiling left in its wake as that's happening you get up to the top trinket pushes you up on the top okay go for it 16 16 definitely hits yeah 19 damage okay so the first one takes full damage (impact noise) explodes as the lightning arcs through the air the arrow hitting the central skeleton you see the light actually burst into the back of its skull causing this blueish-green glow to shoot out of its eyes and mouth as it explodes and detonates exactly ten feet total that would be wow yeah (laughs) general saves on this i'm rolling for shit all right so with that (blast) the shock wave blasts outward and you see skeletons being thrown-- pieces of skeletons arms and weapons and pieces of shield and armor being flung in the air as you see 12 of them immediately disintegrate and explode around it in that moment though the horde pushes again and fills that gap almost instantly you do see the end of it now at this point it looks to be probably a total of 65 left in this section roll a perception check 11 okay don't worry about it all right that's easy enough for a ten-foot wall oh and for a gnome so with that scanlan leaps up and you land next to pike and with that both scanlan and pike what do you guys want to do you can you can yeah or destroy undead you have access to both it's a 30-foot radius all right so i need you to go ahead and make an athletics check to see how far you can jump if you don't mind rolling athletics (laughs) and what's your athletics (laughs) it's a little late for that unfortunately what's your total okay just get in the swing of it first it's all good that's pretty fantastic okay then given that circumstance you in this sunny radiant form you reach back and leap into the air and for a split second you see with a flash of light almost like these momentary feather angel wings burst out of the shoulders of pike that (whoosh) flap once and then disperse into sparkling feathers that vanish under the rain as pike leaps out landing 35 feet in the center of this on top of a skeleton you slide down its body as its shield pushes you off to the ground and you land on your feet and as far as you can tell from your eye-line all you see are chattering skulls and blades around you for all visual perspectives and a little bit of the skyline above you a little bit of the clouded night sky so pike are you going to use your action to destroy undead okay wow what's your spell dc be on your spell page 16 good to know that's wisdom they're minus one wisdom okay so as you see all the skeletons begin to reach for you and their blades come pulling down towards your armor you curl into a ball clutch your holy symbol of sarenrae and through the connection that has allowed you to be here in this moment you feel this welling of radiant energy just burst out from you in this shock wave of glowing radiant force just (explosion noise) blast outward for that entire blast wave radius which would be the entirety of this road leading back for about 60 feet you end up turning to ash roughly 36 of these skeletons just (explosion noise) the rain itself is disintegrated by the sudden wave of heat and there is just a cloud of ash that turns to mud immediately against the rain and slams against the nearby buildings slowly dripping down the sides pieces of metal armor just go slamming to the ground rolling (clanking) into piles and piles of currently unused weapons as you look up you can see the remainder of the horde which you're looking at probably about at this point 20 or so skeletons still pushing forward at this point just mindlessly rushing towards the closest thing they can see which is this glowing beacon of a gnome in the center of the street all right so scanlan what do you want to do they're going to be acting after this so they're about 30 feet away from her so just outside of the radius of her spell she did yes if you want to try okay it's athletics the wall itself is slick and as you push down you lose your traction on the front it doesn't cause you to fall per se but you manage to get ten feet off the actual wall landing (boof) with a thud in the dirt and pike still 25 feet away from you i'm going to say that's going to be your move the 20 or so that are left are currently 55 feet from you and beyond they are they're very clumped together all their friends just turned to ash and they're now starting to climb over the armor to find their way towards pike not if you angle it towards the edge all right out of your body in a straight line if you would like to an arcane display of virility if ever there was one scanlan does a singular classic ancient technique the arcane thrust and with such (boosh) a bolt of energy goes firing out just barely arcing around pike's form and slamming into a row of skeletons go ahead and roll your 8d6 and what's the dc on your spell i will say because you're doing the thrust you do not get the cone on this one 17 not for skeletons 22 all right so the bolt (electric spark) arcs through and slams into seven of them what was the total damage there you said the total damage was 22 okay yeah so two of them survive you can see their kind of burnt charred forms and one of them's missing an arm now and the armor itself is still (electricity noise) arcing little bits of energy five of them however just explode into black burning bone chips at which point you can now see bolts of lightning are (lightning strike) coming down from the storm in the distance too as the thunderstorm itself is reaching more of a fervored pace the rain itself getting harder and harder on you guys so with that you can see looking over your shoulder on the other side of this wall another bit of skeletal horde is starting to come down one of the nearby intersections and it's starting to come around the other side of you guys you do see however that the ten villagers and keeper yennan are currently rushing towards that group to hold them at bay and keeper looks back over his shoulder and says you don't worry we've got this you do what you must it has begun finish it and goes charging forward holding his shield forward rushing towards the group of skeletons the skeletons however-- you have to do something at this point hold your turn okay the remaining 13 or so skeletons use their full movement to get up only three of which can actually get into combat range with pike since their speed is only 30 that radius really messed them up man glad you could make it tonight (laughter) they are yes okay so you'll get there simultaneously you'll be doing your action simultaneously so you run off the wall (running steps) and make it up not a problem at all with speed pike as you see the rest of the skeletons zoning in on you vax suddenly just rushes to your side daggers at the ready three skeletons are going to take swipes at pike that is a 17 nope oh it's a seven oh skeletons and that is a 12 yeah two of them try and swipe and you just knock it out of the way with your shield a third one does hit you in the front of the chest but the armor deflects it entirely and the blade actually sinks a little bit into your form but the radiant energy that holds your position there just pushes it off and the blade itself seems to almost dull from the impact you're up well the final seven that are currently there are within range if you wish to attack any of them there are three that are currently in melee with her there's a skeleton right next to both you and pike go for it so if you're just physically punching this is strength-based so roll a d20 add your strength modifier and your proficiency-- although it's unarmed strike so i don't know if you're proficient with unarmed strikes okay what did you roll on the dice yeah you hit the symbol of sarenrae okay go ahead and roll 1d2 plus your strength modifier damage roll a d4 and divide it by two what's your modifier for strength so you do three points of vax fist damage right to the skull (crushing sound) it hurts at impact and you feel like the bone wobbled as the skull (bone ratchety noise) back towards you but well done that was a fun round (laughs) true enough if you want to make an athletics check to leap up and use that to jump off you-- mister athletic movement and high speed rolled a 19 i'll say you leap up on the wall use that as kind of a stepping point and jump as far as you can you get 20 feet forward beyond the wall (heavy landing) land with your hammer to your side (flames ignite) flames flickering off the edge of it you still have-- i'd give you 20 more feet of movement at this point because you're a crazy-fast barbarian you'd be able to reach two of them right on the other side of pike okay go for it 26 that definitely hits roll for damage on the first one 12 damage how much is the war hammer of that not the fire damage 11 okay as you smack into it you can see the bones themselves are brittle by nature but the solid slamming force of a thick piece of honed metal into the side of this bone-brittle creature just sends it shattering to the side you get the feeling that these entities are particularly fragile against bludgeoning weapons so your first strike just scatters one of the skeletons across the ground you have one more in your reach if you want to go for your second attack okay 20 go ahead and roll damage on that one (explosion noise) the second one just explodes up into the air you can see one of its shields goes flying off and lands on one of the roofs almost like walter white's pizza as great weapon master i believe if you kill something you also can use a bonus action to get a third attack outside of your frenzied rage so i mean nothing's in-- right now in melee range for you but if you wanted to throw your hammer you could correct i'm saying as part of great weapon master you can not rage kill something and then get a free attack with your weapon (laughs) so with the chain of returning attached to your hammer you go ahead and (propeller noise) send it swinging towards one of the further skeletons 25 definitely hits go ahead and roll damage 14 doubled due to the bludgeoning vulnerability on the initial impact the hammer slams into its rib cage causing it to cave inward its entire upper body just falls into itself as the hammer not meeting any resistance goes beyond and (impact) splotches into the mud go ahead and make your athletics check to try and pull the hammer back kind of technically 13 you just (sucking noise) pull it out with a sickening sound (thunk) catch it in the air the blood dripping-- the mud dripping off of it but you see it burning away as the flames begin to burst through the actual mud burns some of the taste buds as the searing hot edge of of the hammer reaches your tongue all right that ends that round there are now currently four skeletons on this side we'll say for the sake of brevity you manage to in the next round or so just destroy them the flaming sphere itself can just bash through them so you're on two sides of the wall the rain's pouring so heavily (lightning crash) there's a flash in the distance of lightning i want everyone to roll perception so you got 20 you see in the flash of lightning in the distance you can see just barely on the other side of the town square what looks like the outline of a giant currently slamming into something and out of the corner of your eye you see a second one to the south side of the city there are still a few of these giant sentinels out there they don't look too terribly close but they're still on the rampage as you're shouting this over he is currently about 40 feet away right now slamming into a front line of skeletons grabbing his own holy symbol and you see another similar burst of energy to the one that pike let out earlier (explosion) that same dull bass-y impact sound you feel a shudder in the ground beneath you as a series of more skeletons are immediately disintegrated in his proximity looks over his shoulder until morning why wait until morning we're fighting now one to the east one to the south okay who's taking whom all right so we have grog and the two gnomes and the rest of you who's going which direction currently to the south and east all right grog and gnomes you guys are going to the south all right as you guys dart off making your way around the still very ominous and creepy sun tree to your left you can see all the various muddy prints of all the scraping skeletons that came through here and in the distance you can still hear echoing shouts combat shouts commands being sent throughout there's still very much an aggressive presence of the resistance in this city you have no idea whether or not it's on the winning or losing side at this moment but it is still active you guys divide at this point starting with you guys grog holding both the gnomes and you can feel pike is lighter than normal and you know her weight quite well as you're used to putting her up on your shoulders from growing up with her and in recent years but there's also this strange kind of vibration to her body like it's not physically there but yet it does feel like there is physical presence as you're rushing through the rain acknowledging this you make your way to the bottom of the square charging through you almost slip at one point and catch yourself head past one street a second street and to the left as you glance off you can see there is another patch of skeletons and currently about five villagers that are just trying to tear through them you see a couple of bodies of villagers that have recently been killed there's one that's actually still partially alive on the ground it's like dragging itself through the mud in your direction like (gasping grunting) rain pouring down there's a big trail of mud and blood currently behind him as he's making his way towards you guys (gasp) help what are you doing grog okay so you rush up to this guy as you get up to him you see his face is half-covered in blood his side is very heavily wounded it looks like he took some sort of a spear wound that then tore through his midsection he has been bleeding out pretty heavily at this point and probably doesn't have much longer to him as you bring pike down below him pike what are you going to do what level okay so go ahead and roll for that all right 3d8 plus five 23 okay so as you reach forward he looks up at you like he's seeing an angel walk towards him and looks scared he's like no not yet not yet and as you reach forward and touch the sides of his face with your smile of mercy and understanding your warm hands touch the sides of his head and the energy of sarenrae's blessing pours through his body you can see the insides of his armor begin to give this soft glow from where the wounds are as they close up you can see the large gash in his side begin to stitch itself up magically and at that point he takes a deep breath for a second and kind of turns over and is now in sitting position breathing heavily looking around himself confused you you're an angel a bloody right angel he reaches out for you with his hand forward thank you he gets up and he still seems sore and bruised and there's still wounds across his body but he's no longer on the path to terminal loss of his life he stands up okay okay thank you oh i intend to and he reaches over in the mud and finds his sword wipes it off from the side (war cry) turns around and rushes back in to the rest of his allies okay you guys go charging back into the storm from the south side (skype sound) we've lost pike technology as you guys continue running forward you go past two city streets the whole city's dark now it's closed down in preparation for what this evening is going to entail so you go past these two streets to the left immediately you hear the familiar sound of a large heavy mass slamming into the ground and as soon as you turn the corner you can see there are three people left in this one resistance brigade there is a pile of wounded and/or killed soldiers around its feet and it looks like it's been nearly untouched this one apparently got the drop on them or at least they weren't fully prepared for what they were up against and it's just swinging this giant club in the air around towards them they're all kind of keeping their distance not knowing if they should run or keep fighting as you just turn around the corner i want you guys to roll initiative fantastic should be fine there she is turned this way right now they're all keeping their distance at this point all right so initiatives for that oh all right all right so initiatives are sam and all righty all right grog and scanlan you guys are up first okay and how many total do you have on there okay got you so seven is the max you can hold for that okay so you're using the last of yours for this this is the last okay got you okay got you then go ahead and roll for that well for magic missile you keep firing-- yeah you don't have to roll they all hit automatically that's the good thing about magic missile it just hits all right so you create three darts so it's 3d4 plus three and then if you're casting it at 6th-level you said all right that'll be an additional five darts 8d4 plus eight 25 points of damage to the giant as you jump off grog's shoulder pull out your wand it all of a sudden glows for a second and from that point like a swarming anime missile storm these unerringly hitting arcane missiles slamming into the sides of the giant (growls) you can see bits of its flesh unfolding and spilling off to the side exposing some bone underneath as all of a sudden its attention shifts looking over its shoulder at the three of you as it begins to right itself preparing being flanked on each side a little bit of undead intelligence within its brain knowing how to defend itself (growls) you're right here on the side of grog okay so you're kind of hiding around the wall of the one of the buildings and as you dart to the side kind of glancing around the corner all righty take your d10 inspiration grog you're up hearing this beat in the back of your head as scanlan's stomping his foot-- you guys are almost in the same position there oh you're spooning go for it that hits there's no other current combat target so you can roll all three it's fine hits hits he's very slow-moving and a very large target he's very easy to hit thankfully so as you rush up first what you got 22 nice nice nice (whack) you slam the hammer into the side of one of its calves it buckles for a second and you can see the muscle itself kind of snap and a piece of bone is now jutting out of the side of its leg with that you swing the hammer around and slam it into the bone actually jamming it deeper into its leg (all yell) as you pull back these slow flames kind of burning the outside you can see the flesh sizzling with the impact of the burning hammer swing it once in your hand whack onto the other side this time the actual leg bursts out that side and it falls almost a little bit it's sort of walking on this stump of a leg now you pretty much destroyed the bottom half of its middle of its calf to its foot it's just slumping over the toe's still kind of wiggling on its own it's now half on part of its leg as at this point it kind of rotates in place towards you now using one hand to get around as it brings this club up looking up into its face now as you haven't really had a close-up on this it's strange to see you see there are similar features you've encountered stone giants this up close and this personal there is where your brethren your blood comes from however half of its face is torn off by some sort of large claw mark where there would be an eye is just this sunken socket and there are these streaks of dried blood that long before the rainstorm came are just smeared across the face and part of its jaw is broken open and you can see jagged broken teeth underneath its tongue lolls out the side and it just (undead groan) reaches up with its club to come on down (laughs) all right so the first it's going to come down and strike you with this giant club-like piece of heavy wood and metal that's a natural 20 that's an 18 plus nine so it's-- well no that's to hit all right so first strike comes at you for 16 points of bludgeoning damage halved to eight the other one comes to you at 14 points of bludgeoning damage halved to seven it looks very very angry and very frustrated with the current circumstance but you take each blow to the chest showing off that strength you normally would do to something of your kin and ilk even though it's not really living old habits are hard to break finishing its turn three resistance members rush into its side as it's now turned to face you with its broken leg rushing in strike it hits hits hits all have short swords out and they're just stabbing it in the side of its body now that they have this opening and this distraction in the current moment five five five which is 21 points of slashing damage from all three of them just stabbing it with a blade in the side that ends its turn bringing it to the top pike you're up yeah now it's your turn yep everyone else went it's your turn okay you got this so go ahead and make a ranged spell attack roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier okay are you casting it at 1st level or a higher level okay all right and what'd you roll 17 definitely hits so go ahead and roll 7d6 radiant damage 7d6 radiant damage actually this is a single-target spell there's no radius to this what's your total damage 24 points of radiant damage okay so as you stand there for a second you pull your holy symbol up kind of putting your shield to the side and as you release your hand out in front of you this beam of divine energy streaks out slamming into the zombie giant as it hits it continues to burn like a stream into its body searing the flesh in a path as it does as it impacts it leaves this glowing pulsing divine symbol across its chest of sarenrae the next attack against it has advantage no the next person to attack it gets advantage no no she was very precise with her impact on the giant all right do you want to move on your turn at all pike stay where you are or do you want to move close to it okay you'll stay where you are okay you keep your distance from it let grog do his thing okay that brings us to the top of the round grog scanlan you guys are up again (laughs) okay the thing is you can use the minus five to hit plus ten to damage it's what he's been doing there you go 16 hits once again big target not very hard to hit just has a lot of hit points 16 also hits all right all three hit okay 25 all righty 33 points of damage all right so as you swing the hammer upward (whack) it hits along the side of its skull and you can see its skull actually cave in and crack a bit bone and flesh scraped away where it cracks you can see a bit of black brain mass begin to leak through using that you spin the hammer around and hit it again the same place (whack) finding the weak point this time just the anger to smash through (impact sound) it caves inward and you can see bits of bone jam into its one semi-functioning eye its head now loosely pushed in on one side the jaw hangs a little bit loose the third strike you come down (whack) hit it from the other side the jaw dislodges and goes flying off but it's still standing his head's still there his jaw is dislodged the lower half of his jaw is missing it's just this open part his tongue dangling loosely out of the bottom part of its head caved inward just (deep zombie groan) are you going to stay where you are grog all right scanlan you're up you can move 25 feet so five squares you're a little gnome dude you have little legs you can but at pretty much every angle you're going to hit somebody aside from the giant what are you doing he's tall he's down a little bit because of the impact that grog gave but at a higher angle you could probably hit him without hitting the other guy you're william wallace-ing it all right so 8d6 damage does not make its saving throw with a three very true sadly 28 points of damage all right (lightning crash) the bolt of lightning shoots off into the sky arcing through its body you can see where part of its neck muscle was torn it fuses into its shoulder from the impact of the bolt (moans) almost falls over from the blast however it catches itself and (grunts) gets right back up it's looking pretty rough but it's still keeping itself there yeah that ends your turn all right pike you get a d10 inspiration dice from scanlan a voice you've longed to hear for some time as your friendship has been so far away take your 1d10 all right so on the zombie giant's turn it recovers from the bolt of lightning looking at this large target in front of it it sees this tiny little morsel and you see it brings up its leg that's partially destroyed and (heavy footsteps) begins to move forward just to there to get you within range it's going to move a little closer it gets two attacks of opportunity from the guards behind it that somehow actually misses with a two that does hit though so it takes-- oh nice-- eight points of slashing damage from one of the guards that as it runs by just swings out and slashes across its thigh as it comes up towards you it (zombie groan) its tongue dangling out this horrible gurgling sound coming out of what is now technically its open throat as it brings its club upward-- okay is this your-- cutting words okay all right well it rolled a 21 to hit for cutting words you roll a d10 and subtract that from the attack roll right so 20 does that hit all right so (off-key horn noise ping) (laughter) you take 20 points of bludgeoning damage from the first strike and your shawm is bent and (weak horn noise) not quite-- you'll probably have to buy a new one or get that repaired you almost lost a tooth in the process as you're like (groans) from the impact you pull back and you can feel already the pulsing of the blood from the veins that have burst it brings up its club one more time (roars) that is going to be a 13 this time as it brings its club up you see the arc and you-- (whoosh) the swing is completely out of your view (laughter) so that's seven points of slashing damage from the first one and then the critical ooh nice and a six on that one so that's 12 14 points of slashing damage from the other guy so both of the guards rush up one of them misses entirely one jams the blade to the hilt in the middle of its body and pulls out the last one actually jumps up onto its back and takes the sword and slams it into its spine and drags it down a really decent wound for anything not this big on this size it's a little gash still but it left a nice sizable wound and it opens up and this horrible smell comes reeking out the guy almost vomits as he backs up just (groans) the rot escaping from the wound that ends their turn pike you're up yeah you'll have to use those to get up to him all right actually the open wound would be around here but with sprinter's boots you can get there just fine yeah so you actually get around all right and you're technically flanking with grog so you have advantage on these attacks so go for it roll to attack twice and take the higher of the two i know you've been filming for a while okay that's the higher of the two yeah that definitely hits roll for the second attack because you can use your bonus action to strike because you're a war cleric a total of nine add your attack bonus next to your weapon on your character sheet it's okay you're out of practice girl it's all good you've been too busy being in someone's blindspot 17 again there you go both hit go ahead and roll the damage for the mace plus if i recall 1d6 plus three yep you also have a mace of disruption don't you what was the effect on that one do you have the item with you you also add an additional 1d8 damage to the first strike it's not going to make that it didn't make that (laughter) awesome all right so you're rolling 1d6 plus three plus another 1d8 and how much did you say for that okay so 3d6 plus three and then an additional 1d8 for each strike undead man 3d6 plus three plus an additional 1d8 radiant damage for both attacks yeah undead not for damage that was just to hit 23 on the first hit yeah all right the mace of disruption actually has a different effect it's not about a frightened thing if it has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage it has to make a dc 15 wisdom saving throw which it fails so as you rush up along the side of it your sprinter's boots carrying you this blur of divine gnomish energy you see through her somewhat shimmering radiant form the hair itself glistens against the rain it almost doesn't even touch somehow immaculate in the middle of combat you find it slow motion in your head and for that brief moment you remember how much it hurt to see her go and how happy you are to have her here however you in the middle of your battle trance pike rush up shield ahead you take the mace and seeing the open wound slam the mace in there once (wham) as you hit the actual undead flesh burns away from the impact leaving this ashy swath of missing flesh in its body the creature gives out this weird gurgly bellow (roar) using that moment as it rears back how do you want to do this (cheering) the magical power of this is essentially destroying the creature so describe this however you want to in your radiant cleric form okay as he reaches back you see this foothold on its knee as it's trying to keep itself aloft you leap up using your sprinter's boots onto one of its knees jump in the air dropping your shield and two hands on your mace you leap in the air slam it downward as the mace impacts on the front of its chest there's this brief moment of pause as it cracks into its flesh its head looks down at you and there's a burst of divine energy as his entire torso (explosion) rips open what would be organs within that exposed however are all also turned to ash as the body (death rattle) dissipates and disintegrates falling into a puddle of liquid messy muddy ash and bits and pieces of remaining giant there as pike lands on the ground 3-point landing mace in one hand walks over and picks up her shield and looks over her shoulder at grog and scanlan yeah (laughter) the three soldiers who are now there looking dumbfounded at this moment step forward and-- you look like fighters except you have this glowing divine entity amongst the three of you he steps forward if i might ask who are you and how did you do that you're with the de rolos sam and you're not there you're with the de rolos then let it be done thank you for the save we're going to gather our wounded and prepare for the next attack all right men come and the three of them rush off they gather up a few of their friends who are further down the road all groaning and wounded getting up and putting their arms over their friends' necks gathering the dead and pulling them off the middle of the road you notice as they're pulling them off the road each one of their dead friends they're actually pulling out torches and lighting fire to their corpses so what are you guys doing roll perception only during a short rest 13 not in this weather not in this city nope whitestone not really a beret kind of people like a sock sure there's also no laundry left out during the middle of a rainstorm it could be unfortunately at this moment no you are unable to see any sort of a beret or could-be-fashioned-into-a-beret-type clothing piece oh grog's getting bold all right so as you guys go rushing towards the western side of the city to meet up with the rest of the group the rest of you rushing past the center of the town square you go running through the rain to the far side you can now see the form that you originally saw vax one of these giants has been pushed back as you get all the way to the eastern side you're actually outside the city now you're pushing into the forest on the outskirts on the raised hill amongst this part of the town just outside the wall there is the temple of pelor in the center of the large graveyard you can see that this zombie giant has been pushed back you can just barely see the crest of him currently slamming some sort of large metallic weapon around right over the treeline as you approach the outside gate of the graveyard itself okay what's the range on hunter's mark 90 feet you're probably going to have to get a little bit closer okay good to know you guys all going stealth right now or are you all rushing in okay the gates are slammed open part of the metal's bent inward like whatever was pushing the giant back at this point had slammed through the gate you feel pretty stealthy all right so as you guys all rush into the center here looking about you can see this hefty graveyard that you visited about two days ago all of the graves are open all of them are excavated and open and you're starting to see where they're pulling a lot of these undead from however many of them being armored and armed means it wasn't a direct transition they were probably pulled from here and given weapons elsewhere but that's the first thought that catches your attention as you rush in here rain pouring down the clapping of thunder in the distance you can see there are six of these soldiers that are currently hacking away at this one giant that's being pushed up towards the edge of the temple right now it looks like it's cornered but it's lashing out like a wild animal roll initiative folks you can now yes along the side this way okay so you'll be over here oh (chuckles) all right so 20 to 25 anybody 20 to 15 that brings us to-- keyleth what did you get all right the image of this whole thing-- even though it looks like it's currently surrounded its giant form barely damaged at this point is still a very ominous thing that strikes a bit of fear in your heart causing you to hold back on your initial assault and also worrying about not knowing how the rest of your party is doing percy you start this off right now okay actually from this view you can see it's actually a very large morningstar all right 16 does hit all right so as you get down to the ground (gunshot blast) the echoing explosive shot fired from the bad news slams up as it lifts its morningstar in the air two of its fingers get blown off its hand and the morningstar tumbles (boof) onto the ground nearly crushing one of the guards nearby who barely manages to sidestep as it (boof boof) lands on its side right outside the temple of pelor well done yep reload with your second attack all right 15 hits okay what's the dc on it yeah so 18 all right it rolled a 16 and has a plus four modifier on constitution so it makes the save taliesin and sorry yeah (explosion) the blast took a chunk of its physical form splatters against the side of the temple that ending your turn it having no hand at its disposal it glances over with this slow turning head (groans) reaches over and grabs a big piece of the stone rubble that was destroyed from the corner of the temple picks it up over its head (grunts) and lobs it at you across the way (whoosh whoosh whoosh) that's going to be a 21 to hit that hits you take 28 points of bludgeoning damage and have to make a strength saving throw yep so it slams into you and knocks you off your feet prone from the sheer impact it rests on part of your arm and you have to (grunts) work hard to push it off that will end its turn 28 28 points of bludgeoning damage that ends its go vax you're up okay vex okay go for it roll for two attacks both 24s both hit yeah roll damage for each 2d6 on top of that 37 points of damage (arrows flying and landing) it slams into the knee itself pushing out the kneecap a little bit from the side of its softened flesh the other one (boof) sticks and disappears into its torso you don't even see the impact it pushes through the flesh and vanishes into its very large-- okay we'll say for the piece of impact here okay roll a strength check this is control over your strength on this one 21 what did you roll laura and what's your strength 17 i was going to say you have minus two strength i know that it's okay that's still enough gauging pulling back on what little bit of focus you have as far as restraining you're good at aim restraining is something you have difficulty with but you release the arrow hitting at a very defined mark shattering part of its rib there in the front and the arrow sticking out by about a good six inches or so you are not did you use your boots of haste at the end of last session i feel like you used it you could use a bonus action to dash don't forget as a rogue okay so you run up planting a foot on its thigh leap in the air grab onto the arrow that vex left in its chest whip upward and while you're in the air towards its face go ahead and make your attack you only get one attack because you used your bonus action to dash you do have advantage on this if you wish to roll you technically have him flanked with the other guy that hits definitely 23 points of damage all righty so as you leap into the air you bring the blade slam into the center of its face over one of the eyebrows it slams into the skull and using your weight you tear down dragging the blade across its face the bone is brittle underneath its flesh and it hacks part of its face open the bone and teeth immediately become visible its jaw clenches and actually clamps onto your blade as it reaches the bottom of its face and you catch yourself there for a second the horrible scent of its rotting flesh hitting your body you manage to take your foot up push off pulling the blade out from under its toothy grasp and you land on the ground right beside it big old jagged gash in the side of its face cool all right now the rest of the guards are going to go oh natural 20 these are the resistance members 21 points of damage for the non-criticals so all the guards now seeing this opening and these sudden heroes rushing in to attack it use this opening some have shortswords some have spears they start jamming them into its sides beginning to take chunks out of it and basically scraping away its form its mass that is keeping it aloft through this necromantic enchantment that ends their turn keyleth you're up landed beside him now after he pulled the blade out of its face correct that'll put you just at 30 feet yeah you can barely see vax vax is hard to see period but you can barely see vax at this point okay he's currently up against the edge of the temple yes just so you're aware heat metal does 2d8 damage to him for holding onto it it doesn't do additional damage okay just letting you know for future reference so vax you immediately take 2d8 points of fire damage and you have to make a constitution saving throw vs her dc or you drop both of your daggers make a constitution saving throw what's the dc on your spells both daggers just drop to the ground as they both slam into the mud (sizzling sound) she's not even watching she's just concentrating on it and then with your bonus action okay so you open your eyes so you're going to restrain him with a grasping vine yeah make a dexterity saving throw or be pulled it doesn't restrain it just pulls them towards the vine since he's already against the wall you can pull him away or toward read the spells the information's right there because of his-- sure all right he fails on the dc that's a total of ten we'll say for the time being he is considered grappled you did something you're welcome you finish concentrating you release the grasping vine it pulls a little hard to the ground you see its form go (groans) it doesn't look very happy and you see vax going (gasps) there are these little cylinders of steam rising up from the ground where his daggers are currently (sizzling noise) that ends your turn we're back to the top of the round percy you're up okay so you're prone you're prone the boulder knocked you prone you can you get up and use half of your movement you're reloading and then shooting 15 does hit all righty okay so this is the headshot okay you've already used your action surge for the day oh it is a short rest yeah go for it all right his ac is eight by the way it's a big heaping pile of hit points it's not hard to hit you've attacked it enough that you gather it's pretty easy to hit all righty go for it all right now the giant pieces missing out of its body looks around and it reaches down and grabs-- yeah it's going to use one of its attacks and grab the morningstar and with its second act it's going to swing over towards you vax you just slammed into its face with the dagger yes an 11 and a one grappling just prevents movement but yeah he goes in and swings wide and you just duck out of the way dodge off to the side (boosh) it slams and gets stuck in the mud and there's a (sucking noise) horrible sucking sound as it has to pull it out of the ground with all of its might that ends its turn this giant's in a bad place you're up it's currently kneeled forward just pulling its morningstar out of the mud okay you take 2d8 points of fire damage roll it keyleth you pick up the daggers take the damage lift them up to go in for the attack roll for the attack all right seven okay i'll allow it that's not usually how the spell works i'll allow it for this circumstance since you're taking the damage to do the attack i'll let it happen okay so as you're holding the daggers with the searing pain you reach up slash both daggers down into the front of its body and you drag across you can see its chest breaks open and it (groans) stumbles backward the air expiring from its throat (roars) it pushes up against it holding onto that shred of undeath that it currently has in its body not falling to your measly blows that ends your turn do you want to move at all you used a bonus action for your second attack yeah because you're not hasted all right go for it vex first strike will be the blazing bowstring okay all right hold on how do you want to do this (cheering) okay so as you release the arrow itself you can feel the warmth licking the side of your face as the arrow heats up release it it shoots through the air like a tracer dart just (arrow whizzing) the giant which is currently reaching back-- it has a palm out like it's going to try to palm vax after the attack as it reaches up (groans) it just (arrow whizzing) into the back of the eye and as it sinks inside its head (thud) there's this dull thud sound like the fire burst on the inside of its head its other eye (explosion) plumps out and hangs out the side as fire darts out from that open socket its jaw goes slack and it begins to lurch forward towards you and the guy next to it both of you guys step back out of the way as it (moans thuds) onto the muddy ground in front of you everyone takes a breath for a second yes you see him currently putting out his hands okay what level level two okay so 2d8 plus six so you heal 12 hit points the guards who currently are checking to make sure it's dead they're stabbing its body okay you notice they look like guards at first glance because the armor they're wearing is the same type of armor that the guards you've encountered here wear but they're all underneath the armor wearing rags farmer's clothing whatever's available it's still uniform armor and weapon design to anyone who's worked in whitestone you don't know because you're not there (laughs) thank you thank you for coming and helping that got a little hairy there for a minute we didn't lose any of our men thankfully and that's thanks to you he reaches up for a second and wipes this black blood stuck to his chin from the fight so what's next all right what time all right men dawn dawn it is sheathes his weapon the other men stand up and one of them makes one final stab into the body of the zombie like yeah take that they begin to walk back towards town one of them goes pelor right three of them run back to the doorway of the temple and they all stop for a second and give a silent prayer to themselves and then join the rest of their crew as they go walking back towards the city right now it's hard to tell it's about two hours past sunset make an investigation check glancing about you notice that the coffins are still there at the bottom but they're all open the lids are off and they're empty entirely whatever body is gone best you can glance about the most that you can find most of them are just laid to rest one of them seems to be laid to rest with what looks to be a nice ornamental dagger of some kind that's left to their side there actually is an undercroft in your castle so you leap down into the grave from what you can see from up there it just looks like a fairly nice dagger it has a little like gold sheen to it and looks like there's gems encrusted in it from this distance so you leap down into the grave drop your feet hitting against the wooden bottom of the coffin smells musty and it's been rained in heavily so it's not as bad as it could be it looks to be a pretty dagger you reach for it and pick it up and look at it it's lightweight it's ornamental it's not actually more of a functional-- go for it go for it natural 20 okay take a look at it there doesn't appear to be enough of a rune structure even on this dagger to give it like a formal enchantment it looks ritualistic and ornamental it's probably worth a pretty penny but it is not a-- climb back up out of the grave go ahead and make a wisdom check just roll a d20 add your six to it yep 12 looking over the body this entity and anything that would be functional on the stone giant's body is far rotted and necrosis has taken hold on a lot of the body parts nothing here would be of use in any way shape or form plus stone giants don't really have any magical components to their body they're just larger humanoids what small trophies you could take from it you could sell here and there for a little bit of change are also rotted and corroded by its undead form that it wouldn't be worth it (laughs) this is true all right so what's the plan all right so you guys-- okay as you pull the dust out of your pouch you look at it and it's turned to just sand it seems that the dust of tracelessness is effective when only pulled and used directly out of its pouch-- if taken out remotely and left on its own for a while it becomes magically inert yes this is one of those few circumstances where percy's almost more helpful than you are as far as making your way through the two of you together very helpful you guys have been making your way through the city making westward to meet up with the rest of the party against the wall on the western side of whitestone and with that we're going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom break bring in some snacks so hang tight guys we'll be back here in just a minute welcome back everyone so picking up where we left off eventually the longest-traveling group would be the one that went all the way to the zenith the temple of pelor eventually the rain still heavily coming down you guys keeping warm and out of the way to the far far western wall kind of keeping behind a bush the rest of the party arrives the gnomes and goliath barbarian waiting for you as you approach (laughter) so the rest of you guys gather what are you doing what's your plan okay (laughs) you go and hug her and it's one of those things where because her form it feels like you're grabbing almost a warm energetic gelatin in a way like her form isn't purely physical and there is this hot wind that wraps around her and her hair is drifting a little bit there's something her physical form is very strange here you had received a letter from allura from emon if you recall her form shimmers for a second almost like the energy that keeps her corporeal in this location for a moment flickers and then she is restored to her form you get the sense that-- that she's not actually physically here this divine projection is a channeling of sarenrae's power keeping her here for the moment that really terrible one that doesn't work well okay are you guys coasting within the city's walls or are you moving outside of the city's walls okay so you find your way a little bit southward-- stealthing to make your way outside of the city into the forest surrounding the outskirts of whitestone make a stealth check guys this is without the plus ten bonus because you don't have any more spells grog okay you rolled a ten okay all right as you guys move into the forest the boughs of the trees do help offset some of the rain but there is still some rain making it through and there is a heavy drip through the leaves you start pushing through you make your way out i'd say a good five minutes to the west of the city before you start heading northward both percy and vex taking lead on this you being the natural stalker you knowing these lands quite well as percy presses along coughing and keeping his eyes peeled you press on for about 30 minutes to the north the rain begins to subside a little bit and you can hear the occasional (cracking noise) sound of these strange growling cat-like noises you know that some of the indigenous creatures of the sierras-- you've heard this before it's nothing terribly dangerous they're just natural cat-like creatures that live in the trees ocelot-like they're indigenous to this region that's them communicating it's initially off-setting but you keep pushing forward i would have both of you guys make survival checks that's true and you would have advantage actually because you know this area 14 okay the two of you working together on this-- it takes you an hour or so before you eventually get further enough north and out of the outskirts of whitestone where you begin to see the rising platform the small central forest mesa that the castle whitestone is built upon you can see through the heavy cloud cover what little bit of torch light is visible from some of the castle interior in the distance it's this ominous dark shape outlined against the cloud cover above you okay did you get that ashley so pressing on eventually catching the edge of that mountain that to you is the inclination you know this area very well spending most of your time living around this castle you gesture for the rest of the group to follow you up towards the edge of this central mountain platform that the castle's upon eventually coasting along the side-- i want you to make an investigation check percy 16 okay pushing forward you spend a good 20 minutes walking back and forth you're pretty sure that this is where the entrance is and looking along this area you make your way to the northern side of this mountain no entrance seems to be appearing to you there's no opening there's no doorway it was a cavern exit that was loosely hidden by a series of bushes that were clustered around it okay about ten minutes of you guys searching as you travel southward among this okay you guys watch along the wall and nothing seems to be catching your eye you notice that there's a portion of the mountainside that is looser rock everything here is solid long-eroded through weather and time there is one section that appears to have more of a crumbly loose rock that forms the lower portion of the wall okay make an athletics check 18 okay you go over and start pulling the rocks away a lot of the ones at the very surface are pretty small and you're pushing them aside and rolling off eventually you start getting to the base of this area and you can see now there are a cluster of bushes that have long died and are crushed under these rocks this would be similar to the placement of where the bushes were that originally obscured the crawlspace that led into this tunnel sure go for it 21 inspecting this the pattern in which it fell was very localized which leads you to believe-- yeah this was blasted or was intentionally done to demolish this exit as opposed to a natural fall at this point in time you've pulled through a few of the larger rocks and you roll them over and you do reveal a small tunnel about 15 minutes of pushing this stuff out of the way before you eventually find it and it's probably a good ten feet inward it's tight but you can start moving in there okay you make your way into this lower tunnel a bit sharp in there black as night no light source the ground itself is very dry which is a nice change from the rather wet exterior awaiting you outside it generally smells musty and seems disused and very dark okay you take the dagger with the flickering light along the blade it lights up the area the tunnel widens up to roughly eight to ten feet wide and seems to curl forward before disappearing around a gradual edge about 50 feet ahead of you it's about six feet tall so the taller of you folk are going to have to crouch in but it's about six feet tall about eight to ten feet wide and that continues to curl deeper in towards the mountain yeah no more than maybe five feet off this mountain line the forest grows immediately dense if you crawl inside to look as you guys all may your way inside glancing about-- make an investigation check okay make a sleight-of-hand check okay yeah there's been no footsteps in here for quite some time as she's saying this you look over and scanlan almost looks at you directly and goes like-- he grabs your wrist and stops you dagger's retrieved you're in the tunnel right now you can move a few there's no boulders quite large enough to fully close it off you can do it it will take you a little bit of time but you can do it okay the tunnel continues and curves out of sight about 50 feet in okay let's see how long that lasts for yeah it lasts for eight hours yes you can all right so as you guys are having this conversation pike grabs her holy symbol for a second closes her eyes and focuses and the energy around her that slightly drifting ethereal divine energy seems to shift away from her for a second and then coalesce into what looks like a floating ghostly armored entity that apparates in the air beside her her form once again becomes whole and she looks towards it and gives it a nod and the armored entity seems to acknowledge with a strange head nod and then turns towards the inner side of the tunnel and begins patrolling a small section of the tunnel on its own you can make a medicine check on him you haven't made one 17 okay you take a moment to inspect percy looking at his features checking his pulse and generally getting a sense of his life force in general his eyes are sunken his jowls are shadowed from what you recall of percy he was always a seemingly-healthy if on the thin and pale side individual doubly more so than you've ever seen him there is an unrest to his energy and there is no physical natural illness or discernible disease but there is something unsettling about his presence that you've never sensed before you can try it lesser or greater restoration yeah if you want to so what are you casting lesser or greater restoration okay so pike reaches up you grab his face again and you close your eyes and concentrate her hands begin to glow with an extremely bright vibrance even moreso than her gently luminescent form right now it's almost like there's a blowtorch of radiant energy right around his jaw the rest of her form almost seems to put so much energy into it that her legs begin to dissipate and vanish almost like she's putting all of her energy into this moment the rest of her body fading into the grasp you feel this warmth wash through your entire body and for a brief moment for the first time in a number of weeks there's a moment of serenity to you your eyes instinctually close and for a second you feel like you're standing next to pike in a void of darkness as that warmth hits pike you sense something there you sense a seed of darkness there's something in him that you can almost reach out and grasp and in that imaginative space you do you thrust your hand out and grab onto it and it's taut and it's fighting but you pull and wrest it forth and as you do you feel it burn and dissipate at which point both of you guys open your eyes breathe in succession with each other the energy fades from your hands and your form goes back to its full radiant physicality you can remove a corruption point from yourself yes he's still looking a little sickly but definitely improved no you just lose a corruption point the cough is still there roll a stealth check you have no idea what a corruption point is but you removed some point of corruption in his body almost like a small seed of sentient tumor you removed from him it's a compounding thing yeah they're not specific you don't know you have no idea yeah how dare you no it's fine while this is happening vax has vanished ahead into the tunnel on his own you guys look around and realize that he's nowhere to be seen okay vax pushing ahead thankfully in the darkness you have a little bit of vision limited as it is make a perception check as you turn around the corner you lose the light source okay you continue around the edge and the tunnel evens out for a bit and then goes straight and then curves again to the left following that it curves again to the right you can keep going or you can head back you've traversed about 60 or 70 feet in this tunnel you keep pushing towards this tunnel and turn to the right you travel a bit further forward and as the tunnel makes another sharp right turn you see all of a sudden where the dirt stops and there is solid smooth stonework a broken portion of what looks like the back side of a wall of some kind you see nothing beyond it it looks like there is a piece of stone something pressed against it and looks like some other things are stacked basically covering this entrance make a perception check 21 you take a minute close your eyes and take in all audio you can stillness quiet nothing it's already sealed grog already sealed it yeah he pulled rocks into it and closed the exit make a sleight-of-hand check grog what's your passive perception okay okay as you step away there's a (snort) as your nostrils are stopped up now and the airflow is impeded partially from the way you're used to you begin breathing heavily through the mouth in reaction yeah one beans you in the side of the temple is there just keeping ever vigil for the next eight hours are you guys taking shifts or are you leaving it to the guardian roll a sleight-of-hand check grog roll a perception check just for the hell of it deftly blended in with the tattoos unless those who are aware there are strange new series of markings across grog's face that he may not notice for quite some time oh how detailed you don't know (laughs) oh all right you guys go to sleep you look back over at keyleth and she's asleep are you going to sleep at all you stay up for the two hours there doesn't seem to be much incident whatsoever there's that gentle draft coming through from some of the cracks in the stones that were set up to block the entryway it was not a perfect hole of course just enough to not arouse suspicion there is cold air seeping through you can hear the rain muffled in the distance and there's a little bit of a leak coming through from where the stones were set up to block the entrance eventually sleep comes to you it is a strange lulling sound everyone sleeps relatively comfortably for being in the middle of a stone tunnel you have dreams again dreams images flashes flashes of your family hanging from the sun tree it never happened but your mind creates the image for you you see flashes of your sister screaming out to you as the arrows take her in the chest you see a flash of what looks like a skull a skull face the skull brings itself to where you focus on one of its ocular sockets and blood begins to pour from the socket flash to black a familiar voice rings out again do not forget our deal cold morning air comes to you as you all slowly come to consciousness uncomfortable kinks in your back it's not the best place to sleep but the bare minimum of the long rest is achieved throughout the evening as you all eventually come to and check and make sure everyone's okay you awake a little unnerved pike is just waking up she's still there her image you can see in her sleeping state is diminished when she comes to consciousness it almost flares up again her presence here is purely a force of will and that connection is a very tenuous one i would like everyone to make a constitution check five all righty the dc on this is not as high everyone but keyleth passed keyleth as you wake up there's a general cold sensation within your body and you feel like there's really no way to keep warm no matter how hard you try and bundle up you even use a bit of druidcraft to create a bit of sparkling warm fire that you use to keep your hands set and the cold doesn't seem to go away okay your hands are shaking unnaturally and there's a general chatter to your teeth you have disadvantage on any dexterity ability checks skill checks wouldn't affect attacks i will say it doesn't really affect initiative per se but if you were to try to do any delicate handwork you would have disadvantage you've gained a modicum of experience while you were away from the party just at a slower rate so you are at a lower level than the rest of the party not by a terrible amount but you'd be level 11 by now probably clerics do have access to heroes' feast correct so you would have one 6th-level spell if you wanted to you could prepare that as your prepared 6th-level spell for the day that is your choice pike a sigil (laughs) yeah true so heroes' feast heal you've got to pick one all right so mark off your other thousand gold chalice that you had purchased beforehand i think you're out now aren't you she has one more it's being used right now she'd purchased two before you left i would think probably not you hand over the chalice to pike pike you take the chalice and you set it down before you you mark a symbol in the dirt in the center of this tunnel in the shape of a giant rectangular table you take your holy symbol remove it from your neck and thrust it into the ground at the head of the table with that dust kicks up as seemingly out of nowhere this giant table and feast just (fwoosh) rises no but holy shit it's delicious it is very good benches around and available you all sit around it and dig into the most delightful mid-tunnel cold sub-castle breakfast you've ever had so you guys all for the next 24 hours have advantage on wisdom saving throws and i believe it's 2d6 is that what it was marisha i'll look it up right here heroes' feast nope 2d10 everyone roll 2d10 and add that temporary hit points to your hp value that includes you too pike so roll 2d10 and that's temporary hit points on top of your regular hit points meaning once those go away they cannot be healed back yep yep you're immune to poison and you get advantage on all wisdom saving throws heroes' feast motherfucker immune to fear and poison oh such a good spell very expensive but damn if it hasn't been clutch it is not raining currently the sky is still cloudy and dark yeah okay so with grog's help you move some of the rocks out of the way you get a visual of the sky you lean out focus cast your skywrite spell-- mark that spell off-- and as you coalesce the clouds to be extremely dark and to form the de rolo crest symbol in the sky as that happens you begin to see about two minutes later little beacon lights begin to ignite across the city lanterns and torches being lit it looks like as it is probably an hour past dawn that the surviving remainder of the whitestone rebellion is raring itself to attack you may raise your glass and drink if you'd like ashley there we go (laughs) as you guys finish your drink the heroes' feast slowly sinks back into the dirt leaving the empty tunnel before you the slight cold sound of drifting wind through the now freshly barricaded rock exit of the secret passageway begins to reach your ears what do you wish to do okay using the veritable torchlight from keyleth's burning hands you guys press down the hallway vax taking point eventually you get to the end of the hallway there's a portion of the stone wall that has been chiseled out it's not very smooth it's rough in the way it was constructed but there is definitely about a foot-thick wall that would go to the right and left of you in the dirt that has been chiseled and broken through to reveal this passageway that you guys are traversing immediately on the other side of this opening now that you have a better look at it it looks to be some sort of stone sculpture or statue of some kind bless you you do this statue is one of the large things used to hide this exit and it is normally shoved out of the way there are a few other boxes immediately adjacent to it and from what little bit you can glance past it it looks like this section is used for storage of some kind and is filled with whatever random crates and whatever needed to be placed down here to keep it out of the way sure there you go as you step up and inspect the back of the statue the stonework is very well done and there is a very very faint magical essence to this statue it's so miniscule and the only reason you're able to pick it up is you're so fine-tuned to seeking out that presence it doesn't have a specific form it doesn't have a specific school of magic applied to it it just has a general faint magical aura it's carved out of the white stone correct it doesn't appear to have any sort of strong magical presence for a specific purpose you don't think so okay it's all pressed against the wall the widest gap is about that wide you're going to have to push or shove things out of the way all the crates are pushed up against it blocking the whole exit make a strength check natural one grog cracks his fingers and grins stepping up goes to push the statue and then pop something in your lower back gives and (groans) the air escapes your lungs and it's been a long time since this injury has crept up but you threw your back out a little trinket who at this point in time by the way guys takes up a large portion of the tunnel-- pushes past you guys and turns around and puts his rump against it and starts backing up into it (moans) go ahead and roll a d20 add two to the roll yeah (laughing) perpetually defeated by passageways and entrances all right everyone but grog can help in this grog you're out for this one yeah adding your strength as you give it a good solid try the force of you guys combined there is just a lot of weight pressed up against this statue with the crates on the other side this storage room is very full and you find vox machina for all of its journeys battles victories and celebratory events bested by a room of clutter pike did you want to give it a shot okay pike roll a d20 and add your strength modifier plus your strength modifier all right as you guys all take a moment to have this discussion pike steps forward her hair drifting behind her buoyant in the air she steps up and centers herself sets her shield to the side puts her mace down closes her eyes puts her hands on the statue and just (grunts) begins to shove and push as she does you guys hear (stone scraping noise) the crates begin to push and move out of the way and she pushes the statue a good six feet ahead pushing some of it out of the way leaving a little bit of opening and a visual walkway into this basement area trinket gives a (grumpy grunt) trinket is really good at massages trinket begins going (grunts) stepping on you (cracking) and you hear-- i'm going to have you roll a stealth check-- with disadvantage because of grog's moaning at the massage (laughs) okay all right you disappear in it's very dark in here there's one sconce that appears to be giving a bit of flickering light across the way as you step out of this chamber into what looks to be two paths that go to the right and the left and then curve and disappear right across from you appears to be a central room or space you can make a little bit of visual around you but best you can see is there are a series of bars like cells arranged across some of the walls here you appear to have stumbled upon the subterranean whitestone dungeon or prison correct here this will be a good perspective for you that's where you guys came through and see this path here and here and there are cells on this side oh you're in the storage room make an investigation check okay there's a lot of broken building materials 18 okay looking around you see there's work materials there's pickaxes there's crowbars there's things that are used in various tool-based means throughout the uses of a castle most of them are for grounds repair and things like that nothing particularly interests you there are a few crates that have residual whitestone in them but it appears that most of it has been used or taken elsewhere like dust and small rocks here and there sure okay you seeing both of those paths-- yeah around the way to your left you see that's the source of a little bit of sconce torchlight okay as you're moving forward you hear behind you the sound of crates shifting lids moving because searching through a room of large clutter and crates makes noise you take a few steps and that happens and you're like and you hear echoing from around a corner a voice go hello is someone there this really crackly dry voice hello (laughter) from what you can tell no the only dim light is coming from around that corner from the source of where that sound seemed to come right nothing immediately in your visual perspective if you go all the way to the edge you can look past the corner if you want okay perception check okay listening for a second you hear what sounds like some shifting like a body shifting over some sort of low crumbling sounds almost like grasses or hay or some sort of soft bedding is being shifted a little bit you hear a clink of metal of some kind you're not sure quite what the source is and a couple of other small shifting and grinding sounds of metal comes to a halt very much so this is where you woke up where cassandra pulled you-- you right now are staring off into space because you recall the last time you were here you woke up in a cell next to a cell that contained a pile of bodies of previously related members of your family before cassandra ushered you out okay so as you guys are having this conversation percy just starts walking-- okay everyone who wishes to be stealthy can be stealthy okay everyone roll stealth we'll keep with your consistent roll currently okay with plus ten all right only it would be like (whoosh) what'd you get grog okay you guys all move as a group forward pike what'd you get yeah roll your stealth girl plus ten to it no you guys push down the left hallway or the right one the cell that would've been yours would be kind of on the opposite side of the room from you on the other side the fastest way would be taking the left path towards the light source okay so you guys head that direction kind of following percy-- yeah you move towards the light you guys turn around the corner and look not in the cell you were in but across the way because there are six cells three on each side of the hallway facing each other and on the far cell on the outside-wall side of it you see there's a torch sconce that is lit and just slowly crackling it's almost reached ember period like it's about to be changed out probably and inside you see sitting just squat on the ground in a cell by herself this woman facing away back up against the bars and that's all you can see she's facing away from you guys her back is up against the bars she's kinda-- turns her head and looks over and it's the first time you see her face much older woman probably in her early seventies or so but seventies living in a not very-- seventy years in a hard life so very deep sunken wrinkles the skin is very weathered her hair is mostly whitish-gray with a little bit of you can see remaining reds and browns in it at some point she might've had much brighter-colored hair her clothing is pretty ragged and she leans over and looks to you guys squinting her eyes in the darkness all right who is this she's still kind of looking out into the darkness she can't see you guys really she just hears your voices who are you she's being very guarded right now and very spooked i'm gloria gloria cyn how'd you find your way in here she looks very confused at you are you friend or foe do you work with the briarwoods do all of you step forward at this point or is it just you a bear who is that okay roll insight 24 okay i mean she's in a cell in a dungeon and looks to be fairly spooked but also guarded not much to read beyond the fact that she's an old woman in a dungeon i mean she's definitely staying guarded in the circumstance but you're not picking up any sort of strange animosity and all these voices are coming out of the darkness she's like i came up from dryna to ask why the waters are growing brackish fish float downstream dead and taste of ash these days delilah laughed and threw me in here saying i'm a fair better offering than a fisherman that's the last i know i've been here for over a week they brought me into the main grand throne chamber to speak with the lord and lady they ushered me through the halls and we waited about an hour for them to arrive apparently they were busy elsewhere there was a brief discussion they laughed at me and threw me in here there were many guards i'd heard of dark things happening in this castle but when i was escorted through i saw things in the courtyard shambling things things that should not be alive tens dozens i did not feel right at that moment and then well my fate was brought into this terrible cell she kind of looks about every now and then every day or so they bring enough to subsist on do you have the detect magic spell i mean what are you-- arcana's more inspecting a close area to see if there is the nature of an arcane enchantment or something on it you don't actually like sense it what are you doing keyleth she grabs them as soon as they come through the cell and grasps them to herself you're very kind i have not seen or heard anyone else occasional wails soft mournful moans but i stay quiet i stay very still would you please let me out if there is war then that's the time to leave when there is distraction i can run i made it up here north didn't i i've lived in these lands for quite some time i know how to survive please please don't leave me i don't know what's going on you can check the cell door at least take the fate into my own hands i don't mean any wrong here but i have no reason to really trust you either how can i show my trust how can i-- i can be quiet do not leave me here to waste and die what if you don't succeed what if you fall in whatever folly you're making away into this castle for and i waste away down here myself please please you're the only one who's out of the light now right but everyone else is still in the shadow all these voices coming at her okay she steps a little closer to you as you're holding the whip out and she grabs your hand with her left hand and kind of pulls it in and goes please don't leave me here i can fend for my own just don't leave me here make an intimidation check she shrinks back she still hasn't looked away from you and she kind of looks at you for a second and (heavy sigh) sits down frustrated at the bottom of the cell and just then go leave me useless anything else you want to do you skitter around the corner go ahead and make a perception check okay looking about the cells they all appear to be empty you do catch a couple of rats skittering through some of the brush nothing that really is the source of that scraping metal sound you go around the way and there's another set of cells nobody else in the other cells you heard it echoing around the other hallway so it could be amorphously from the same source that she came from or near the cell since you left the symbol up there 20 minutes yeah there is past her cells a-- now that you've been through this whole thing you can see now-- she's in this cell over here you've come around here and you can see there are two cells this way a cell this way and then these sets of cells there is a stairway that curves upward-- this one right there she brought it to her but she didn't eat it immediately no no okay you go through every cell there is nobody living in them you do see a few of the cells have long-decomposed corpses piles of bones mostly picked clean by the rats or whatever creatures live in here but from your best knowledge of decomposition through your experiences nothing fresher than like the past year maybe (laughs) okay she goes i was fed naught but this morning i have to make this last no but if you eat it all at once you have nothing to keep you over until the next time she gives you a strange look takes some of the rations and breaks it off it's not the finest of stone fish but it'll do why are you so spiteful giant man could i ask what for could i ask what for unfortunately your form here is incorporeal there is no blood flow from your current body back in vasselheim there is yes okay what's wrong with you she turns her head curiously and looks disgusted and disturbed by this display very confused i know not which madness has taken you please please i implore you just open these gates let me fare for my own fate she you you please okay vax walks towards the stairs the rest of you guys okay as you're going for the lock she rushes up and helps you with it and is holding like yes yes please just like that all right you turn it this way you don't have the proper tools for this-- foolish girl make a perception check 26 when she went up and grabbed the lock with you her hands grabbed the lock you only felt one hand you're not there the worst but anyway we are going to leave it there-- (shouting) so now whitestone castle has been infiltrated the real path to the seeming end is on we will
