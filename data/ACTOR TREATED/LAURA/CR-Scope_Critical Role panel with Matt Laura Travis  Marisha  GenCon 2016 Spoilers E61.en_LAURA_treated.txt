brunch i would make quiches for us i've always wanted cameras following me around see that actually sounds more interesting if they follow me and travis home they would get us laying on our carpet playing with charlie i think that scanlan should hawk all of that stuff it's on-brand for him gilmore's glorious granola you can fix people's limbs wait did you have that when vax had no toes thank you audience i would want magic i want to be able to play with magic a little more although i know it's so freaking complicated that's why they have the book right fried chicken is that percy audience (gasps) should i come down there tell your sister i said thank you she made this out of a quarter i know right truncate oh yeah and you intimidated him right i think it also helps that the whole party we're all friends and we genuinely want to cheer each other on and encourage each other you know when grog has a fight with just one other person we genuinely are interested and are watching it and supporting him and you know scanlan turning into a rhinoceros we haven't said anything for an hour but it was one of the best games i remember playing because it was so much fun to watch him do all those crazy things as a master thank you thank you audience that's what we're all saying vex has been a name that i always go to whenever i'm playing any of my many video games i always like meanings i don't know why vex is one i already went to and so i'm going to be vex'ahlia and he's like fine i want to be vax'ildan as long as there's an apostrophe in it we're good me you'll get along with everybody i'm sure yeah audience whoa i'm allura audience don't let anybody else hold the carpet (laughter) like ever kima every time she gets taken out hey presents what is that the story of-- these

audience oh my gosh thank you so much audience thank you so much (applause) this is a really good vex shot of tequila (laughter) for yourself hey what's up audience most satisfying i don't know i don't know i mean scooping you up in the necklace was pretty cool like flying out and doing that yeah that was pretty cool audience and i guess you guys are all caught up on the show right i can say that out loud (laughter) that's true we did that was my first experience with anything like that and it all went to shit because everybody started hoarding all the secrets for themselves he was a gangster wasn't he the questions are the main thing ooh ursula hello audience yeah pretty much there's no game you can play now that you're not like oh hey matt hey again but what is surprising when you know somebody like i know matt or something and then i find out he was the voice and i had no idea that's always really fun to know somebody so well and they can still surprise you with these voices they have oh are we out of time i know i'm sorry audience oh i get burps all the time audience how do you deal with the nerves without alcohol oh i was so nervous so many people and usually once you get through that initial moment you'll have the nerves-- like whenever i would do musicals my voice would crack in my very first song because i was so nervous that i couldn't contain it that i would always crack and then after that crack was done i knew the rest of the show was going to be the bomb because i've gotten it out of my system and i was fine so you just lay into it get it out of the way and then everything else will be fine after that the box office is still open for the live show if anybody hasn't got tickets those are still available you can still come and see us tomorrow night and-- yeah ashley will be there (cheering) i know we're signing at 300 right during matt's panel sorry right during matt's panel
