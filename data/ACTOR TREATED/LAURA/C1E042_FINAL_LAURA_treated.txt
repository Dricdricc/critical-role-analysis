don't say that amazing we're making a cameo appearance in rat queens you guys i chose my friend's place which is an awesome very similar to taliesin's it's an awesome place for teenagers that are runaways or living on the streets it gives them a place that they can crash and really help get their stuff together yes continually oh they really do that is a really good place oh that was a good roll see i rolled five natural 20s before the show even started so it's all going to be terrible no i just have to figure out which ones i want to use that night i know and they're all useful no i've got six out here little strange we're off to a good start tonight guys well that's because we don't have anything because scanlan's troupe stole everything anyway insight check do we have anything that can sense people's alignment this is terrible what is happening i'm on it see this is why i shouldn't have this many dice because i don't know what to choose okay 21 21 gross yeah we need to get him settled in make sure he's all right yes actually garthok garthok is waiting for us down in those so we can go look at the clasp and talk to them and everything because he's told them we're on our way what why what did i do so many things you didn't think you could mention this all the times we've dealt with the clasp you didn't think it was worth mentioning that i almost died we've been down there to talk that's why you don't keep secrets in all experience let's be honest you need keyleth unless they don't know about the stone and the only one with the stone-- oh good because i would like to check in to vasselheim as well you know there is the slayer's take well there's metallic dragons well it's an organization made to hunt massive creatures isn't it yes but-- if everything else is under attack vasselheim is inevitable for a time that's good it's all over the water maybe the dragons haven't gone that far mostly to see you know come on don't say that millions it's very large any kind of advantage on that for growing up there or something eight great (laughs cynically) at least he's safe wow wow hit after hit after hit today taliesin can we relocate all of the refugees staying in our walls can we bring everyone through the sun tree keyleth how long does it stay open but we can at least get these people out an airship sounds wonderful percy but-- one dragon attacking it and it's down you keep thinking there wonderful we get the refugees out we go to whitestone we talk to them there we use the misty walk thingy and go to vasselheim talk to the slayer's take this is perfect problem-- do we need a ship right now darling i understand the joy in it -- believe a dragon wouldn't notice a giant airship flying out of the city we need to talk to the clasp first plus allura and drake are coming back we need to talk to them as well find out what's going on in westrunn and then we need to get everyone out i've got a plan here's a good plan this is a good plan though open up the tree send a bunch of refugees through shove them through as fast as possible percy you go with them we keep the stone you go through you talk to your sister you bamf back with the stone and then we talk to the clasp together no we're going to wait for you so can we get the refugees together well we comfort them and tell them all right obviously emon is not a safe place to be right now it's dangerous and we want to keep all of you as safe as possible we have a plan we're going to take those of you who need the most attention first and we're going to bring you to whitestone which is a city that has not been affected by dragons at all it has much need of people who can do an honest day's labor and you can earn a wage and find a living there for the time being and if at some point in time you want to come back to emon when all of this is done of course you're more than welcome to i'm rolling the gold one 20 in the winter then it could be a little chilly i like that we're sending to them to the place that's got the orb of death i said you might be able to see your breath percy-- stone to go through the-- oh okay well i assume as soon as we see it start to shrink we stop we cut off the line anybody with children how many children are here children with their moms go-- and families go first all right those people first oh good call okay so the injured can stay what okay so not the injured families first how about that as soon as we see it start to shrink i'll hold the people back so percy you're first everybody follow through so any families here families are you really respons-- i can tell when you're lying sir are you responsible for that child 26 child where's your parents do you have one oh dear okay then you would stay and wait for your family potentially that can move here we go that's good that's a good amount and then any other like single people that can move fast get ready to run people everybody comfortable with the plan you count in your head grog we put blankets on everybody right (whispering) eskil ryndarien more food for you guys which is a+ hey they work that's wonderful and you told them to make preparations in case something happens they need to start hiding food anything touching it disintegrates how would you turn it to a projectile-- are you okay keyleth one plus two plus one plus one well that's good because it cancels out any magic-- i've been down there several times without knowing that maybe i can become a member taking the tunnel we're taking the secret entrance-- garthok showed us the secret entrance he's waiting for us and having them prepare our way this could get bad oh that yes cool we're taking our secret tunnel into the city what else are we going to do how you doing there you okay in your pants cast pass without a trace on us aw it fell out of my hand i don't think it should count if it fell aw that's mean oh i get advantage trinket is staying with pike oh he's crying i'm crying as a dragon-favored enemy could i guesstimate what those winged creatures are that would hang out around dragons ah-ha the creature those are the things that attacked the airship i think you should turn it into a bunny keyleth turn it into a bunny 18 shit oh right right right there's so many things oh no why didn't i bring trinket i thought this was a stealthing mission oh i think grog was before me oh my gosh he's so strong from the last game you didn't rage yet is there anywhere i can stand that i get a good cone shape or am i all blocked in okay how high is the roof next to me could i acrobatics that shit up okay hold on oh 31 oh okay then i'm going to hunter's mark the magic user and i'm going to conjure barrage in a cone to get as many of those fucks as i can yeah sure sorry scanlan 3d8 it's not that much 16 and then an extra d6 on that guy an extra six yes it does come on scanlan can you dominate the beast no because he rolled a one remember yeah-- (laughs) keyleth shit (laughs) they're an army wow wow wow oh my god grog oh no scanlan me 52 points of damage just then no scanlan 52 you have three points left that's okay the other wyvern is still mad at the first one so that's good oh man okay yeah scanlan i got you i shoot from my bow of the sky sentinel fuck i did but i only used my burning thingy once so i can do that okay okay okay okay okay so i'm going to move my hunter's mark to one of the guys around scanlan yeah sure or the least wounded of them actually okay and then i'm going to shoot-- i'm going to shoot arrows all right i'm going to shoot through my blazing bowstring on that guy and the guy in front of him yeah okay so i forget how to do that i roll to attack why is this so hard okay 18 okay i'm going to roll damage on that one which is ten plus my normal eight 12 14 plus six for hunter's mark 20 plus six for sneak attack bitch no i was calling that guy a bitch 6d6 so that's 25 damage against the first guy yay okay so the second guy is another 18 actually no that's a 20-whatever yeah okay 14 15 16 do i get sneak attack on him too dang it so 16 damage against that guy i'm going to-- yeah take a potion heal yourself oh my god that guy is going to be so-- nice i'm going to cast hunter's mark on the one fighting-- yeah percy and i'm going to first attack the one fighting grog 16 yes okay 17 plus sneak attack-- 18 and i shift my attention over to the one fighting percy and that is 30 no 28 nine ten 11-- where's my dex 17 i'm staying where i am actually i'm going to jump off the roof and rush over to scanlan 24 yeah oh no dice down next time stealth we should get inside we should hide good call if you can do this quickly keyleth because we need to hide these bodies let's get them inside no we've got to get the wyverns inside if anything flying overhead sees these bodies they know something's been attacked i'll have the bag just the dust of tracelessness i start putting the dust of tracelessness down on the ground so it looks like nobody's been here is it good for you should we take a short rest though before we head down to the clasp because some of us have taken some hits-- okay before we head down this is why i left trinket because he wouldn't have been able to come down here anyway just so you know oh i'll heal you i'm going to heal you-- you don't have the-- the rock doesn't work until we sleep you don't have anything you're better at talking than the rest of us are how will i know if you get into trouble and your hands are tied-- we can all hear you (laughter) hold on just a moment mind the gap eugh fuck it smells down here do i have to step in the water yes stalked what and said it was me no-- a stick of human tongues what the fuck okay i will do that i want to know that tongue guy that looks like me-- is he dead or is he alive now they gave him to some stalker some stalker so there could be at this moment in time another person that looks just like me parading around the world well thank you for you know doing that-- (nervous laugh) was it the clasp here was it the clasp in westruun well these guys probably don't know me i'll put my hood up-- i would like to find out who the guy was that wanted me though that's kind of weird thank you for everything thank you you always have my back and i know it and for that i won't say very much everyone can come down i'm guessing towards the light is where they are scanlan do you have something that can make disguises don't you have like not the mustache but something that can really change my looks could i use that oh it takes like a little bit or just me how about just me i've got a question though here's the thing if you think that they know what i look like don't you think they know what you look like because you look just like me so what difference does it make if i'm there or not all right all right all right seeming how about that okay seeming please scanlan what if i heal you how about a limerick as payment scanlan for you i'll give you a limerick hold on i've been preparing it-- have you heard tale of scanlan the bard / or burt reynolds if you look at his card always tries to get laid / sometimes with ladies he made but i still respect him 'cause rhyming is hard (laughter cheering) yay oh thanks scanlan i take off my circlet i guess and i put on the hat let's go towards-- can i look too oh he doesn't need my help and vasselheim there's no guarantees you'll be able to get in anywhere it is but the sooner these dragons are defeated the sooner business can get back to usual ow i mean-- (fake coughs) eh don't say that but i don't want to introduce them to vasselheim no we're already here keyleth can i join in 33 i turn my back to him and i say he can read our lips as well as i can i don't think they'd listen to us anyway honestly offering to sweeten the pot-- we're defeating a fucking dragon let them get back to normal we could say-- they certainly can't do it without us and we can't do it without them but we'll be bringing in other armies with us who would we even introduce you to and we gave you something very powerful in exchange don't do it we'll just back up i do not turn my back i walk backwards the entire way out with an arrow notched keyleth darling could you maybe make a wall of stone and close off this tunnel this mark is it magic can they trace you through this mark of course similar to when you hit me in my arm straight up-- that's deep grog i like it i cast cure wounds on-- i already did it too late i fucking touched you fucker it just takes the pain away can we go back to the keep stealth check pass without a trace then what's the point of anybody rolling 37 add ten nice we need to sleep we need to get up in the morning-- i think we need to go to vasselheim or whitestone no we don't but we also need to find out what's happening with allura in whiterun westruun all those cities that's wonderful you going to sleep grog bow-chicka-wow-wow i give scanlan the hat of disguise back yeah fuck 'em i take his face and i push him down on the ground do we have a plan yeah we need to go to whitestone then yeah let's do that wait all of our guards and our servants as well i don't want to leave everyone here i don't know what else to do if dragons attack our five guards aren't going to be able to do anything we find a new keep i guess we should go tell the guards that they probably will have to leave if they want well i don't want to force them to but of course they're welcome to all right he's the captain of the guards anyway i leave a note for allura and tell her we've headed to whitestone as well i don't say whitestone i say the place where we sent you originally so she knows where it is not yet keyleth i mean it's the first time we've had a home in forever and we're leaving it we can go it's nothing it's just stone let's go yeah buy as much as we can buy stuff in vasselheim i mean i'm not going to say no to the gold so very generous of you i like it of course yeah teleport right just pop on over yeah we sleep for the night and then we go over to vasselheim the next day hang out in whitestone for the day what okay i mean it's your city and i love you for it no magic in the city remember oh is there a teleportation circle do we have one in whitestone we always have rooms at slayer's take remember is gilmore staying here in whitestone yes no it makes sense to leave him here right where do you want to stay gilmore understandable you've got a whole bookstore devoted to you here all right cool slayer's take business we'll keep moving don't worry we took care of it yeah let's go post up her home just to let them know we're here and we need some rooms (laughs) oi it has hi dragons have you heard about anything we're going to need rooms your wife that's his wife oh healthy is zahra around that's wonderful well settle in (whispering) aldor yeah yeah i wonder if kashaw is still here oh right keyleth the guy that kissed you he was very handsome it's morning still maybe nessa and zahra have seen him we could find out we could use another healer always pike speaking of clerics do you want to check in with your temple oh she didn't even come to vasselheim yeah we probably should leave the stone with her so she can pop in with us shut up trinket is right here right now he has been quiet because he's really well-behaved so stealthy darling i'm afraid to start anything it's 1100 oh okay i want to wait and talk to zahra right but i do want to buy potions as well and stock up what i'm going to stock up on a bunch of stuff yeah we did and it's sad we can't help it from there we have to go somewhere else in order to come back to it let it go don't say that
