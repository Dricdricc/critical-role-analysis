best buds aren't they it's a small group of people they have to patrons lives here in the feywild are we really going to pledge allegiance to a bunch of different gods that's what we're going to do like captain planet who is that you did the moon weaver they have a temple to her in syngorn ioun is the goddess of knowledge let's go to vasselheim start with one that really likes you so sarenrae's a good call there vasselheim wait we didn't talk to artagan artagan are you here can you hear us do you want to help us right as we go i start howling (howling) oh shit oh god what if it's been years we could lose our memories we're immune to that right people with fey ancestry yeah you have it too you're a half-elf didn't you lose your memory last time did we ever realize that you lost your memory the last time is that how we did it before what are you doing scanlan stop it stop it that's why your eye hurts vecna was wearing a big dress so we probably could have seen his balls what he knows where vecna is cool that's badass 350 miles how far is that from us right now where is that in distance really it's that close okay eight-hour drive okay why i don't know what you're talking about to the temple of sarenrae i walk up to him and put my hands on the sides of his face i can't have you away from me right now you just had a really long conversation with her of course not sarenrae's a big fan of the cube let's do it you did this holy shit can you try just talking to sarenrae what happened we saw you praying and you had this crazy look in your eyes so happy what is it you're not here she gave us a key to find her what the-- wow what was she like yeah wow that's convenient (singing) fortress of the sun this could affect everyone so there's this guy he's a shithead okay there's this guy he wanted to be a god but he wasn't a god we explain the story of vecna and tell him he's back he's here he's here on this plane and he's trying to become a god and who knows maybe he succeeded how long were we in the feywild do we even know that for sure what's the date but we don't know it oh of course it is does that sound normal to us for one roll get ready to fight
