a ball of lightning but everything's okay she's good we're going to get some tea though the mast looks like it maybe got burned a little again why don't you stop being a dick i crawl up and cast

thank you caduceus the balleater oh yeah and also our captain also eats balls you feeling any better yasha what made you leave in the first place (background music) it had to be scary right if that's all you'd ever known why you can say what it is (whispering) i won't tell anyone whoa that's a cool name (gasps) you got married yasha yasha you're not a coward you're one of the bravest people i've ever met what was her name that's really beautiful did he heal your heart or are you still sad i didn't know and then molly curses and luck they go together if you don't believe in luck you can't believe in being cursed either and molly's still with us the same way that your beautiful wife is (gasps) you didn't put some of that stuff in did you minty people (background music) i won't tell anyone thank you for trusting us with that yasha sometimes it helps to say things out loud really yeah to minty families yes yeah that is awesome yeah do we have to go to the bottom of the ocean again also it was in avantika's journal wasn't it you remember caleb it's possible you don't know you're not going to come with us again yeah and we defeated her yeah but we still defeated her we got the orb we also stole some shit yeah i got at least five gold nott i don't want to force you to come of course not you can stay up here if you want and i'm not going to talk about dangers and murky depths and stuff like that i will say that you saved my life and i don't feel as comfortable going into a battle without you wait so if i was petting frumpkin when you were doing that would he slowly lose his fur and grow tentacles or would it be a poof okay come on frumpkin ugh it's never good oh no oh no we did we got a long rest yeah we still got a long rest ugh oh gosh we're all watching you but if he does-- looking good stealth natural 20 straight up light up oh i'll give you a blessing of the trickster that's advantage natural 20 oh i left the weasel on the ship again i didn't bring him with me yeah i'm not going to kill my weasel it's like the snake people on the other island where do we go fjord i say we all attack each one until each one is dead we don't spread it out too much focus on-- yeah yeah i could invoke duplicity down there and see if they attack us if they do then we can attack them just going for it how spread out are they i'll go with beau yeah mine is also a save against dex of 15 18 hey guiding bolt at the one coming closest 14 okay 14 points of radiant damage no because a crossbow you don't roll at disadvantage i've hit one of them with guiding bolt and you have advantage against it ew x-files would it still be at disadvantage though on the second attack that's my favorite combo use your sword attack the one at beau okay i'm going toll the dead at the one at beau wisdom 15 i'm going to stay put yasha you better fucking help us are you raging that was a seven that wasn't a one that was a seven and a four yeah that's the first time i've heard sam say okay okay okay sam and what is that (exaggerated southern accent) careful they spit needles eww so it would be five more points of-- toll the dead at the same time ah doesn't save oh 22 points of (tolling bell) damage through the water the toll the dead vibrations going through the water so all of us can feel it go team can you see through its eyes like frumpkin there's no other entrance on the tower just the one that we see oh i give-- bless you you get advantage i'm also keeping an eye out to see if i see anything come out of the front entrance 17 perception what did it look like that's weird see if it attacks it sure yeah what does that mean what did that delayed reaction mean ugh are we going in the top tunnel or the bottom oh attacks okay all right follow behind him and land who's within 30 feet you are you are nott yasha yeah who's within 30 feet of me i don't think you would benefit from this yeah are we about to do this now i'm going to bless taking a cue from caduceus on yasha beau and fjord that gives you a d4 to add to your attack rolls and saving throws i'm picturing those big creatures that are in the dark crystal you know what i'm talking about oh fuck that's way scarier-- what date are we starting back up again oh man oh my goodness yeah that's cool ooh it does look like a forked tongue what the fuck is going on sleep for a hundred years i
