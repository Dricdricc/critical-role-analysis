trouble wait i have a question when we're paralyzed does that mean every attack against us is a critical okay i'm done they're making so much money tonight he's about to are his robes floating around

going to say okay i hope you're with me right now because i really need your help i'm going to try to turn undead no i'm going to jump up behind frumpkin 30 feet wisdom save yes it has to make a wisdom saving throw yes 16 succeeds that's my action and for my bonus action i'm going to cast sanctuary on-- who's the lowest on myself (laughter) it was also the only wisp that wasn't affected by the turn undead where did that confetti come from oh i missed your welcome party are you going to do your thing all the stuff that's a good name for it (shouting) steal his heart take his heart wait don't you have to make a wisdom saving throw against my sanctuary because you did a harmful spell against me right i didn't roll anything yet ten i'm unconscious don't waste a healing potion on me i have healing packs in my bag i have doughnuts (gasping) molly this is a bad day you guys today is really hard i guess i'll walk over and try to take out the pot can i try to throw something at it yeah i don't think i have anything that will fit through that little hole-- i could try picking up a rock on the ground and throwing it at it i probably don't see one if i did it would take a whole lot of time three no it's fine i just woke up you guys good job oh no he's back okay we run away grab his heart and run from the ground let's run away it's a two-handed weapon i can't do it i can't use two-handed weapons oh his body's somewhere maybe there's something behind the bookcase it's immune to fire can you catch fire to the bookcase should i try to heal yasha or move the bookcase i'm the strong one i can use my last spell i have a 2nd-level spell i'm going to bonus action use healing word at 2nd-level on yasha to bring her back and then i'm going to run over and try to crash the bookcase down six plus four ten can i get all the way over to the bookcase i try to yank it over 16 is there anything behind it i bet its remains are in there kill it i don't think i can do anything else wait we should heal you guys should we take a short rest and heal up a little bit oh you're welcome you deserved it so much you did so good let's see let me look in my possessions i don't think i have any butter is it pretty can i look at the art do i know the artists i don't know what's going on well that's not as cool ooh they're antique i put them in the bag how about that what is it i've got an herbalism kit can i use my herbalism kit to get rid of the poison that's 21 are there any rings caleb you should see if the rings are magic it also includes the sword and the vases can i try doing the mending cantrip on it would that help (singing) le le le le le that's still cool hey that's good whoa what else does it-- it's a two-handed then because it's a great-- we could use it on not-people as well maybe on objects (laughter) that's how you hold a greatsword oh it's dark is it cursed does it feel cursed so siff didn't have any feet do you think taking the sword off the wall was what made siff be able to come back hmm at least we're not dead you guys oh we can put them on now they're not magic i should get an extra one for healing you for poison so that's two for me i get caleb's because he's not saying anything that's three for me how many is that seven eight yasha that's two rings left for you or in your nose there has to be a hole in it for you to be able to do that what is he writing no i didn't lose the page i lost the whole spiral yes well things moved for some reason does anybody see a little-- yeah because i need it get evidence of something he may let us keep some of the spoils i bet they're worth a lot of money though rich people love old things one ring mine rules them all though i already took his ring so technically-- here (singing) i have two rings now still what about the sword i mean he probably can't even hold a greatsword it's a little big for the haversack not quite so much it's only eight cubic feet i don't think it works quite like that it has to be a broken thing as long as there were no ashes in it oh it wasn't an herbalism kit i'm stupid it wasn't an herbalism kit that could heal the poison it was medicinal herbs that's what i had in my inventory that i remembered i definitely start drawing that in my notebook you can keep a dream journal that's a good way to do it write it down immediately what you remember it really helps are we going to tell him about the sword only if he notices the sword i can try to fit it in the bag if it pierces it's bad rub some of the ash on it like it can be up your butt i have some crossbow bolts and this crowbar and the sledgehammer-- i have this longsword i have these old vases that we're going to give him i have this old dodecahedron and i open up the lead box this is really taking up a lot of space i start shoving it all back in we have boom sticks i'm listening what it might work we can try to fit it yeah does it have a scabbard we should probably get one of those made it works it doesn't get pierced from the inside it can only be pierced from the outside right yeah it's too big what if i take the sledgehammer out i'll take the sledgehammer out will it fit once i take the sledgehammer out i don't think the sword is going to fucking fit here he probably thinks we're dead you guys oh man we should have tried to go through that teleportation circle yeah we should have tried harder thank you for saving me molly thank you for saving me fjord i have to go in the other boat it has been a really long day so far or we go check out what's farther along just a little bit i feel like this is stupid see you never if the current starts to pick up we're going to fight it and try to go back yes yeah oh i don't think it works that far away from him oh that's where the fork was it comes back together yeah keep going straight ahead we're turning back and going the other way constitution check that's pretty good 16 oh no there's a waterfall does it seem like there are any boats that are broken at the bottom of it is there anywhere to stop the boat i only rolled a ten is the waterfall really hardcore could we see if there's anything behind the waterfall i try to get closer so that she can poke through the waterfall should we go do you think it's going to bludgeon us oh you're going you're jumping now you're not going to try to get the boat through i try to get the boat through i save the boat okay i try to push off and not sink the boat jeez oh much better 21 i really want to go see what's behind the waterfall but i don't want to lose the boat we'll lose the boat if i jump out of the boat is there anything to tie the boat on do you see anything on the other side it'll be like a cold peppermint drink it'll be good it does because i've been doing it at home did you find anything (breathy) okay i lift him up by his armpits (laughter) oh that's-- ooh it's a good place to hide though too fjord even wet you're like 150 (laughter) right fjord 150 no it's even better right oh shit i'm getting real tired you guys-- oh i'm not i'm not getting tired at all actually 17 do we want to long rest or go back liam and let's camp just inside of the rock collapse it is immediately then yeah at the bottom right before the staircase right inside (singing) because he was in the water before sorry i want to bring this with me that's all yes we did a long-y rest-y are you all wet again no dampness fjord you have a little something right here did you bite your lip is that why-- is it a sleep thing is that why well you know (whispering) well i don't want to say anything i'm afraid it will offend him (whispering) well most of the half-orcs i've seen have bigger tusks (loudly) it's okay fjord if you don't have a big tusk it's not a big deal it's totally fine (sympathetic) just on the tusks who it really is do you still feel the same way about your teeth you have to continue to do it is that why you have blood on your mouth were you filing your teeth last night is that nine no way the emotional poking was too much the guy in tusk love had them i think you would look fine either way fjord i'm saying if you want to you would look good that way as well you look good this way you would look good that way i'm good warm blooded nott on the sword (singing) sword up the butt (singing) yep straight up (singing) just like a puppet if he notices it then he notices it if he doesn't then he doesn't i'm really good at lying let's get in the boats harder because there're things there yeah eyes on the side where the rock guys were oh no she rolled well this a strength check five oh blessing of the trickster sure on you you get advantage 12 to be fair i am rowing (exaggerated southern accent) i'm rowing a boat (exaggerated southern accent) that's a 13 it's because you went so fast through the other area you have to pace yourself we killed stuff we are really badass no she said he was probably awake well the moon-touched sword is it small enough to fit in the bag or is it-- (fake wolf whistles) early in the morning yeah so many will-o'-wisps did you know you just have to break a vase and you kill a will-o'-wisp yeah this big cube came down from the ceiling and it tried to eat us it's pretty scary oh yes i pull out the vases look at these antiques careful they're very old i bet they're worth a whole of money then huh we found some candlesticks too it was seven i give one of the extra rings yeah i know 16 i think we killed everything we see two rock creatures that were really big but they're really slow so bolt on past them and they won't be able to catch you there were a lot of burned books mostly be careful walking on them you'll see them they're pretty obvious now well there were two paths in the river and the second path lead to a waterfall i don't know what was at the top of the waterfall there could be a chamber up there i don't know the other side lead to the thing is there anything else we're the worst we almost died (mumbling) i could look in my bag do i believe him is that an 11 or a 17 17 21 yeah that's a 17 21 he's being honest we're really good at that what a day we have stuff to sell should we go do that now or should we lay low for a little bit and make sure that he doesn't have anyone following us let's go back to the leaky tap we do have some rings to sell i guess if we wanted to did you ever look at those chains did you look at the mantacles the mantacles to see if they were magical we should probably stop going to-- maybe not to pumat sol for a little bit i'm sure you should probably take a bath nott i know you don't like water but this is an extreme version i think probably at least a damp towel oh yeah there was something about that yeah in the victory pit what happened to the children i start yelling out the third of the fessuran is the end of the harvest hide your kids hide your wife there's a victory pit i have a lot of rings i should see if i can get any good money for some of them i have some fancier rings though from before that were stolen from your boss what happened to sean connery i want to scout out the hearth of the allhammer the raven's den in the graveyard and the platinum house and see if there's a lot of guards or if there's any of those that don't have a lot of guards is there any one that seems emptier than other ones could i try to get in there when nobody's in there can i get in my disguise kit and affix a mustache onto her porcelain mask and put a wig on her and then write across the bottom of it the traveler was here and leave a pamphlet i want to see as much as i can do in that amount of time before anybody comes back oh no off to a good start nine oh hello yes there was a smudge on her face and i know that the people get really pissed when there's stuff on their statues i was trying to clean it off for you i rub my arm across it to try and clean it off i think i got it though don't worry i'm going to sit here and worship her now that's all oh that'd be great does that always happen when you pray to this lady she does i know she does because she likes me so much because i worship her real good you too shit damn it is there anything to tuck a pamphlet into yeah i'll do that at least yes i'm going to try some other time skein i can do a medicine check do you want me to look at it i mean we could poison somebody later that would be fun like legend can i look at the stuff wait what i'm going to follow behind and throw pebbles at them from behind oh no we're following behind you guys right here you guys looked like idiots

date to talk about his special package no we're good i open up the haversack and pull out the box okay okay (clenching) yes that's probably good because people are still looking for it probably so
