people pockets off of people pockets no it's totally fine i don't care you haven't done that here have you no we already ate we're fine we're so full did you try winking it's certainly things we've done in the past are we talking about general krieg's house or are we talking about the guy that we first came into his house in emon remember the diplomat it's probably general krieg's place rage-looting it could be a different house does it sound like general krieg's place did you get a description of the place that's like every house though because he was a dragon was that his house that he's describing we haven't agreed to it we agreed to give you a cut if we go in here's the thing if you haven't noticed we have a keep an embassy we're known around town we're council members we can't go stealing things from people's houses and then it was obtained by somebody else who you don't know who it is he was so dreamy do you remember him we have one room in addition to what we stay in would all of you be staying in the same one or would you want to stay in the temple you invited them to stay because you want to bone kaylie where are you going perv (laughter) i'm going to stay up and keep an eye on the doors when they go into their rooms and make sure they actually stay-- actually no i'm going to go find jareth jarett oh my she's going to rob you blind you're drunk go to sleep (laughing) what oh she rolled high too aw a natural one that was awesome [break] i had in the night i had gone to find jarett just to tell him to keep an eye on the rooms and everything because you know i'm sure they're all great people but-- i know they have some shady practices so i just want to make sure that-- can i check around look around the keep and make sure-- i mean in the general area and see if anything's missing seriously i do not trust these people yeah where is our five-thou did it get delivered i'm asking the guards at the front if anybody came from the keep from uriel where is it what did it look like where did erwen put it where did you put it where did you put it where's erwen just tell me where the fuck erwen is fuck i go inside to find erwen you look wonderful today box box box where did it go box the box that came last night yes our guests did our guests did i go storming into the breakfast area dr dre dr dra hey yes you had the best night's sleep here i bet so comfortable lots of wine that box give it to me now that's so kind of you i can read lips what did he say (laughter) okay thank you so much i open it up and count it in case we got robbed that's so kind of you what nice friends you have scanlan they're so giving with someone else it's normally so loud (laughs) don't worry about it keyleth we'll talk about it on the way i fully fully intend-- thank you maybe if somebody wasn't so drunk last night they would've had the information oh well aww i don't want to steal anything either yes she is because it's our house trinket follows before i do keyleth seriously i don't want to steal anything i want to find out why these-- they can't hear me i'm whispering to her we're walking i want to find out why they want to get into the house that's all something shady's going on we're keeping things safe i don't like them at our keep we're fucking taking the fucking bear that's my whole fighting fucking thing is i have a fucking bear that's the whole point of the class that i took i keep the bear yeah classes you know writing creative writing yeah i'm learning things every day yeah go around the back any signs of life one can i ask you guys before we do anything maybe it would be best to tell the guards that we're investigating a disappearance we've heard things about the house and we need to check inside it's obviously shady if we go sneaking in but if we say we're going in the house because we worry for it then it's okay maybe grog i mean they probably have a key to general krieg's place we can just barge on in did somebody buy it after him oh no there's a gate around the outside anybody want a peanut subtle so stealthy now so you have a very wrinkly red cloak on right now asshole i feel like we have a blessing of sarenrae though to go inside oh right behind the tapestry right trinket is actually really good at sniffing things out so maybe he can lead us to the smell okay it's too much it's advantage because of his smell shut up shit they do 16 is there dust on the ground has it been that long is there anything changing the dust is there any tracks in it or anything don't eat it grog nice sure i'll go upstairs
