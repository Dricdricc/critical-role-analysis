that was me what if we get the weapons off the priestesses and put them in the holes then you could do that it would keep them from coming up through it as long as it was blocking yes yeah so we could shove a sword in there yeah this is so fucked up i'm into it oh god well how about i just drag the bodies over i start dragging the body over and shoving an arm in the hole i'm pushing them yeah oh no

draw them what do they say should we have been keeping track of which ones were on which wall caleb do you want to eat some fruit and look at the-- yeah i give her my sketchbook with ink and stuff so she can draw the runes that she sees i thought you were trying to say by people (singing) you need to eat some fruit eat the fruit you have to eat the fruit here i cut some fruit and stick it on his mouth too late i already put it on his mouth too late he's already getting high caleb caleb caleb there's another wall tell us what the walls say i go with him i'm coming what does it say that's the east let's go to the next one go to the 'nother one yeah that's the top thing the warden guards the false serpent the false serpent let's look for the warden oh you guys are the wardens you guys are the wardens oh no get caleb off the ground i lift caleb off the ground because i'm next to caleb still doesn't hit me i am walking around so the vines don't get me what didn't cut through good point did i get to do an action on that last one no okay i'm going to cast spirit guardians can i walk over to where nott is i'm going to cast spirit guardians and anything that enters that space has to make a wisdom saving throw or take 3d8 radiant damage wisdom save of 15 this is the vines that are attacking you and if i'm close by anything that's attacking me too okay 11 points of radiant damage no 3d8 those are 3d6 hold on i rolled wrong ooh that's better 15 no i'm good oh that's-- 22 technically-- you suck vines trees and vines i have no idea what turn is what --there are little pocket unicorns dancing around i just wanted you to know (posh accent) 23 get her off the ground get her off the ground as i spit on him oh wait but they should've taken damage on my turn again on their turn

again that's five i say put him down just like yasha i echo yasha then i radiant damage the vine and then i stomp it with my giant feet and then i also lift fjord up onto my other shoulder don't worry little children you're sitting on my shoulder caleb is draped over the shoulder we need to heal heal nott heal nott how long does it last (brief exertion) no i'm sorry-- that you weren't protected earlier i'm good thank you for asking is he still high are you still high are either of you still high spiritual unicorns are dancing around you guys as this is going on they're like this big can i try reaching with my hands and pulling no i'm still big no i'm not still big (humming) no 12 like a lever like a switch or anything same i'm going to take some and put it in my bag again where were you i wander over and see if there was a dead body in the other one whoa did you see that that was crazy 13 what does the body look like anything in the satchel did it look like-- like no way i could tell if she took anything from the satchel she took something from the satchel i stomp back to the rest of the group (laughter) go beau you're so cool you should lead it me yes beau i'm going to give you blessing of the trickster right in front of you 15 this is where the warden lives (whispered) has it been more than ten minutes since the fight (whispered) okay just checking (whispered) i feel like we should spring an attack on him (normal voice) i feel like we should spring an attack on him we do fluffernutter i'm pulling out the little keg of black powder that nott stole from the pirate ship fluffernutter we're whispering all of this very quietly we could fireball it (whispered) another person could be invisible (whispered) i could have the keg yeah or i could be invisible go in and touch him and cast inflict wounds it does a lot of damage if it hits it's 5d10 and it's heavy i could invoke duplicity in there and then inflict wounds with my duplicate she can't carry anything i'll duplicate in and inflict wounds i can make my duplicate silent yeah it's a duplicate it's not going to touch anything really it's a hologram it's an illusion we already did it today okay at the same time yeah so that he doesn't see it coming let's do it okay would i know if when i cast my duplicate does it make a sound it's not a loser it's really cool or go around it it doesn't have to go across the water does it look like it's got its eyes closed 19 okay okay i'm going to invoke duplicity okay she can move up to 120 feet so she's going to float silently and be on-- yeah behind it so it doesn't see it yes okay then i'm going to cue nott and at the same time i'm going to inflict wounds 3rd-level you can shoot them at the same time one two three go at advantage okay wait got to look at my spell okay that's good16 plus seven is-- 16 plus seven is 23 38 38 times two 38 times two well isn't it because it's a sneak attack oh i'm thinking-- sorry critical hit you're right sorry 38 points yeah right oh stop (giggles) ey oh no at me but i could've hidden or something that's my armor class oh good it misses me does that reach the creature we won't see anything into it though because it's just black wow oh thank you caduceus nine (music) yes i was watching when he walked around the pillar so i saw where he went i'm going to send my duplicate backwards a few steps and hold out her hand and hope that she touches him yeah yeah at 3rd-level ah fuck me it doesn't hit nine man sucks okay that's fine they're really pretty right oh and i'm going to move around the corner so that he can't fucking shoot arrows at me yeah shit we haven't gotten to the false serpent yet this is the warden we couldn't even kill the stupid little snake guy how are we going to kill a hydra so stupid we didn't even see the heads come out we just see the heads pop out of this bubble of blackness can you flank it travis your face was just like-- that's the most amazing face you just made it landed three it got five attacks yeah is yasha raging oh no way you can actually pop off a head i like it it needs burning damage or else it's (popping) okay i'm going to move my duplicate outside of the tentacles close to the shitty guy that i was fighting before oh i have to keep a visual it is the case i didn't think about the fact when it was in there that i don't have visual on it i would have lost it before i ever cast that other spell oh jesus i don't know if works like that okay then-- oh can i move around the corner then see it i can't move it at all great cool that was an awesome-- yeah it happens i can't move my duplicate out of the darkness can i move it over to beau can i see that area over next to beau yeah or just like in front of the well okay well at least it's out i guess right now i'll just do jesus christ guiding bolt at 1st-level on the hydra 16 12 points of radiant and then next attack gets advantage on it then i move out-- i move back oh yeah advantage she gets advantage on the next hit one attack should i do it should i do it nott told me to do this fluffernutter i throw it but i throw it high towards the heads shut up don't curse it 11 we're almost in sync here that didn't go as well as i had hoped (shouting) fluffernutter for my bonus action i'm going to move my duplicate out and stand next to avantika she can't really do anything because i used my action she's just going to stare at avantika i'm going to hide around the corner and for my move the rest of my movement whoa now we have to burn the head with the-- aww it would've been so great if we would've succeeded we have to burn the heads we could do it like hercules and just keep making it reproduce yeah it's wet the keg is wet that's true i know 22 did you double the hex dice too i know but all i have is radiant flame that doesn't quite-- it's not the same it does yasha want to go first i'm going to-- jeez you're really hurt aren't you beau it just seems like a waste i feel like i should take out at least the other guy to lessen to the damage coming in what is the wisdom thing that you did the hydra or the-- marisha and i'm going to sacred flame the other guy okay oh no that was a dex save it doesn't matter i don't know what the fuck to do i'm trying to get this guy out okay i guess that's all i can fucking do tight shoot up-- kill the monster guy because he can kill beau-- he can do double damage right now to her if he hits her do it kill the guy yes he is he's right next to beau he can kill her kill her kill her (cooing) kill him a lot yeah go take it plus five up the butt i know he's going to get a hit on us i'm going to go down if i heal beau so i'm going to heal beau and hope that somebody takes care of him before he kills us i'm going to use my duplicate to reach down and touch beau can i see my duplicate well i'm already within range of him can i see okay i'm going to reach down and use cure wounds at level one because that's what i've got with touch yes ten points of healing that's all i've got i don't have anything to do for bonus outside of spiritual weapon okay okay i've got something can i bring my duplicate up next to me for my bonus action it is he gets a negative-- he gets disadvantage on attack rolls against me when my duplicate's next to me that's a lie i get on advantage on attacks they don't have disadvantage on me holy shit was it i mean beau would have definitely died
