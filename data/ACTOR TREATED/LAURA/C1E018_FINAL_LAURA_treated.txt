trinket trinket too this is my bear yes of course we get trinket scanlan do we get trinket on the trip this is trinket a brown one oh that would be lovely actually actually i think percy is quite hungry perhaps you've heard of us castle greyskull keep we have where did we meet aldor (gasps) that guy i mean he looked kind of like a dick if you want my personal opinion but-- i would like to thank you very much as well for putting us in her capable hands what do you eat do you eat-- does it get stuck in your teeth a lot superior perhaps that doesn't seem really-- i've got plenty take it if you need it i'll hold onto it i shall take it i will-- ha sorry lyra of course it's like a whip (gasps) but i won i won give it to me what please i already have it i already have it on my shoulder it's too late i'm writing it down a white dragon would i know i would know because i've studied them didn't we kill a white dragon travis and no i thought the ice dragon thing-- wasn't she white yeah the woman and then she turned into a dragon so anything else we get to keep ourselves and scales definitely there will be plenty of scales what about trinket does he use his paw trinket shake just the biggest one you killed someone who was sleeping with your boyfriend okay it's a person that changes into animals am i right oh you killed a wolf no yeah that's great oh they're really scary i mean he looked actually kind of frightened and whimpering really no yes he seems like he would have been had he hadn't-- especially when he got burned by tiberius his face is fine three days that's what i'm doing i'm checking that out oh that works too oh that's great well then we can use it in conjunction because i can use primeval awareness and find any dragons within six miles it's like fishing line coming out of his face percy's seen some shit so can i do that then i can't find his exact location but i can so can i-- shit zahra what about you do you know about dragons all right let's do that roll a d20 and add your religion great first roll 20 sees them you're not with us oh thank you dagon is that your name i've heard many things about your knowledge of dragons yes i have seen dragons and they suck unless you like them do you like them the glasswalk the glasswalk road yes of course and then there was a dragon i believe that you saw a dragon and i believe that it was white because you were in a blizzard right am i right very much like a worg if you will well actually dragon that's a giant dagger if i've ever seen one i would never have guessed that's where that was going white dragon whoa that's great how did you make it back without dying did the dragon keep flying in the direction of the glasswalk road or did it go east or west or which way we believe you actually could i roll for perception or insight to see if he's telling the truth on everything oh yeah two no 17 no is that a 17 or an 11 17 can i perception and see how heavy that bag of gold actually looks i just want to know okay i'm going to roll the gold dice 24 i love this plan go to the blizzard does the guild give you money for lovely as we're leaving i walk up behind lyra and i put my hand on her shoulder and then i reach down and grab her bag of gold and i (clears throat) and look down to it and say you might want to keep a better eye on this darling there are very very nasty people around i didn't take anything i'm simply letting you know thank you so much darling you have lovely eyes maybe when we shop you can tell me all about aldor blizzards it ices things we'll definitely need some sort of protection against ice attacks yeah how are we going to do that exactly thereabouts yes we definitely need warm things actually i have warm cloaks for the party and half of our party isn't here so we can have them seriously wait so does he give discounts to family members lyra i think we're going to be best friends so can we find horses in the area how about we rent them and if they don't make their way back we'll pay you the difference oh try it do it dc 17 right i mean uncle randy after all that's lovely wait well-- you can ride with me scanlan but trinket-- does he ride-- is he as fast as a horse well how-- no why do you always wanna leave my wonderful bear i know he almost dies every time i put him in battle it's ridiculous he is adorable isn't he oh okay okay well it's doable wait who's-- who's paying but it-- half our party isn't here so-- i am very very nervous that somebody is going to die when we fight this dragon ooh so protection against ice magic does anybody have stuff that works for that lyra do you know any-- should we call you uncle oh um i thought-- uncle randy definitely we're great trinket's wonderful no yeah since we're on a time crunch scanlan i'd say yes probably need to make camp there's also lots of wood around grog keyleth would be proud i miss my brother good job grog ah that's really good i need something like that do we have any magic stuff that makes us resistant i have one too yeah but we don't have any ice-resistant things outside of that damn-- are we starting a fire yeah of course we do grog one second here-- thank you grog you did you really did can i watch with zahra yes no it was us oh no it's quite comfortable against my side actually it's not heavy at all we don't have anything in it darling where do you come from we just don't see very many tieflings around here feren and you left because that sounds familiar yes actually my mother was killed yes a dragon (sighs) i wonder if it was white my father's alive an asshole actually really oh wow mine's just a jerk zahra getting a bit personal here around the fire (laughs) here have some food disgusting grog found it i don't know oh ugh grog what (groans) cream cancer yeah yeah yeah oh god how did i just immediately forget that's what we were doing oh i have to put my glasses on today my magic glasses of seeing eight yep oh god why did we all roll terribly i should have grabbed some of that dessert that's here trinket wake up oh god are they attacking percy oh no we're all going to die instakill this is the best night for percy ever yes definitely that's insane can we all get inspiration from seeing percy just massacre gross hell yeahthat's so mean oh no okay i'm going to cast-- how many people are on percy i'm going to do hunter's mark on the damaged one should i get-- yeah the one that's damaged yeah and i'm going to shoot him through my-- i'm going to shoot him through my flaming bow and i also am going to have trinket attack him twice how about that all right 19 attack yes plus the d10 for the flaming 17 to hit and then trinket's attacks trinket i never know what to look at because i never attack with trinket okay that's 22 for one the second one is a 16 oh my goodness i know you guys does that mean he can bite twice okay he's going to do that oh wait no one is going to be bite and one is going to be claws oh i didn't do hunter's mark on the previous one four for hunter's mark 13 no 12 for one attack and then-- what did i just do i did it wrong that was wrong i'm sorry i'm sorry is 11 for the first one and then the second one this is so new and exciting and 12 for the second yes have a meal buddy hell yeah i do that's me cantrip so 24 that's damage that's not a d10 that's a d12 oh you know what i was rolling eights instead of tens that's okay ten fuck it's like a hunter's mark all on your own how is she so cool (laughs) that poor orc did you get another 20 we have to fight dragons soon a dragon what did he say what did he say tell him we're just passing through heck yeah what is he going to fight with us can i try as well 16 is what i rolled well let's find out about our dragon first will he how do you know why don't we just ask him there's a dragon where is it do you know of a secret passageway to get up to it yeah well we're pretty stupid do you know of a path he is giving me sass i can actually i can most definitely detect the dragon so you're saying that we need to not be out in the open because the dragon is attracted to things that are not hidden you want to come with us then stop giving us sass did you see how fast we killed your friends we're pretty amazing yes most definitely we are but here's the thing-- well he probably would've led his friends to us to kill us (sings) scanlan make you feel good i'm gonna try to see if there's a dragon within-- what's that sorry can i primeval awareness the dragon the dragon then still it's still-- oh right it's towards a mountain is it okay to keep sleeping right here are they going to come search for us probably not more than one search party oh our horses are okay oh that's good oh that works too can you-- oh yes dust of tracelessness he's got this stuff we can cover our tracks yeah never oh poor thing yeah why did we-- the other team has the carpet those bastards why because tiberius can fly why the hell did we give them the carpet (laughter) all right are we still in the forest okay natural 20 sorry that was my first one it's bad thing to roll a natural 20 on it's trinket you know (gasps) sure i will try it again there there's a dragon it's fast wait it's up in the air we should hide just in case how about we hide no way 24 all of us are like ahh can i see which direction it's going back towards the mountain great we got to go in the forest well i can also you know see what kind of creatures are around no i can't i can't see animals just kidding all right oh you can't fly all of us can you you can fly up to nine people tiberius can only fly up to three people if we're flying though i'm just going to put this out there there's nowhere to hide if the dragon comes back out well that's awesome but is it at the same time or is it a concentration i have-- yes movement is fine for all of the group i would also like to perception ahead and make sure that nothing is going to sneak attack us again that is lower than my passive perception though which is 21 -- is 21 and plus five-- no that's it just 21 but it's a 12 for right now oh but i get to roll twice though because it's my favored terrain okay shut up it's-- no that's not that bad-- it's 15 it's a slight improvement that's right we're calling a car and it's however soon it gets here don't walk on this lake 16 we should avoid it do we see any-- anything along the bottom the edge of the mountain that looks like it could open into a cavern of some sort yeah delegate can we check oh that's smart grog that's really smart we'll get into cover maybe just to be safe ah what you're kidding me right that sucked you're kidding me it's a giant oh no you speak giant you speak giant right oh no no no shit i'm damaged i did i'm dead i feel like we did such a good job on the last one oh my gosh you have to be careful with my dice i've got gems in here oh my gosh you did and you-- and you made a guy like give us things for super cheap which is like the best thing in the world i do too yay that's just not appropriate i really have to go i love you yeah well-- i do-- to what just for the heck of it but i'll be on a panel the entire time it's a really long panel all right bye
