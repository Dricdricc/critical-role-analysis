no we've been listening in the car yeah no diamonds are vex's best friend ooh i'm cleaning my nails as i'm watching her make sure no lights are lit in our-- okay you got it keyleth oh no that's right in front of-- i pull out my cloaks in my bag and start trying to put out the flames keyleth what was that supposed to happen is that good was this good should i stop i keep putting out the flames they're sucking the life force out of the earth oh my god what if the vampire thing is right underneath us can i use my primeval awareness and sense any sort of vampiric presence within our very close vicinity it's a minute it's up to six miles if i spend six minutes (whispering) that's good bad probably bad we're just going to sleep surrounded by vampires we're just going to sleep surrounded by lots and lots of vampires you even did that awesome fire thing at the end that was really really cool really nice scanlan where is he at oh this is messed up 23 oh he could be evil we could turn evil here keyleth oh wait seeming has ended at this point hasn't it so trinket is a bear okay cool yeah i've been laying on him all night that's why it smells like it does grog i have a bear do you want to disguise the bear in the house all right i want like a crazy eye in my seeming yeah secret doors can i use a perception check to see if there's any kind of secret entrances in the rubble at all something that leads to a cellar i'll just old lady walk into the building and look around yeah she does this crazy-eyed old lady does i'm looking boy ooh with no advantage right that would have been an eight i can't see any kind of like door that leads to a cellar all right no yo-yos here boy but it's half-collapsed it would not be very protected what if we went to the fields and we asked other peasants how we report to what's-his-fuck keron keron kerrion so just bust on in and kill them right now yeah you look a little pale percy are you sick does keyleth need to cast i don't know restoration on you or something be killed never pop back out again we saw the tree i'm going to come with you kerrion kerrion we're new to town i smack him on the back of the head and say let's go boy keep up can we insight check him to see if it seems like he's changed at all or if he's still that same douchebag or if he's-- to the house the countess and she was which who was the countess again oh she is the one can i go up and ask keyleth outside of his earshot to maybe cast some sort of restoration on him without-- he's fighting it i don't think he's feeling well can you heal him he looks cold and kind of slimy and he's coughing a lot i know no that's true all right nobody will know right let's do it what oh no let's do it yeah i put a couple arrows in the holy oil that we have oh can i just dip one arrow in then right now 24 probably i cast pass without a trace on all of us is it possible to see what the movement is who it is inside that window is the cellar door hidden from view of everything or is it out in the open the cellar door that we saw does it look like anybody can see us they can't even see us though let's just up and over the bar athletic it acrobatics it fuck wrap your hands well we're in the back of the house we're stealthing 32 up against the wall of the building i feel like it's been a while since you've done this lockpicking could i stealth in a couple of steps look around and see if there's anybody in there or hear anything 19 it's clear let's go ish i wonder if they're going to notice that fence i got up to it and listen i don't hear anything you guys i think it's fine yeah your ears are huge compared to mine there's nothing there that's awesome yep rogues are awesome they might be close wait before we do this keyleth can you maybe make the gate outside not look like it's all bent to shit yeah oh wait no plus ten because pass without a trace hold okay i start climbing the-- grog up before me plus ten plus ten 34 grog first just run in surprise him really really i'm offended and i'm hurt i give you the worst evil eye i've ever given anyone i smack the back of your head again and it's hard because i'm angry right now yeah i want to stealth in behind grog after they go into the room (sing with the battle music) whoa look at you scanlan 13 that's all of us what does grog look like 23 no you're right can i go first so i don't do any damage to you guys if you guys go in i want to go in peek my head in and shoot-- first i'm going to shoot from my longbow of sky sentinel and i'm going to use-- it turns into three arrows for one of my attacks so it's three more attacks potentially okay i'm going to do that i'm going to attack him the guy the bad guy the one that's in charge kerrion yeah 28 okay so i make an attack for all three arrows oh that one doesn't hit well probably not 13 18 jeez louise what a waste of a storm arrow yes that was the wrong thing i can't i'm going to hunter's mark him after this first one because it's a bonus action what am i doing 14 15 16 and then plus another d6 so it's basically like hunter's mark right 19 is the first one and then i attack again i'm going to hunter's mark him now can i do that 29 i'm so confused right now i know 14 on the second one i totally shit the bed on that one guys and i apologize i had things i wanted to do that's right boy huh oh just right inside the door can i say i peeked in to shoot and then went back around the side of the door yeah it's ripley that's doing the guns oh no he's calling in backup i'm picturing him as what's-his-name in-- yeah yeah he has magic but mr filch doesn't have magic he's a squib squibs can't do magic yay yeah all right so i go in the room yeah i stay in the doorway actually no i back-- well yeah i'm staying right there i can't see is there a soldier right there next to the invisible guys or is it just the invisible guys actually i'm going to do lightning arrow because that gets everything within ten feet i'm going to cast lightning arrow on the soldier on the ground the one that keyleth's attacking can i move to a place where i get it awesome let's do it from there nice 27 okay so that is 4d8 damage to him and then anything within ten feet has to make a dex save yeah that's everything within ten feet 19 to little prone soldier to the little prone guy anybody within radius takes 1d8 if they make the save and then 2d8 if they fail one oh yeah does the hunter's mark damage him the invisible guy still if he gets hit with anything or is it just if i attack him with an arrow okay this is confusing actually that's 30 this is disgusting doesn't the guard get a-- yeah with your fire hands i want to loot the bodies i'm keeping a very strong eye on percy right now yeah tell him to go sit in a corner scanlan oh this is so wrong oh terrible no this is so wrong just knock him out what are we going to ask him okay where are the briarwoods are the briarwoods-- this is really smart i feel good about this no do they know we're here yeah do you know where they are yeah oh now i feel bad it's not guarded what is the project room is it hard to talk with no teeth do you know what they've done to the ground here do you know why nothing grows i just want to ask when do the briarwoods come out we can't stay the night i feel like it's a little stupid since we have nowhere to go i'm fully in support with burning down a house i just feel like it might backfire a bit hey buddy how's it going soon but not now let's go let's do it are we i open up a bottle of wine and take a giant swig yeah hey buddy let's go running toward the woods where are we running they're going to notice-- i don't i mean i can cast it right now yeah 24 pass without a trace i mean dust of tracelessness that was dark you guys super dark hey man did we hit 10k oh i like freddie mercury
