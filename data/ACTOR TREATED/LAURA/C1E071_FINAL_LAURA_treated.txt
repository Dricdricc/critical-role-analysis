no he wants to be right there you get to have that because you took two vestiges oh good times i'm in that i'm in that with you you'll hear me whoa that was double ones no gears of war came out this week no sam and no because i was thinking maybe it's a bad idea to go jumping into this tomorrow don't you think maybe we should wait a day i mean we could watch vorugal see what's going on see what his behavior is and also prepare a little bit more with the ravenites but that happening you might have to inform them that he's not actually going to have a-- tomorrow i know no he would have extra day to recover percy's not himself yet i just don't think it's the best idea to jump into this do you go back in the morning or do you go back now yeah she has the stone yes what exactly did you tell tooma was going to happen did you tell her to tell vorugal anything in particular yes shouldn't she inform vorugal that the monster is coming the big monster that we're setting for him yeah a giant ram haven't you seen the picture did you see the picture i'll go grab the book from percy as he's sleeping you don't get to say roll for it i'm just trying the big book of beasts away from percy as he's sleeping subtract some because you're still really tired from being dead that's what we see grog oh he's tiny i think he would see them what if you became a fly or something and flew down would he notice you i do and i can speak draconic sorry i didn't think about that last time all right can you make me invisible we'll pop down tonight to talk to her one more time hold off a day she's going to be so pissed nothing (groans) fenthras now you've got three vestiges should we go then can you make me invisible and we go okay i'm going to cast pass without a trace on us once you attune it to yourself-- okay no he said it really terribly sure did is anybody going to keep track of us like you kept track of vex-- vax i just called my brother me i just did that is somebody going to be around in case something goes horribly wrong stay up like kiki did before something very small like a moth a white moth he can sit on my shoulder no i'll just smack you and then you'll become you again right if i smack him it's not going to kill him he just turns back into-- make him a white crow come on let's go come on yeah definitely already 17 i get off the broom and put it behind me all right ow fuck you stop it oh i thought we were already in the cave i speak in draconic i say sorry my friend rambles my broom takes off behind me we will in draconic we apologize for waking you up unfortunately i sent my brother here before with our compatriot and he spoke out of turn we're actually planning the attack the day after tomorrow we'll be releasing a very large fiend the stones we hope that you will inform vorugal that it's going to happen he'll head over fight-fight-fight he becomes much weaker we jump in fight-fight-fight yes skork i remember him he won't be in chains exactly is that all right oh okay good news good great that's all be pleased we will see you in a couple of days no it's not we're not let's just go again i apologize for my brother he's an idiot okay you make us invisible is pass without a trace still active on us it's up to an hour thank you i thought we were invisible we're invisible okay stealth checks plus ten to whatever you roll 36 get the fuck off my head you piece of shit aw i thought you were serious give me the bow right now i'll think about it thank you she did she said she'd wait yeah oh shit day's coming we didn't sleep we need to sleep what if you take the stone pop over to her then use tree stride and come back oh shit dice jail oh my god matt why are you trying to kill her right when she gets here what just happened that's great oh shit grog open the door dust of tracelessness out the door right now close the door grog that might be smart actually but we're also up high and the ravine is down low that could make a difference oh i understand we don't want that those chicken candies what is this so we don't just look like cows laura and i have not seen very many animals i don't think is there a snowstorm does snow get thrown up to the wind behave like wind you guys that is so cool sure you're okay grog that you don't have the dagger i know you wanted it which he probably can't on me what about me i was looking straight at him perception 20 (sighs) you piece of shit dexterity 28 30 that's pretty cool i'm wondering if the mist form would not be better but the animals are really cool if we're not all dead come tomorrow maybe scout and then go back because mist form stays for eight hours so at least that way we can communicate not next to vorugal do we look natural do we look pretty obvious it could if you wanted it to yes we did i'll lead the way i'm going to keep an eye out to make sure nobody seems like they're-- especially towards vorugal's plateau to make sure he's not there perception is 30 15 towards the summoning circle okay 16 i look down towards it does it look like anything is around it oh no tree's down it is so pretty i would be looking for vorugal too though natural 20 all right can i float down and get a closer look at the weird marks you were talking about 13 behind those rocks right there we're still wind ask about what the rock is so you can find where to dig she might be with us right now she's here or it's thordak and ice dragons burrow i remember that much somebody that can turn invisible has to go get her yeah but she can't turn into mist so you can go get her and turn her into mist it's a little bit of light but we can hide behind something when she does it she can poof from within the mansion before you make the mansion but it's daylight so it should be fine why don't you go with her well we've been talking so i'm going to say yes i've been keeping an eye out but yes i will keep watch is anything watching us 28 i think we should all be mist though while we wait for them to get back just in case did we see him go in the air from where we are 20 i come out of mist form vorugal's not here right now if you're going to dig do it i'll keep an eye on the sky do it quickly if you're going to do something i draw out an intricate map blueprints i'm keeping an eye out for vorugal or anything suspicious so you can make walls even if she did it has to be something not noticeable yeah i can shoot from that height actually after you do it i can try to disguise it so it's not seeable from the air we can't do it in the middle of the stone we have to do it at the top he's like i spent a really long time carving this shit you guys and you're going to be altering it i saw him fly away yeah that what he's going to get help i guess yeah i can back in whitestone we hired somebody to come help us fight larkin do you have any spells you can use it is quite impolite i whisper to pike just fucking got it we hired him potentially the white one that's here that will be here so this is great tomorrow you pop in you summon we all pop back into the mansion we're hiding in the mansion while the fight's going on right so keyleth could be a hawk over by vorugal-- is there any way to let us know though yeah sounds great actually can i do primeval awareness and search for dragons to see if vorugal's even in the area at all mansion right now and run into it seriously get in the mansion right now he can't know that you know what if he sees you percy i'm better at hiding myself a lot of white i could always bring you up on the broom larkin is raishan really you're the last one to realize that no yeah one last thing that's okay marisha and feels good (gasps) you're immune to poison on this i got two tens i got an additional 20 now we sleep as i am going to sleep i want to inscribe sinaeth on fenthras yes i can't cast pass without a trace on him from that far away yes but that's only tracks while we're over there before i go over to my side i'm going to try to cover his area with natural explorer and try to hide him i have climbing gear you can use it as a grappling hook maybe does that work at all ten i don't think that matters have we left are me and percy outside already make us all white ravenites sorry i meant so we blend into the ice not so that we're white that sounded so terrible i meant so that we're the same color as the ice and we're camouflaged like chameleons who all is leaving how long does that last 18 bundle is vorugal back he's back do we see larkin around well maybe if we cause enough of a ruckus as soon as we release him we need to make a lot of noise and then release it attract attention release it hide whenever we want to vorugal will come when we make a noise he'll come over here no she told him that it's coming i don't think she's telling him a specific time i walk over give us 30 minutes and then do it percy up all right i take percy up top i try to move some snow around and try to block it don't say that again yeah can you make us invisible can i fly up and see if i can see percy before i head over to my side i don't want to go too high 17 32 shit i dive back down and try to cover him a little bit more before i head over to my side i'm going to cast pass without a trace on myself as soon as i get to the other side so i can stay stealthed on my side on the other ledge yeah i'm trying to hide myself yes 32 you know what i want to pop trinket out i want him to be in the mansion with pike and grog go hide kima oh she doesn't have an earring keyleth shouldn't you hide in the mansion shouldn't you hide right now just be out of the way until vorugal-- we've got eyes on we're above just go hide do we see him in the sky at all 19 scanlan what are you doing cast it oh my god oh my god oh no he's so big i hope we can take it and it actually does damage i know this feels like more like playtime than anything all the action figures bam bam bam while this is going on percival if yenk dies really fast what do we do oh fuck oh that's great he hasn't burned through any resistances though he's on the ground in the dragon again (laughing) four so you're on vorugal right now you have wings 13 that's worse than it was before can i see all this happening i'm going to take an arrow and shoot it i can see the door but it's not going to register on a magical door is it fuck me no not yet they can't hear you percy i can hear you but they can't try and ground vorugal try it i guess as soon as i see everybody run out i would start attacking (yelling) yes oh no what are you looking at did i ever get on the initiative order it would be insane yeah a zero that's okay i'm going to cast hunter's mark on vorugal okay so i'm hidden technically so i get sneak attack on him right okay so i'm going to hit him or try to that is 34 30 points of damage on the first hit and two of those are lightning 22 on the second two of which are lightning i did i'm going to hang out there and duck down if i can behind my little outcropping hey matt do it keyleth it doesn't count on the floor maybe it's like hex and hunter's mark who's doing a blight spell sam and i do poor kima trying to get mind-wiped so many times by him oh you have three daggers still okay i'm going to try to hit him a couple times my moves are really intricate 25 for the first one and i'm using blazing bowstring on this okay (counting) oh okay i have 40 points of damage on the first hit two of which are lightning seven of which are fire damage and i get sneak attack because vax is on him it's fenthras and then 25 on the second hit no that's just to attack oh jeez louise (counting) 23 on the second one with four points of lightning damage and two points of fire damage and i'm going to use my bonus action to hide pass without a trace still on me right so that is 27 do it towards the front of vorugal so it doesn't hit vax liam and oh do you even have to roll the attack on that it's 8d6 what's yenk doing down there sleeping it's that new damn gun its sight is all shit the three of you down on the ground good old larkin don't you fucking ditch don't you ditch out she's going she's doing it she's so teeny compared to him would he still look like a little dragonborn it did it did the fire damage against the dragon you get an attack of opportunity how do you want to do this okay so that's unconscious what the fuck are you doing now matthew are you unconscious too all dice are doubled is that how it works i know and he kills everything did you add your ten to the final one it was 38 on the final can we see a little spire poking through its belly you can be a coward scanlan it's okay four scanlan get somewhere safe that way you can keep helping her oh does he get an attack of opportunity on you because you fly by my boyfriend fuck i'm going to try to get his attention and say hey stupid and then i'm going to hit him because that's all i've got 22 do i have sneak attack on him at all marisha is next to him so no sneak attack although i was hidden at the end of last turn (counting) 28 on the first that was damage and then the second attack hits it's a 31 (counting) 1d8 plus eight plus two for dragon plus hunter's mark 24 with two lighting damage the first one had four lightning damage (sighs) i want to help i just don't know what i can do that's all i can keep doing i'm going to use my bonus action to hide like an asshole 13 can you grasping vine them through the mansion door it's open right kick him on the way up and then he'll follow you blight spell what does stone's endurance do plus ten well one hopefully what did you get greater can you dimension door and then run with her he's at two failed pike's at one we can still hit him with the ranged okay i'm going to hit him twice 27 25 on the first the second is also 27 oh my god i want to see a cut on his stomach where yenk left a hole and i want to go straight into his heart and a tree grows out of his guts i fly down and cast cure wounds on vax get inside now i'm going to fly over and try to help percy now that they're safe i land next to them oh my god let's get inside (offscreen clatter) i stay out and i search more around yenk did you see how weak she was compared to vorugal i take an empty potion bottle out and get some of yenk's blood and put it in the cold thank you loot crate
