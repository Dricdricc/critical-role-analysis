if he's been successful we didn't even realize that was an option we intend to face him down ourselves pelor mentioned something about the prime trammels it's okay grog it's true scanlan you are (laughing) and a cube incantation of isolation what is with this pencil it was dipped in ketchup or something but it needs to be sharpened do you remember the name of it i'm going to try casting locate object and cast it on the tome that contains the incantation of isolation try it why not i don't know oh really okay i'm going to kneel down and pray to the dawnfather since he was one of the ones that helped fight the chained oblivion to see if he could guide us at all or about the calamity or something i'm going to hop on my broom to see if i get a ping on my locate object wow you know that do any of the tomes have titles on them though i feel like celestial would be what the dawnfather would speak though i don't speak celestial so it doesn't really matter 21 does it seem like some are older than others okay was it pelor does pelor have a book i don't know why the incantation of isolation would be-- can i look at the bookbinding though do some books seem like they fall apart more that's cool go up and in here get on the broom scanlan we'll fly up let's go try to talk to one it's always good to lie pull out mythcarver and sing just sing like it's a microphone now ask now sing and question oh jesus i mean ioun we have an earring we're following the little surge of spectrals (singing) he's the chained oblivion his name is the chained oblivion keep telling the story 22 (whispers) i had a feeling it would be a locked bookcase (singing) can they open it up vax can you hear me i can try to pick it i can try my proficiency bonus yeah i got a one on your inspiration thanks for that but i rolled well so it doesn't matter hopefully 19 plus my dexterity modifier plus my proficiency bonus 30 no plus inspiration was 31 oh jeebies oh in god realm it will be harder that's the hardest lock i've ever picked i swear are any of the spectrals looking at one specifically can you do your ioun stone does it glow for anything in particular can i read any of them elvish common undercommon abyssal and draconic well i could potentially grab all of them and shove them in the bag of colding it seems pretty shitty dumping them out in a pile but i don't know what else to do i start grabbing other ones and putting them in the bag what can you do do you have a spell that lets you see things reveals things yeah sing to it or something you just keep singing i'll keep taking books we've got not enough time 25 books my locate object never pinged my incantation of isolation locate object oh shit i just grabbed a bunch of books but that's the one it's got to be keep looking at it while we're flying see if you can figure it out hold onto me though because we're going fast place mythcarver on it place mythcarver in it that was almost so bad 28 oh god can i hold onto his wrist to help out yeah what if you write in it and say hey i need the incantation of isolation did you cast friends on it did it work jesus oh god okay 27 don't you have suggestion what language is it are you sure something's there it's a small book it's the whole thing she's going to reappear obviously she knows we're here yeah we're at the bowl looking for change in the couch you're such a pain in the neck ma ugh you have a third eye we can learn what its vulnerabilities are on a success what does it say the dc is we literally stick the trammels onto vecna i have one no i have a stone yeah i'm going to can i pull out the little pearl of power how do we make a trammel we have a stone and we want more i assume in the ozmit sea scaldseat awesome oh my god you were a boot maker and now you're a weapon maker did it have a name you don't think do you have a seed of power (tongue click) i kiss him on the forehead oh i have your books i think they were really secret ones so i would hate to take those out of here take care darling i go up to percy are you all right dear where are we going they're pretty cool from the cabin to vasselheim pike you seem very quiet he's got a good beard i haven't seen it can i look too because we'd been fighting when we left so i'm going to make sure-- careful of traps they're still in place bear trap while he was doing that i want to stealth away with my brother for a moment and say i'm sorry about everything far enough that nobody can hear us jesus christ ten god damn it thank you thank you matt i deserved that that's karma oh okay i'm going to not move though because i don't want to step on another one of those fucking things yes thank you i didn't yeah i think so too i didn't plan it if i had i would have told you and then when i saw you it seemed like bad timing to say anything and then things kept happening (sighs) i know it was very spur-of-the-moment nobody was standing at our side except for each other i don't want you to go i love you we could i could die before you if she ever talks to me again i swear i will good call thank you thank you it's a seed of power grog i've got it grog i've got it stop manhandling scanlan because he doesn't like it we probably need to hurry maybe vasselheim why didn't we ask ioun about that is that the imp is he see-through i try to shoot an arrow at him no that's not cocked cocked 29 i fucking knew it thank you insight maybe who was it natural 20 thanks for double-checking it is like i would lie about a natural fucking 20 he's the god of secrets what do you expect when i say hey name your quote on the text thread then you send in a quote that means it's probably pretty solid i don't think you have that power i only serve gods with big dicks i wonder if he can see us in your dimension go to raven queen's temple right now maybe we can do the mansion outside of her temple we'll be in her temple we'll be fighting undead more than likely keep running they've got bigger things happening right now just keep running no what (laughter) keep running toward the raven queen temple as that's happening quickly quickly walk past understood i hold trinket back so that he doesn't go after him but i do think he's dead run where redbox maybe i think here i feel like we're safe here do you want to head over to kord's temple as well i have a feeling if we find him we'll have to go to another plane yeah i'll go i'll go with him yeah yeah that would be smart i feel like the mansion is the smartest thing because it's not-- we don't know vecna could still see in here as we're walking i want to whisper to scanlan i'm going to whisper to the meat man's crotch because that's about even right then i'll whisper to his waistline the sword that ioun was talking about right the sword of kas do you think it could possibly the sword that grog had do you know for sure well no but she didn't say it wasn't a talking sword she said it was a vengeful sword we really should have maybe we could ask the sword and we didn't but maybe if we see that sword we can be like hey do you know who kas is and if he does then we're like oh fuck i'm saying this quietly i don't want grog to realize we're doing this he has a thing for craven edge you did oh fuck oh shit continue you didn't pass the test anything delilah briarwood lord briarwood had the sword they were seeking vecna it could work out vecna doesn't have the sword right now-- exactly craven edge could be the sword of kas by the briarwoods they were going to awaken him but then he died or it's just a sword that just likes blood sorry grog yes of course we're walking we're doing this while we walk we're not wasting time with this conversation we're traveling with this conversation okay we sent it to the plane of the dread emperor we don't know where he is exactly-- (stammering) we've been speaking to the gods i'm going to stand next to grog while i say this yeah i'm going to fly down to the sandpit and land next to grog hi champion of pelor the dawnfather we've been speaking to the gods we're taking on vecna hopefully not alone but we need to speak with kord i know that sounds odd but grog was hoping-- laura and how long of a process is this that we're talking i'm not trying to rush faith i'm just saying that vecna has ascended to godhood we have a limited amount of time to take him down we need to speak with kord you can't speak to him directly maybe draw his attention to us the need is dire he's not okay yeah this is going to go so well hold up 20 maybe you can tell him there's a big fight coming call out to him get his attention yeah say he can help take down the big bad guy definitely prime tickets to a ufc fight east guard he is god east guard is that near the fields of elysium or a totally different place right yeah so you have nothing else that you can do i know that you're going to fight his troops but the fact of the matter is vecna is a god if we can't find some way to speak to kord we may not be able to save the world again powerful beans super (laughs) he hasn't looked at us this whole fucking time you have everything you've ever wanted grog congratulations can i see what he was drawing in the sand while we were over there 18 groon if vecna attacks here he'll bring undead he's really creepy isn't he back away good job grog yeah he's in ysgard he's-god lovely can i have light blue hair no i want beautiful hair i've always wanted blue hair oh shit it's the temple of bahamut yes i really hope vasselheim stands there could be an actual seed of power within there i'll look over his shoulder and help look i'm going to help look that's not bad well it's a bean with a dick percy with your migraine do you know what else we need to make these trammels (gasps) platinum mines so we know where they are we need more platinum well i didn't write exactly how much platinum we have i transposed the platinum into gold in my notes we could go to the bank here in vasselheim and switch out money for platinum we have enough gold to do it's 500 platinum each you said 5000 gold would be 500 platinum okay well we need to not lose they're still diminished if we do defeat vecna that part of them is forever chaining him right as far as we know do you know who it could be of course it matters dear at least we'd know if he raised them up like he said he did if we'll be fighting undead gilmore and undead allura can we scry through this dimension funny you should ask allura has it allura has it sure and allura came down and saw it-- no i gave it to allura i'm sorry grog i gave you your deck of cards back the skull was very dangerous and at the time it seemed like the right thing to do i'm sorry i'm sorry look we just went and got a bunch of beans for you i don't believe if you'd freed it you would've gotten a wish i think you would've fought something no we need to scry on the fucking friends we need to check in on that skull maybe and you need to maybe open up the plane to the dread emperor and see about the craven edge is it what if that weapon is super good against vecna no kas is destroyed he turned to ash he fought vecna and was turned to ash he fought against vecna they destroyed each other it's the reason vecna was destroyed to begin with (whispering) please please please please please just go just scry well allura has the skull do we have any way to talk to her can you scry on the object no oh my god can you scry on tary what if he came searching for us she might be in the colding let's get into the mansion and talk to her let's go in the mansion first the door's open we're talking through the door oh that's a good one solid question the shadow knight does she have to answer do they have to answer oh shit she's already been brought back she's a necromancer and be sneaky about it okay i hate him so much what's going on you're outside of the mansion come in the mansion he knows we'll lead him anywhere darling she'll remove it soon enough can you plane shift us from here from the mansion taliesin and is that a 9th-level spell as awful as it is we need to sleep if we can't fight him in the morning or anytime things yeah that's smart immune to poison we have two chalices bank in the morning then off fabulous shall we rest up an angel you've seen it
