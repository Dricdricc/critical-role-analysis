i'm going to ask the grand maven flying is that sort of weird here or is that totally okay on a broom maybe i don't want to do anything that's wrong here i feel like i might be able to see it percy point me in the direction i'll fly and get it can i fly i feel like i could fly down and get it point me in the direction hold tight percy i'm holding onto one of his wrists as i'm flying no percy you're totally fine i throw up too because anytime i-- i'm going to keep my hand on your wrist percy i'm going to try this fancy little dice here this is a one i'm going to blame it on matt abernathy thanks for that opal dice yeah he got opal dice and it-- okay that's okay 13 perception damn it i zone in and i notice that i accidentally puked a little bit on percy's head and that completely distracts me that's got a tiny bit of puke on the top of his head and i feel so bad i can't focus on what you're saying and i throw up again because it's so gross to see you were so smart with your math and i-- someone is going to find a really expensive weapon oh no no i hope not and the mystery it will just be unsolved mysteries they'll never know they're going have a documentary on making a murderer sorry percy i'm so sorry no but it was your hair that i threw up on i mean and i take some-- you know if you hadn't thrown up to begin with this would have never happened man i rolled a one [break] what time is it i'm going to use another spell and heal myself some more you do that's still that's potentially ten extra hit points what's the codeword i have a question do you really think this is a smart move considering that a brass dragon just gave us our aid and asked us not to fuck anything up all right we're cool scanlan we're cool oh they are what if they find it on you give it to us if anyone comes and tries to take you away we'll present it and say that we're higher rank we've seen you turn into a triceratops and fuck things up we trust you scanlan well we know it happened seen the tale throughout the mansion love-a the spice huh are you sure this is even a drug did you say what the spice was all right you'll do a wonderful job you're so cool should we get in fancy casino clothes because i feel like we'd dress up for it is it shaped like a pyramid with a giant light coming out the top no i cannot wait yes can we get changed do we have enough time awesome clothes for casino we are hitting the club we're making it hail now it looks like you've been sweating a lot you look so cool keyleth can you glamor me to not look like i have a giant slash through my chest anymore no well i guess i'm walking by myself oh percy do you want to look like you have ladies so rich all right and then me and keyleth are on percy's arms wow stealthing like a motherfucker what does that mean okay i understand already i'm looking for craps is that a one oh no keyleth don't get arrested again that was really cool keyleth i'm not putting any money on thordak i'm going to put 25 on the second one that doesn't have any bets the one that you said hasn't-- 25 gold as well all right no i don't want to look like i'm putting down the minimum that's pathetic 25 gold you've got to spend big to make big percy oh that's adorable go underdog natural one do i get anything for second place it takes everything in my power not to keep betting but we should probably walk away as we walk around we keep an eye out for scanlan's red shirt yeah i want to use my gold dice this game yes that i can't actually remember what you said the rules were so what's the minimum bet okay and then you add you can double your bet to add-- okay then i'm going to put 25 down just to see how it goes okay here we go oh i'm marking okay what am i rolling 2d6 you got it where's my other of my life they're gold dice they're the gold dice eight oh god this is a hard game you lose really easily to get to 12 all right i'm going to double my bet and i'm going to throw one more dice in the -- 50 gold yes aw it was almost a four it was a five no it's fine it's really super-duper fun he didn't even look ooh 50 gold back you should try it again you've made money now you should i tip her two extra gold because that's what you're supposed to do did we see him walking up the stairs 15 is the gambling only at the first level or is it up higher levels as well i think i'll after a little bit grab a drink and then-- yeah what was it what does it look like the cedar wood chips oh you rolled really well it's a spice oh shit oh no i'm going to down mine really fast and then take another one to go thanks let's go back to the rooms come on let's go back to the room and do some experiments on it yes grog we head back to the hotel to the inn let's set it on fire and see what happens it looks like wood does it taste like it would be good on a sandwich i don't know grog can i walk downstairs and find the innkeeper hey treev hi i'm looking for a meal i'm a little homesick i'm hoping you have a meal that maybe has some fusaka in it oh it is a pricey spice yeah right of course it wouldn't do anything to your body if you had too much of it would it probably right tell you what i'm going to save the money i think i'll hold off on the fusaka for tonight but maybe later thank you here's the thing he said it's an expensive spice maybe it was worth however much you spent on it tell me how much you spent on this oh 50 gold that's a lot but i think it should be fine you can make 50 gold back betting in the casino later they said it could make your stomach upset if you've had too much
