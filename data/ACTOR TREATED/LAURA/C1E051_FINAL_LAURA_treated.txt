in the store oh wait but it has to switch they're for pre-order for another week there's like modeling happening right now and then i know there was modeling these european models are in these smoking hot-- oh who these european models let's do it oh my gosh alright folks let's go ahead and bring us down back into tonight's episode of critical role (spooky ethereal music) (heavy breathing) (roaring) (dramatic music) (gun firing) welcome back so last we left off the party having found their way back to the city of westruun which had been overrun by the herd of roving nomadic tribal barbarians and other such brigands that wander the landscape of talâ€™dorei that grog once belonged to had swooped in and taken westruun after the chroma conclave dragon attack across this countryside the party had devised a plan to find their way into the town or at least one of them would distract a cluster of these individuals these goliaths many of which are you know half-giant goliaths pulling them out of the city into a large pit that had been hidden after being carved by the druid keyleth scanlan went into be the distraction becoming invisible leaping to the center of the main town square right in front of the margrave's house where apparently the leader of this clan kevdak which has a long history with grog resides as part of this distraction scanlan released a thunderwave and in doing so unknowingly also revealed himself as the invisibility spell went away and an entire cluster of very angry-looking individuals bared down on him managed to escape thanks to dimension door twice and made your way into the partially ruined temple of arathis where you came face to face with a number of refugee westruun villagers and dr dranzel and kaylee and that is where we left off so after appearing and having a moment of realizing the scenario you see a handful of people most of them filthy completely beleaguered and in need of not being in this circumstance as long as they possibly can and you can see kaylee kinda holding them back defensively and dranzel having just noticed your appearance and calling out to you with a chuckle realizing that you're here and kaylee rolling her eyes apparently unable to really escape through fate though there is a look a brief glance of appreciation that at least you're not burnt to a crisp somewhere outside emon but dranzel walks up to you and is like as hush as he can be scanlan so glad to see that you survived what are you doing here oh man i love this so much there's a moment of quiet (laughing) i just hope that works dr dranzel walks by (chuckles) i have to say you two make quite the team i would say that as well yes i would thank you kaylee that was better than i could have ever done that's true all right then so we're getting people out of here things have gone a bit up how are we gonna get the rest of these folks out and dranzel thinks for a second he goes well we can't wait for the rest of the team they're probably still on their way back from kymal i've unfortunately mostly spent my capabilities for the day scanlan what do you got to keep us all safe no to get the rest of these poor saps out out of the city jesus uh were you gonna leave them here unguarded oh no of course i'm not gonna leave them unguarded i just i mean we can't how many people are here you look around the room there's nine people i can get me and kaylee out (laughing) i think we should just hunker down (laughs) i can't get us out i'm sorry i mean we could sneak we could sneak we could try to make a sneak for it are there sewers here kaylee nods there are sewers aye close by is there an entrance nearby about two blocks that way and she points to the south side of the city okay you're birds we're with everybody else i'm gonna take a minute to-- anybody standing near me i'm gonna take a minute and use um where's my thing i'm freaking out hide in plain sight anybody coming out all right all right so as part of that i'll have you guys both roll stealth checks okay so add 10 to that 35 oh see that's what we could do matt we could've just sat you on the same side of the table as us yeah you could've been behind us and also pre-order for another week i don't know man also also the necklaces and the keychains are still there necklaces and keychains but those are a fantastic birthday or christmas gift the necklaces we still haven't gotten to those arbor day seems like a good-- memorial day memorial day people give gifts on memorial day i got gifts on memorial day yeah so underneath your memorial day tree this year it's cute it's like steel all right oh my gosh so hopefully he wasn't captured there's about six coming this way so stay down hopefully the trap works i just thought of something hey remember when we were like walking through the woods and we fought those six goliaths and i stopped the fight remember yeah that was zanror right right so i think he knows that i'm not like back from the dead well shit grog i know i just thought of it you know like the whole magic thing might not actually work so the whole plan we made was stupid no no no i'm just saying let's move forward you're using your father right your father is dead right your dad's dead yeah he's dead where are they where are they i also want to just see if i recognize i'm just doing another little flippity-flop scan around and i just want to see if i recognize his brother as one of the people who's coming to the gate or not i'll get down low for that not a brother per se you're a bird well i was gonna say i can drop as soon as he lands i drop his polymorph as soon as he lands landing on the other ones six hide in plain sight technically yeah i'll let it happen 'cause it's part of the surprise round we'll say this is all happening simultaneously they fall in grasp then they catch themselves and then the blade comes out of nowhere so yeah i'll let that happen 18 19 oh shit i should've done that 30 awesome great work that was sick tiny that blade there he's putting it down he's putting it down that is a huge chasm we're watching his magic in real life where's all the dead bodies at the bottom of it yeah can you draw detailed dead bodies (laughing) can you just grade it a little bit hiding pike would be off to the side here he's strong yeah pit of despair the pit of despair haven't bullrushed in a while okay make sure i forgot that was proper (jumbled excited chatter) 9700 feet specifically all of them all the feet or prone prone is good kick him kick him no 29 oh my god those are so many 5 10 15 50 56 56 oh fail come on grog come on grog 16 ew i'm sorry i'm sorry people but you know i care about you all right all right it's not going to stop me from trying to hate you away but i get what you're saying well do your trick okay so i cast seeming on the lot and i make a few orcs and a few humans any number of creatures within 30 feet of you so all of these westruun peasant folk yourself dr dranzel and kaylee all of a sudden become to varying sized degrees-- i can make people a foot taller taller yeah so like they can be somewhat larger you're still-- you guys are still tiny little goblinoid half-orcs but it gives a visual perspective based on what you've seen of this troop and everyone kind of looks at themselves looking at the back of their hands there's this one kind of younger man in his mid-teens he's like this is amazing (grunts) and they're also making the noises at each other like for a brief moment all of the fear subsides as they're for the moment getting into the play of acting like a half-orc and then they all get serious again and look to you and kaylee and kaylee goes all right then follow me too many guys as he turns around and goes to walk away he (laughing) falls face first asleep on the ground on the outside of the alleyway just (thuds) halfway in the sun of the main thoroughfare kaylee runs up real fast and grabs his ankles and drags him i try to help go go go i don't know the ways through the sewers you have to go lead them not me (sighs) she drops the leg down i start dragging him you guys start dragging him off the side and you guys quickly go dart in as you all jump inside dranzel grabs the grate top he gets down behind it-- right before he closes it i step out i step out and i say take them to safety bring them outside the city hide stay safe all right same goes for you scanlan well i'll do my best yeah you will and he pulls it down screws it into place to where it feels kind of taut and you are now on your own outside of this area with a sleeping individual as his snoring slowly subsides he starts rousing from his slumber about a minute later rubbing his chin what do you do while he was still asleep i was booking it towards the western gate away from him stelth check 18 okay all right so the rest of you guys at this point in time what's the plan guys i'm heading in towards the city do we have a report yet keyleth i'm getting nervous about scanlan did you see scanlan then we should-- i did not see scanlan let's head towards the center of town they might have him held prisoner because we're fucking morons i didn't know he was going to go that far eh shitballs another one's taking a cheap shot at you towards you roll initiative everybody who's gonna have anything to do with this right now oh i'm getting in on this shit too 24 sarenrae blesses you 17 12 for keyleth okay 17 on the first hit yeah as you release the first arrow wings are up giant sharp beak extended its claws in the air the arrow sinks into its body but it still kind of just shakes it off continuing going into a further dive toward you its wings outward oh no a little elf puddle do it percy i'm gonna i'm gonna not only am i gonna take a shot-- good job good job guys 12 ew accordioned in like the body does it appear to be any druid related to the ashari clan looking it over make an investigation check can i join in i was gonna join in up there can't you just sit on the broom with me what is going on are grog and pike and i just supposed to stand over here by the gate are you guys gonna head off i thought we were all going in i mean we had a plan and then we didn't have a plan so we have like wait but the earrings oh wait i can hear yes yes ooh (laughing) thank you i forgot about that uh yeah hey hi oi guys oi oi you know what we killed nine of them oh shit that's us all right can we all convene in an alley you do you convene in an alley within the next few minutes a little bit of a confusing telephone bit going back and forth but you do eventually gather at this time you guys do hear what sounds like some voices shouting about a block and a half up the way yeah oh my god you don't even look like yourself i look pretty cool what about our darkvision can we see anything in there no even if your darkvision you guys see as well there's nothing inside the building appears to be vacant you wasted it on a window lovely six left grog then six seriously that's pretty much all my plans are always jeez to the center of town maybe we go to his house first he's your grandfather it's all going down we can do that after we stealth around the second we start attacking they will start killing so he walks in on his own challenges kevdak to a duel yeah look-- on your own so it'll go like this everybody get high vantage points so i walk in i'm pretty sure if i call him out he'll step aside and we'll do this thing if it starts going poorly i leave it to your discretion or if other people start getting iffy with the civilians we can start taking shots i know i can drop a few before they do anything i've burned both of my wild shaping abilities for right now unless we wanted to take a brief rest to regain our thoughts this is sort of a brief rest is this considered like a short rest no a short rest is like a half an hour to an hour of like intentional-- we can afford it we can take that i am too they can leave when they want they can come and go as they please so it's not like a roach motel no vex can capture one of them well that's good grog what if i lend you my boots which when you put your heels together will also help your armor out a bit or help your chances of being hit helps me attack faster you can give them back to me tomorrow and i can give you enhanced constitution no no i've learned that my strength is with my friends and my friends have their own strengths to each their own i don't want you all handicapping yourself for me i would like to change out my braces of defense to get a +2 to my ac for the gauntlets of ogre strength okay so your strength is now a 17 you take a +2-- nice not concentration anything else you want to cast no ish i cast pass without a trace on us so we can stealth all right so the rest of you go ahead and make your stealth check what percy are you going to the rooftop all right both of you guys roll acrobatics checks we'll just say as a continuation of this natural one it might have been a seven but i thought it was a one well regardless you guys get but 30 feet before (thud) (laughing) vex you suffer eight points of damage as you plummet off-- perfect all right nice that's pretty cool at which point the spell fades as the life force of this halfling no longer holds sway and the body just crumples into a pile can we loot the bodies of course you say that before we move forward all right how about on the thing i killed anything can i keep the whip if you want to okay you take the whip and wrap it up real fast and kind of just attach it inside of your belt oh it did it burned i'm sorry no it's all right all right you guys move on a little bit further towards a t portion of the street where you can now see there's a cart in the center and what looks to be a number of other goliaths are currently pulling two individuals out of their homes and kind of starting to drag them back towards the top of the t intersection where you guys are passing from as you get to that point there's a little bit of noise coming that way you hear another clank and a shh from behind you in an alley just around the way and the elf behind you has been walking quietly stops and goes all rright something not right is going on at this moment he turns around you hold here goliath no i don't think i will but i tell you what you make the choice walk me to kevdak or go check out your little spook fest he looks over to the other companion go ahead and gather those men have them follow you into the alley then the other individual walks towards the alley and starts talking to the other goliaths they go ahead and take some of the people that they're holding by the arms lift them up over their shoulder and you now have roughly six individuals four of which are goliath now joining up for a total of seven and they're all heading back towards the ally way no i'm sorry because i'm an asshole he probably has a magic vault dammit the thought hits you immediately the memory of like oh that's right as you tumble through a sequence of small boxes your distraction caught you off guard and you weren't paying attention where you were walking briefly before you just fall face first into kind of a mushy mud puddle and kind of stand up and look shh no (laughter) around the corner the group steps into the alleyway as this little poof of purple energy and smoke quickly dissipates and they all spin looking to the way they glance about step in to begin to inspect spend a few moments one of them goes up to where the barrels had fallen over just kind of pokes looks into the mud can see some depressions in the mud there's something following us come on and they all begin to swarm into the alleyway all seven of them you guys are you going are you backing up further into the alley are you trying what are you doing i 34'ed up to the-- oh god ew he steps forward with this kind of thick kind of a almost like a moss-like crust that just kind of has gathered under his neck and he's called greenbeard because of this weird whatever infection or ailment he had caused this kind of moss-type material to grow across his neck and chest area and he kind of comes forward using his walking stick this kind of gnarled branch that he uses and is it really you strongjaw i see your eye still serves you well you know when zanror told us that he came across you up north we beat the shit out of him for being a liar you should have beat the shit out of him for being a coward he begged me to let him go really well seems we know at least who's caused all the commotion recently dead man walking through town by himself into the belly of the beast so men take his head he steps back as about seven other goliaths from up behind and two longbow individuals in the far end go ahead and draw arrows and begin to notch them back i take a beat oh jeez that's hilarious the spikes are facing inward tight tight tight tight tight tight are we around can we see any of this stealthily i'm feel guilty for getting in a fight with my brother right before i got up on the rooftop kevdak just grew is there a roof in this area can i take trinket out of the - if you'd like to yeah do you want to your call jesus i would like to rage the rage of my rage-y life (laughter) and i would like to use intimidating presence on kevdak okay don't say that what oh and you have inspiration that's right while all the attention is focused on them can i stealth down to the ground for a second i just want to duck can i just duck in the building at least is that part of the stealth oh come on as you pull kevdak actually lifts you up off the ground holding the ax up to his face and just goes like father like son and shakes you off well doesn't even shake you off just butts you off of the ax and you skid to the ground take one point of bludgeoning damage no big deal land on the ground you don't fall prone but you're there and can probably grab your war hammer and pick it back up if you want to if you need it what's stone's endurance it's just a d12 which is a 12 plus my constitution so that's 17 so as the blow comes you just take it right to the center of the chest as it hits it barely cuts in before you go ahead and grab and deflect it with your hand doing no damage to you whatsoever however the impact of it though-- make a strength saving throw with advantage again 18 18 however the sheer force of trying to deflect it does push you back 15 feet right on the edge there we'll say you're right there that's fine and you stop right at the edge of another edge of the spikes and there are two goliaths that are there with their weapons out just forcing you back into the ring if you decide to back up any further and with that kevdak's going to go ahead and move forward and push you into that corner that's going to end his turn you're up i'm going to look at kevdak and drop my arms to my side oh my god-duh let's wait let's wait what's the general consensus say i have to shoot tomorrow the general consensus is it's 11 pm and we're keeping the crew here as well dude
