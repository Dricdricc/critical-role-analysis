saying into my ear where are you what's going on i guess running towards the briarwoods' room as i'm running towards the briarwoods' room i start shouting uriel and grab a servant and say go find uriel tell him there's enemies within the gates in the castle now seeker start rolling different dice but we know he's in the room that's where we're all heading can i use hunter's mark and sense where lady briarwood is at that moment i take off running in that direction i hadn't rolled actually for that i hadn't rolled initiative yet 18 can i use my earring during that i tell keyleth and tiberius that i think they are outside the palace walls yeah you do can i ask a question trinket i didn't say i left him at home did he wait outside of the palace during the formal dinner but he would have stayed outside at the palace right seeker awesome seeker's turn and sylas got to take a turn right as i get outside-- i would whistle but vex can whistle and she whistles for trinket no but i whistle for him he knows to listen for it yes i scream can i attack okay if i did something that did five feet-- ten feet i've got to look at this yeah ten feet if i hit lady briarwood would that hit my brother or would that just hit bastard briarwood fuck it i'm doing it lightning arrow right at her face well that's wedged natural 20 what do i do times two so it was 32 damage on her and then everybody within ten feet has to make a dex save not him he's not in it and i hunter's marked her fuck one oh good then 2d8 for them nine and then times two because it was critical 18 and i get another attack though yes okay then i'm going to attack her through my blazing bowstring natural 20 again (cheering) yes of course it is okay eight plus seven is 15 plus two for bracers so that's 17 times two is 34 plus hunter's mark damage which is another fucking six 38 damage no no it is 40 damage she's on fire i should say what the blazing bowstring does huh an additional d10 of damage for that would that have been part of the part that was multiplied by two another six for that yeah fuck that dress okay okay yeah okay cool 15 no wait 17 then maybe you don't want to go first you can
