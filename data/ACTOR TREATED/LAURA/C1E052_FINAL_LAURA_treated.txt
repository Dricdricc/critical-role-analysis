leeloo dallas multipass sorry matt you were talking i think may is world of warcraft dbz it's got all these amazing things and i was like i'm a part of all of these things and i want it well it's not really hot right now it's amazing yeah she's a villain so you get to face off with her it's really fun that's right i remember when we were going in for multiplayer it was like we've got several members of vox machina as the multiplayer characters which is pretty ridiculous although i did get made fun of already some fan pointed out that i looked stupid (fake cries) it was sam it was you matt it was you did you just do that at home with a-- 27 oh god oh god oh god oh god does the second story of the house that i'm in have windows can i see can i run up the stairs then so i can get a better look at the playing field okay i'm going to-- i'm already hiding right okay then i'm going to hunter's mark kevdak and i'm going to hold my turn-- i'm going to hold my turn until it seems like he's better incapacitated or until something happens i'm going to hold my turn i think until scanlan goes no he didn't that's why you shook your fucking head what is his attack fucking bonus seven overall plus two necrotic on the first hit five necrotic on the second plus that would be giving away your hiding oh god for hold person does it un-paralyze him if we hit him yay me too but i was in front of you oh five feet damn it oh but that's good for grog okay i'm going to go yes yes i'm going to shoot from my longbow of the sky sentinel so that's three attacks on the first attack okay so so 19 plus 12 probably hits on the first attack okay 19 plus 12 hits on the second and 17 plus 12 hits on the third okay i'm adjusting my glasses i'm so nervous okay 28 on the first hit 21 on the second hit 16 on the third hit oh but i get another attack because that's just one attack my second attack i'm going to take at greenbeard and i'm going to shoot through the flaming bowstring 17 plus 12 probably hits 17 plus 12 okay gah 14 on that one i hunter's marked he's hunter's marked already not at all hunter's mark i did it i swear oh yeah you did the clicking the boots of haste already that's it that's it that top one that one yeah oh my god he's going to shoot his arm off c'mon pike oh yeah you can still do other things this is a bonus you're going to roll roll for it i can't even read that oh no seriously pike they're all coming for you scanlan would it say 'reaction' here unless he's unconscious okay if i aim an arrow it's at disadvantage okay i'm going to cast i'm going to cast-- okay here's my question the siege arrow that percy gave me is that a magical weapon or a technical weapon so just structures so it wouldn't harm people not anything crazy i know i know i know i know okay okay okay okay i'm going to cast hail of thorns at third level into a group the group at kevdak just do it i'm going to do it at kevdak and anything that is close to him gets hit anything-- at level three natural 20 oh 3d10 oh 20 plus an additional-- oh no hunter's mark dropped because it's a concentration but i am sneaking-attacking an additional six oh that's 12 then because it doubles the dice so that's 32 points of damage 15 15 with inspiration they're barbarians as well if i fly on my broom can i go down and grab pike as an action i mean as a movement okay i'm going to stay where i am and i'm going to hide against the window so nobody can see me against on-- yeah like that looking up her windskirts nice percy he knocks down a tree in the process pathetic that's not bad that's not bad natural one natural one she's really little oh that's the one you pushed off the roof oh my god (singing) natural crit but you double your dice because it's a natural crit because he's five feet away no just your dice double your dice does he shrink dammit teeny tiny math math is fun you could pick it up but can you put it in the bag of holding i know i can't tell if it's actually really warm in here or if we're all just really hot yeah he's gross he's got mold on his neck up in their business oh it fell anyway it happened you got your spiritual weapon still oh that's good don't you add anything to it 4d8 do you add the spell attack bonus to it times two plus four that's actually way more organized than i thought it would be oh god what i thought you said the first one was a crit that's not concentration it doesn't do anything shit shit oh my god this is where it all turns no how many people are there i feel like there's so many more people than there were why are you doing this to pike stop hurting her why did it all turn because he can roll acrobatics just like we can okay he's attacking percy oh oh no come on scanlan oh thank god okay i'm going to fly out of the window on the broom out of the window i'm going to fly down and i'm going to shout grog raise your arm and i'm going to go down and i'm going to hit his hand with the pokeball i'm above i want to be high up in the air but low enough that i can reach down and touch the locket to grog's hand i know i know wait all of them can attack but i'm in the air with the locket and i hit i don't hand it to him i'm putting grog in the fucking locket i want to fly by and poof and keep going it's a wisdom save but if it's a willing person they can go in and i want to fly on past and go up to the next roof where should i go where should i go i'm going to fly back into the-- i'm going to fly around the back of the big building yeah okay hits it did what'd you what'd you give me oh that's right she gave me a blessing oh okay it's my armor class fuck balls shit mother bitch okay okay okay dammit okay great cool great i'm fine and i'm just going to keep going okay that-- yeah oh my god ermagerd four right oh god we're going to we're all going to die once we kill him his gauntlets are going to be there we have to go in and get his gauntlets what 15 hits you we're fine we're okay we're okay i'm going to start crying he kicks the hammer oh the spiritual weapon they're all clustered right there if you have something that does area well greenbeard can probably heal kevdak scanlan don't hurt the innocents surprise attack would've been really good on these guys god fuck all of them that was the first thing we killed in this fight that is terrible two peasants dead that's true like up and over would probably be better yeah if you're within five feet of him he doesn't attack (laughs) every time oh no sorry grog i was trying to keep you from dying no shit greenbeard he heals 70 extra hit points oh not 70 percent of his hit points we can still take him we can still take him don't let him get the gauntlets percy in the kill box you're going into the kill box wait what this is heroic death music right now (laughs) he's saying 'asshole asshole asshole' we're all breaking that's good what if we all die and the dragons take over everything you're a barmaid everything's bad unless they've got a red ring around them sorro what are you rolling what is the damage that's a lot all tens but now he's a tank greenbeard's an earth elemental an archer died they're all burning to death slowly can you see me up in the air can you see me in the air i'm a barbarian and one of them would get an opportunity now because-- you can do it pike what why that's good that's good oh no was that the little kid there's so many they all get to go falls right back down like some other loser that i know of no he's a scrapper he's dodgy no we didn't save anybody and we killed ourselves okay i'm going to fly over right above kevdak like a good 50 feet all right i'm going to pokeball grog right out so he can attack straight out of the gate just like i would cannonball trinket can this be my bonus so i'm dropping him out is the bonus and then i still can attack i mean it's only a locket it's not like it's a whole move okay no then they all get advantages against you again does that mean he gets the three 12s again and then double that his crits don't get double who's next oh i'm still going it's still my turn oh my god i mean my only option to heal him is to land and touch him well fuck it i'm going to land and touch grog i don't know do i have that somewhere oh wait wait i couldn't do anything else okay then i guess i'm going to stay where i am and-- jeez can i hold my action i'm going to hold my action until-- yeah i'm going to hold my action until grog is healed and i-- can i shout anything i'm going to shout witness grog strongjaw and bend the knee natural 20 (yelling and cheering) no i hit i hit but it was it was a 20 i swear but we are so going to loot that if we survive this come on come on come on can i take a healing potion while they're inside i'm up on the thing kind of like when you're eating lobster to get the claw out yeah no it's a fucking natural 20 but why does it only happen when it's a story element oh let me take a picture i'll take a picture yeah yeah i'm going to land and i'm going to call trinket out because things happened so fast for him and there were really strong people does it turn him into a zombie or does it-- okay yeah do that i'll help hey you already boxed up your stuff that's good she was assisting i was helping with the money that's lovely i cast grasping vine and lift him up by the neck where's your mother child was she here in the square with you okay well we'll help you find your family and maybe while we're there we can see if your grandfather's around i lift him up and put him on trinket so we can start walking is there anything else to loot off of kevdak gauntlets (sings) bag of holding flayed bear tattoo got it nice i'm putting that down who's these two oh okay (laughs) bowing down like he's been knighted oh shit you're right i mean do we have to stay in the square or are we allowed to okay i feel like we should return this little boy to his family and see if we can find your grandpa i can't believe we're not all dead on trinket we didn't die i seriously thought we were all going to die when he got healed and everything was running-- oh my god getting his arms off him brilliant this was incredibly stressful yeah so i'm glad we split them up getting grog out oh god is he good job matthew mercer
