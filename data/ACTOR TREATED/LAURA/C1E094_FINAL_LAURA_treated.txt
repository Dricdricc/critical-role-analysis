your list nice i'm really excited to hear it that was beautiful that was-- yes just the smallest of questions though the amount that you wrote down would we be seeing that before you cut off ties right yeah i mean we may be here for a while wouldn't it be fun though to just set up shop here and hang out-- yeah yeah yeah that's how you could make some money maybe tinker for a living yeah thereabouts a lot of money that is true taryon you are a pretty boy well you know you could make a new doty maybe a smaller doty just to brush hair that's right get a little funsy action there yeah yeah that's good no but seriously though the money situation though like really you are paying-- no but you know you always said you pay your debts and all that so you have some so i just wanted to make sure that that's actually happening no because i feel really bad for you i feel bad about everything and i'm pretty happy for you for being your own man and all of that i just want to make sure that-- i can keep track of it for you gladly doubtful what did you get wait what did you add what did you add to him five and five what does that mean i thought you said you had a lot of money (laughter) because i'm completely out of character okay no no i wasn't vex then i didn't read any of that that's my favorite yeah well go get 'em they'll be happy to have you that's wonderful do you need any help with that we feel a bit of responsibility for them any time sorry we couldn't do more grayskull is still there yeah yeah that's pretty awkward let's go get him laid i get on my broom and continue the journey hi we didn't even see you oh my god we went to hell really it probably would have been-- like you would have gone evil-evil that's true you would have been really hot in your armor percy ate a soul percy signed a contract with a devil you go to hell you sign a contract selling his soul we did we did she scries she sees shit we're about to get some alcohol do you want to join us all the carts yeah important business of state yeah it's really important you're so strong that's right you could beat me in an arm wrestling match they're huge oh i'm so sorry taryon lost his best friend the big creepy robot that drew us yeah yeah yeah we'll find somebody good super super good here we know gilmore he flirts really good okay right okay yeah ooh okay too muscly too bald too much body odor which one got it so someone more like keyleth would be along-- someone lithe and sculpted oh that was really uncomfortable yeah or i want to mate with you that's probably bad as well that's okay that's all right that's good all right cool that's good yeah that's good rejection rejection rejection what does she look like you've got a good shot over there with that-- she's a female we really do that sounds really good did she just boop you on the nose she booped-- i know he got booped oh my i'm not trying to-- no it's still the same thing then you pay your debt to us yeah he likes buckets i feel like us at the table should actually get to rate the come ons the females should get to rate these ooh she got some experience what i mean if you're pursuing like a flowery lady-- -- who's never met a real man in her life i'd be honest flowery would work too much it's too much dear yeah just don't just-- just right out this is going to work so much better oh shit you're going to lose your jug that's fucked up oh god disadvantage oh yeah definitely higher than 20 maybe talk to them don't talk at them talk to them don't talk at them (laughs) no that's a question for me darling that's so true i think the lesson went well tonight how many more things on that list tary woof what for there were really terrible people there people were being tortured we saw it happen oh we saw a torture chamber you would have loved it i thought of you no i almost did and i felt really weird about it yeah a werebear trinket was-- i think he had a bit of a crush trinket did you have a crush on tova oh yeah look at you asking questions was it with doty no it's not judging it was a terrible joke he's got really good technique he always brings a bottle of liquor with him wait what what how much older was he than you terrible we should find lawrence we should see if we can find him we should scry on him nothing can you describe him would it work real estate you don't want to be that i got you boo well shit tary you don't have to go back to him if you don't want to you can stay with us i don't fully agree with that you did give it away i think grog's offering oh do you go to brothels pike trish the dish you see how she did that i mean unless you want you if that's the way you think you're going to pick up a girl or a guy maybe that's the way and you'll just find somebody who likes that you might get a lot of rejection until that point but eventually you'll find the person that it registers with you're doing great i know you did are you okay do you still was it a little painful you could he's not going to be into it could we get an insight if taryon seemed excited or just terribly scared that's better than what i rolled not happy not happy at all or like cool this is so uncomfortable to talk about you could always try following them i'm going to go make sure everything's okay i'm going to go listen in and make sure everything's okay no of course not (gasps) oh you sneaky fuck no yeah he's not going to know where we went is shauna around at all can i run up and snag her for a second i feel like it happened it definitely happened question though how long does your friend usually stay with her cohorts does it-- is it-- does she spend the night with them or is it like an in and out-- do you see her again around quickly it depends on the guy i agree with that sentiment thank you for your generosity and your connections also i'm sorry for my friends and for me (laughter) thank you i dunno i think he might be with her a long time he might be learning a few things it could take all night i mean did it look like he was really really far in for keyleth actually gross i like this plan yes do i need to come with you you didn't did you not see anything what did you do you seemed bothered after you looked is everything all right what was he doing what was he doing like what i sort of gave that to him i did yes you don't think there's any chance he'll ever come back do you you know it's funny he left feeling like we didn't appreciate his worth and these last few weeks have really made me understand how much i did i think he hit on a lot of really good points when he left us i don't forgive him for them just yet but i'm trying not to hate him for it not at all dear i pull out fenthras and i show him again what i've carved on the front of it sinaeth do you remember when i told you about this it's important i struggle with it a lot you know i tend to hold grudges if we're trying that's important just think on it nothing rash dear all right yeah i'll be in the room i ran to jared's marisha and jarett yes i have no idea of the responsibilities in fact i have no idea what being a lady really means except for saying i'm a lady every once in a while oh have all the answers all right so i'm like a guard destroyer of worlds what kind of creatures are we talking beholder creatures or big wolf-type creatures all right yeah that's no problem i'm really tough and strong and stuff so yeah that sounds fine when was the last one oh oh just me matt and what about trinket even keyleth got friends no vex obviously i mean i'm going to kick serious butt but what if i don't what happens then do i lose my title do i just suck forever what right when that could-- so wait has the opportunity presented itself now okay wonderful well i'm not intimidated by this at all great great yeah it's fine by myself no big deal no big deal this is nothing right you're not going to send me out there to die percy thanks tary look at you you're so strong and knowledgeable now all right sure yeah great well i shove a bunch of eggs in my mouth and i get up and i'm going to find keeper yennen then hi vex'ahlia lady vex'ahlia grand mistress of the grey hunt apparently which i'm here to talk to you about apparently oh i thought that happened last night dear okay okay that's it huh yeah this explains so much it's very clear so i'm supposed to bring back some sort of trophy then that would be good right right right all right well thank you keeper thank you and you and you the dawnfather's pelor right great so i'm going to go and sit in front of a tree i'm going to think real hard i'm going to talk to a god and then i'm going to go kill something potentially looking good tary looking good well fuck it i remember you doing that i like this technically i'm supposed to be at the base of the tree right what if pelor can't see underground what if he needs to see me in the sun i don't know how gods work i don't know solid i'm just going to walk towards the tree (laughter) she's going to stay yes did you want to say something percy i give him a big hug and a kiss i love you dear thank you all right get the fuck away from me i've got to meditate i feel itchy but i'm okay i'm going to stay still okay he said i'm supposed to meditate on the tree or on pelor i'm going to try thinking about the tree first a lot i'm thinking about the leaves swaying and i think about finding a quarry and you know hunting things then i'm going to start thinking about what it feels like to walk through the woods barefoot and hear the leaves crunching underneath my feet and hear twigs breaking as i hunt creatures and track them okay i should've learned speak with plants from keyleth i'm going to sink down and i'm going to take my armor off and try to feel the bark beneath my back this sucks is anybody around that i know good i feel really stupid right now fuck i'm going to try going underneath the tree where keyleth said where the little treehouse was yeah actually don't mind me i just have a treehouse to get to and i walk through and go under i don't know man 15 i wink at him keep walking but you like it you like it and i keep going joseph if you could wait at the door that would be really helpful thank you you're doing good work joseph at the door (laughs) all right keep walking as i go i want to put my hands on the roots and i'm going to say hey sun tree i know i can't hear you but i really need your help right now and i hope you can hear me i don't know how to do this exactly but i need to talk to pelor and there's a lot of people that are looking at me like i know what i'm doing but i have no freaking clue so if you could help guide me that would be great i sit down and i keep my hands on the roots yes god damn it ten great joseph you know what thanks for everything have a good night okay i'm great you can go you can go it's not but don't come down here thank you okay is trinket here with me pop that fucker out hi sorry about that are you okay are you comfy are you all right is this too big how much can you stay still i'm going to cast speak with animals trinket can you come over here i'm going to just lay down dear i'm just going to lean on you i just need you right now yeah it's days down here trinket we're imprisoned forever this fucking title i thought i wanted it i thought i did yeah i know well it's not going to be forever eventually we'll get sick of it dear and then we'll leave i lean back on him and just look up at the roots and say oh pelor you have something to tell me and i want to hear it and i'm getting tired of being down here but i swear i'm fine i'm going to keep concentrating because i'm committed to you and i'm committed to this hunt and i'm committed to this title and this city and your tree and your leaves and your trunk and these roots and the dirt around me and all of that and i'm going to keep thinking all right oh i thought that was a 20 but it's not 15 (laughs) it worked it worked you are awesome sun tree you're the best pelor that is some fucked up shit okay trinket wake up we have to go hunt a thing that looks really scary i'm going to die how about you good call let's go oh fuck do i just fucking go straight for it i don't know i don't know how to go find the lake that he came out of do i remember what it smelled like it's really fast it was going through the trees do i remember a specific look do i remember hearing about a lake in the woods okay and i definitely put my armor back on what am i rolling i'm rolling really great tonight which is great 11 if i turn that way it'll be coming at me this way okay okay i'm going to run to percy do i need to-- ooh am i allowed to ask him i'm going to run to percy at least i got some sleep i had a vision yeah it looks really really scary though so thank you okay i have a question i saw a lake a glade do you know of any glass-like percy do you know of anything that's big and tall around ten feet has six eyes going straight down in a row in pairs really thick hide skin legs like trunks-- well is it usually different creatures did that have anything to do with this great just wondering just thought of it okay i might see you later and i go okay okay okay roll good roll good all right stop rolling like shit all right oh god i thought that said a one investigation 24 fuck an intelligence check would be 19 okay i hop on trinket's back and we take off i'm a lady oh yeah because this is my favored terrain that was the same thing both times so 22 this is where it was i remember him jumping into the trees i cast pass without a trace on myself and i'm going to stealth after him i'm going to put him in the locket for the time being oh right 33 so again a 24 oh wait 22 oh my god oh my god oh my god a small poo it's just gone can i look up it's an open glade you said that's okay i get advantage because that's my favored terrain that's cocked i can see that's a four though that's worse but my perception is 13 so that's 15 for perception wow really you dicks why are you betraying me in this moment that i need you the most but i'd have to hop down on the ground i'm still stealthed though i'm going to climb down the tree oh that's actually really good i'm going to take a minute i don't know what kind of creature it is though i don't know if i can use my primeval awareness i'm going to try my primeval awareness maybe-- i've got aberrations it's not a celestial probably it didn't seem like an elemental so i've got fiends those are guys that come from-- yeah the hells the aberrations fey liam and i'm going to go aberrations do i have to choose one aberrations are what like a beholder i'm going to focus on that yeah so it's within a mile of me oh up to six within my favored terrain okay can i take another second and think about fiends no fey gosh darn it is there nothing in my primeval awareness okay i'm going to see if i can find any tracks oh but that's cocked it's cocked but it's a 20 but it's cocked okay that's still good 24 i roll twice do i roll twice 32 is it looking at me yeah i'm going to take out an arrow oh god and i'm going to fire a bramble shot at the eyes and i'm sharpshooter i mean i get no-- three-quarter-- oh i could if i didn't put my hunter's mark on it but i'm going to hunter's mark him before i do that oh he's huge maybe this was a mistake i should have talked to him i'm trying to bramble shot him and wait before i did that i get my broom ready and then i'm going to do what i said yeah clever girl (laughter) i got 29 dc 17 he is not restrained but he does take an additional 4d8 of damage which is right here ten 15 21 bramble shot damage yes ten 11 12 13 14 was this a surprise attack so isn't that an automatic crit as an assassin plus the what arrow damage was two lightning damage was two one for hunter's mark and then i get a sneak attack on him too and then four for that plus ten additional for the eight and the two for the bracers oh no only ten oh wait do i get to roll twice because i'm in my favored terrain it all makes sense now you can have urban settings as your favored terrain ten for initiative i know okay matthew great that's not a good thing that hits me that doesn't hit me okay i'm going to pop trinket out behind him i'm going to disengage and bamf up into the sky on my broom what is that 30 yeah but i want to get up to a tree that's far away from him i don't want to hang out on the broom i just want to be high enough that he can't jump up to me right away you know what i mean okay and then i want to brace myself in a tree so if i fell off the broom i wouldn't fall onto the ground yeah sure yes he can jump really far i know i'm going to shoot him twice but through my blazing bowstring okay 25 for the first awesome that's five plus eight is 13 plus four for hunter's mark plus three for sneak attack plus four lightning damage plus two for the bracers so 26 damage oh wait plus the blazing bowstring which is another seven that's fire damage my hunter's mark is in there and then i'm going to try to do it again i'm going to try to do the same thing again that's fucking cocked 28 18 for the arrow plus three lightning damage plus six for the hunter's mark and i don't get another sneak attack and the blazing bowstring is another seven that's not fucking bad all i'm going to do is go you know you seem like a nice guy i hate to kill you (laughter) trinket gets a swipe at him i think he likes me y'all what is it a bite attack or a claw attack does it matter a bite attack then that is 12 plus nine 21 where's my d6 nine that hits me motherfucker that's great that is a 34 and he falls to the ground and he hurts himself okay i'm going to do something this is all fucking concentration so i can't do shit i'm going to go up higher i'm going to hope that i'm going out of his range yeah okay and i'm going to shoot him (laughs) i'm going to shoot him twice 19 yes okay that's 16 plus two lightning damage plus one for hunter's mark but i do get sneak attack because trinket's next to him right well i run trinket up to him how about that i run trinket up to him so a six for the sneak attack is he prone i'm going to for my bonus action have trinket attack him with a bite attack before i send off my second arrow oh a 20 12 that's not 12 that's lower that's four that's okay it was just one anyway okay i don't do that very often trinket's attack was 24 okay so that's 12 for him and then i'm going to do my second attack and that is 20-something which hits okay okay okay i hope he can't get up this high ten 11 12 plus four lightning damage and no sneak attack i say so i mean what are you doing out here i mean do you work for pelor is this like a thing you do all the time what's your sign it hits i know i'm going to die i'm going to fall and die if i get knocked off this fucking broom i should have had a feast or something before i should have talked to you and had you inspire me yeah i should've thought about those things i was really excited about going and hunting things strength check that's not a 20 that's a ten to the tree to another tree because it hit me and it kind of changed the trajectory trinket sees it happening and he runs over and he saves me and everything's fine and i am still the grand mistress can i grab it as i'm falling it gets to attack again even though it threw something jesus trinket got a natural 20 (cheering) okay so that's a bite attack triple the dice damn it i was real excited 16 ooh yeah that's doubled he's biting it's a bite he's a bear thanks buddy i say why are we doing this why are we even fighting is this a thing is this a thing should we talk about this yeah no would i use my whole turn to try to talk to him as i disengage can i try to stand up-- oh fuckballs that's a bad idea i roll out of the way of him right 'cause he's looming over me is he within-- can i disengage out of this great cool how the fuck what the fuck am i going to do i'm going to-- i mean-- i already used a bonus action to disengage so i can't take a healing potion the broom is attached it's dragging behind me yeah but then he'll just attack me again i'm going to shoot him i'm going to commit i'm going to shoot him twice as i'm staring at him say this is-- this is not the kind of hunt that i am used to and i try to shoot him i mean i guess i don't have any kind of concentration up anymore because i got fucking destroyed these are all bonus though really i can't do shit i kind of suck fenthras can do bramble shot which i already did 17 misses or hits okay 11 12 12 plus one lightning damage trinket ran up as i was saying that plus two sneak attack trinket's going to run up and take his swipe while i'm doing this oh wait no i used my bonus action to disengage trinket can't do that great okay 29 this is bad this is bad this is bad guys this is super bad 14 15 16 oh that doesn't count 16 plus two lightning damage i'm just going to put my arms down and stare at him 16 fuck doesn't hit that definitely hits dodge dodge dodge ugh i don't have uncanny dodge yet that's level five or seven or something i'm alive i'm alive i'm alive oh it's trying to grapple me 18 it's okay neither can i i'm going to have trinket run up and i'm going to fuckin' a have to disengage and run the fuck away 'cause that's all i can do i'm going to disengage and run as far towards that tree circle as i can okay yeah so i want trinket in front of me and then i'm going to take two more shots at him i know i'm going to die if i don't do this okay that hits that hits that's 28 okay okay 12 13 14 14 15 16 two for lightning damage and then six for the sneak attack i don't want it to be fatal just the feather end (laughter) i want to get him in the shoulder up here trinket is standing right in front of him eyeing him down and i say you're a noble creature sent here for a reason yes you can leave you can go back to where you came from i protect this forest now this is mine i'm scared of all of my dice right now oh god i know right straight charisma seven i know right it's not a saving throw it's just a check i'm going to throw up it can leap no it leaves i take the final arrow before it gets away 18 i'm going to throw up sorry this is so late guys 15 16 17 plus two lightning damage just right between the shoulder blades i walk up and i scratch trinket on the head you did real good there bud we're not dead and i cast cure wounds on myself and then i walk over and try to find a fucking trophy on this guy i'm just going to cut his hand off i'm going to cut his hand off no biggie jeez this was maybe the wrong sort of trophy to grab okay wow you're really strong did you know that and i guess i'm going to-- you don't have to carry it just yet 'cause i want to set fire to the body and burn it i'm going to use some of the branches from the trees he fucking knocked over to set a fire around well i'm going to do it in that opening right there look at that i guess i can't because-- i feel like as a hunter i would know how to set a fire to something without setting fucking fire to the trees i'm good at campfires yo this is survival 18 i bet everyone thinks we're dead hey pelor pelor i don't know if i'm saying your name wrong thanks for that and i'll be here next time you send something my way who has a mimosa it's so heavy i couldn't pick it up trinket had to carry it it was this big weird rhino-y thing with six eyes i tried to talk to him but he just didn't want to listen and i swear he almost fucking killed me i didn't want him to know-- i mean yeah i set fire to him for you bud wait i asked you i asked you before i left do you know of anything that's gray with six eyes and you didn't know and now you know he was really really tough to kill you guys if we had been there together no problem insta-death wait does that mean it was a good guy did i kill a good thing does that

amazing and maybe wear a top hat as i was doing it you know just to be really badass yeah you know something very hunt-y a sort of thing-- and then it just fell a-fucking-part i mean no i killed it don't worry but then as i was doing it i was like maybe i shouldn't be killing it i don't know what i'm supposed to do and then i tried to talk to it and it just didn't sound like it was listening to
