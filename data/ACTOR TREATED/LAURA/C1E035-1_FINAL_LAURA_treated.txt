buddy what do i roll for that whoa i feel so strong now 11 so i'm at 34 points what scanlan i'm just letting you know you're not skilled with ranged attacks i know we need to take care of that orb so wait it's still there can i look over at lady briarwood and do a check on her to see if she looks stable that's good because i noticed your beard that's right i am trinket careful that's magic but i'm still pretty low if you feel like it i would take it and i would be grateful pike heal us all we love you oh wait but wait don't let lady briarwood in the circle of healing we're away from the fucking sacrifice area maybe we should just kill her i don't know wow punch her in the face she'll be knocked unconscious and she'll have to save three times again she almost killed me the spinning orb of death she might be unconscious too don't lie to us anymore what natural 20 damn it i had a really strong reaction to that yeah but he's on this side of the table look at his eyes he is the whispered one this is normally the time when sam would-- cassandra does any of that sound familiar when you betrayed us you said you were serving a higher purpose did they plan to sacrifice you to him percival don't oh god i pull an arrow and aim it right at her head percival frederickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii you will fight this monster inside of you oh shit what did he give you oh i will gladly do that for you i check her person for anything valuable you guys he's got smoke billowing out of him right now pike do you know anything about vecna and he created a vampire he made sylas a vampire do you need someone else to do it for you your thing (laughs) let me know if i'm lying because-- 23 ooh two in one it looks like there was more tongue with you though sam i knew you were going to do that i almost did it when he was whispering in your ear just for your sake behind him i shoot a holy arrow at it oh man we're out of like everything aren't we oh jeez okay well i've still got two 3rd-level spells we have pike oh my god this has been in him for three years four years no don't say that it's too late i shot an arrow at it yeah of course he is oh wait but we were holding hands at one point so we would be close that seems good we're good how did my holy arrow do 25 is it a surprise attack yes 28 and 27 awesome okay these two balls so 15 16 17 plus holy damage 17 plus four is 21 and then ten for the second and then i hunter's mark him i didn't say i hunter's marked him at the beginning-- i'm explaining this to you guys because i'd already said i shot at him so i was being honest i'm looking at the chat room because i know they're going to tell me i forgot my damn hunter's mark ooh i didn't do holy damage for the second one yeah plus two more for the holy damage trinket moves around and in front of me to protect me yeah either or magic one of the two didn't affect it we have advantage 22 18 for pike scanlan badass pike your d20 what he's a demon i have favored enemy as demons oh so demons are my favored enemy so i have advantage against recalling information about them can i recall anything about something that looks like this i'm not that smart 12 got it good to know okay all right then i'm going to cast-- where is he (shouting) he's in the fucking wall hunter's mark can i sense anything about where he is so he's hiding all right then for my bonus action i'm going to hide as well really well hold on let me add my stealth to it that's a 12 i do pretty much nothing and i'm going to hold my turn until he appears oh right i'm glowing no wonder i rolled so poorly it's beautiful right behind him whoa we get advantage on attacking him (groan) that was 38 just kidding liam and (singing) my math is awesome yes yes here's my question because i want to be honest and i don't remember if i said i dipped arrows in the second holy oil flask or if i put them on trinket's claws do we remember that's fine then i'm going to shoot two more holy arrows at him okay well i'll roll for that with advantage which is good i'm going to switch things new ones (gasps) what just happened seriously so one was a 25 and then 17 i mean 19 19 and a 25 was the first roll and the second-- oh see i was rolling-- i understand i was rolling it in my head differently but we'll count it as that i was counting it as that was my first attempts at my first two attacks and my second attempts at my first two attacks yeah okay that's fine so 25 i won't roll like that anymore where am i that's radiant damage and that's that here we go all right 17 plus five is-- 24 points 22 i'm still against the wall glowing we should probably light up this area as much as possible fyi oh no yay pike is it times two after that because it's a crit what was it pike 21 times two please oh no oh yeah i did 20 i know i really did miss the whispers i hadn't even realized how much i missed them until today he's licking his ear a lot are you low pike didn't you get healed from your own healing yeah she's running away me okay who all's around him pike and grog all right then i'm going to shoot a couple of arrows at him again man i can't do anything but he's still advantage right 21 and 28 okay no i'm out of holy arrows because one of them was my exploding arrow so that's 21 for the first shitballs well there you go goodbye 21 for the second i hide again for my bonus 21 stealth no the one that i gave him no she didn't come on come on oh my god because we're morons (gasps) cassandra i cannot believe we left her alive what you're not going to kill the smoke beast it was an 18 he rolled 18 see no problem this is why i look over your shoulder even when my math is bad but she was almost unconscious and then it's gone wait 19 for me 13 for trinket do you want a bite attack or a claw attack oh right i have to-- no yeah okay that's 11 i rolled 11 what no oh okay 15 no i rolled four times two is eight is 15 24 13 for trinket yeah and then right when he gets to his height trinket reaches up and bites him as hard as he can and lashes him around like dog with a toy he disappears it disappeared maybe it disappeared forever (whispering) percival wait i meant to loot her earlier and it didn't happen sorry i just really like that part don't you fucking do this to me (gasps) for archery purposes i'm like five feet away from you at this point i get up in time to smack him upside the head she's naked good job brother
