stealthily-- -- check out what the camp is 20 (gasps) oh this was her camp kima was here oh mine mine mine okay that's nice torch torch torch torch can i use tracking and see what happened like prince humperdink please can do okay okay well can i see who was attacked first does it look like kima was attacked or she-- the drag marks do they lead outside of the alcove and down okay do we need to rest i mean-- -- i feel like we need to get our spells back otherwise we're just gonna get killed yeah i guess that's the best thing to do maybe seal the tunnel behind us yeah so that-- -- if they do come they have to like try to get through trying to get through yeah all right yeah i know you can keep burning a torch stick it in the ground oh sweet yeah let's fully rest tinker's you do this is the best day ever gently i gingerly put it in my quiver oh god all right should i keep it away from the rest of my stuff is there a possibility it could explode just-- maybe i won't keep it straight
