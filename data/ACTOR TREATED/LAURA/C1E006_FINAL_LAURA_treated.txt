go us yeah trinket we should probably rest we're by that lake with the giant monster and went down to that place that you told us not to go in the first place yeah that's where we ended up right so we don't really - oh we can take hit points on a personal level or no no no we're going into the cavern no we're going into the tunnel no no no in through the tunnel that tunnel no no no no no and popped this out right there so now we're going into this that's behind us we're going down down down shall we does he need healing scanlan stop being creepy does it hurt us to get near it oh oh yes but what about water oh my oh nice oh okay lovely so should we try to cross this little path here can i use my tracking to see any of those duergar to see if any of them have passed through the area if there's a large group of them ahead of us i can use my tracking and my favored terrain to see how many within 6 miles if there's a large group of them ooh here we go oh okay okay that's better is that it 21 so as quickly as possible we should get through these tunnels i assume yes so 3 to 4 miles up you said from where we are at this point we should probably start stealthing at this point yes should we all try to stealth 20 this is where kima’s being held she had a vision oh that’s where the trapdoor is yeah you missed a lot scanlan sweet oh yes and we know here because the general that we mind melded - clarota read his brain i know it’s just you were drunk so i’m reiterating it (all laugh) so remember scanlan that the general said that on the left side of the fortress-- --is how we can get into the trapdoor by the smaller of two lava flows lava flows yes by king murghol so there is a lot of cover as we go near it because of all the… it’s pretty dark here right but nothing at a distance so we should keep to the left and head down that direction and try to-- right and lady kima's being held here yes yes it's on the left yes so we're heading left and going-- you guys take care of trinket as i'm ahead of you oh i'll go back then should i or is it okay because we're all together 20 i can ambush them yeah yeah yeah well okay but i can - (whispering) i can be really quiet i can do hide in plain sight now so i could completely hide myself standing there oh can i look okay let's look (whispering) everybody stay quiet they won't find us potentially but i want to hear what they're saying what does that mean i'm vex he's vax we look alike it's understandable oh no then don't keep pass without a trace that's okay that’s okay just a little bit ahead and see what we can see 17 wait no i get advantage on perception because i'm in my favored terrain oh yeah never mind okay (all laugh) yes hold on (gasps) oh shit fried banana thank you chatroom okay so we walk back so apparently number one big party we don't want to fight them if we don't have to secondly there's some weirdo creature that's gotten loose and is very very bad and it's killed multiple duergar already that might be the thing-- no but it might be the thing we already killed it could've been the thing with the plate that showed up in the camp i don't know the big thing it could've been that i'm not sure regardless we should be very careful traveling forward i like the way you think all right should we keep moving forward at a very stealthy sort of pace possibly could be farther can we see the molten things that he was talking about the lava flows still too far away oh wow (laughs) don't say that (whispering) be quiet ooh we should go towards that one no scanlan what did you do can you persuade the dm come on come on d20 (soft high voice) no no yes 14 (all laugh) i'll stop (gasps) oh god (gasps) stop can we stop can we stop scanlan shh (whispering) you're singing is the arm attached to whatever did-- --is the arm part of a dead thing or is it alive can i check it out as well i mean i'm there i might as well wait i'm doing advantage too just in case okay that one's better no i got it because i'm fucking in my favored terrain (all laugh) (gasps) this is the skelly pile yes definitely a very large beaver based on tracking and everything and insight can we tell if that creature is anywhere nearby or if it's gone (gasps) it's that big creature that - it was like one of those things that that thing put together like-- and it seems like it was here recently or a while ago should we get out of here we could try to set a trap or we could look and see if we can loot anything is there anything to loot does it look like anything shiny okay i like gold ooh well we killed a lot of duergar this time there's a big centipede-y human creepy creature that's killed a lot of things and we should probably avoid that at all costs can we avoid that and still head left of the keep that's where we're going liam & should we probably have looked for like a nest yeah so we should just keep freaking being careful and keep going towards the giant thing and that makes you want to make out with him let's keep going oh really and this is plus 10 already oh percy (gasps) you have a plus 10 30 oh no just a person can they see us does it look like they can see us (whispering) so there's a person standing right there (whispering) a person he's just standing there no hmm maybe it's a scarecrow yeah that's what i mean can't you go invisible go invisible and check it out oh no if he's magic he's going to know (whispering) it's a statue oh no we do have basilisk eggs in the bag of holding oh what's that oh it's scanlan what was it can we look at clarota and say “do you know anything about this” have basilisks do we remember how to take care of basilisks like do we not look at them is that how they don't-- don't look them in the eye or don't look at their face yes okay oh well never mind he's got it all right yeah let's keep going did you know him so you know how to do that didn't we do that didn't we have to do that i turned to stone i remember i remember yeah i remember

don't to need check it again he didn't tell us to oh right right right can i come up and look and see if i can see any tracking if there's any footprints around a certain area around this yeah it's okay no no no i get an advantage shush is it investigation 22 (gasps sighs) okay does it look like it's safe to bring everybody up here or does it seem like anything's around that could see us anything looking from above okay we're going to have to be super-- yeah you can do you have something that can pull it towards you ooh oh yeah maybe you can move it away and then cool it yeah i guess we came back to the group and told them about what's going on oh really wait but he's got sneak attack yeah but we could-- if keyleth can bird up or you could go over on the flying carpet or something

vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence vex'ahlia and her twin brother vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other it was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in singorn the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief while vex kept to the woods she preferred the isolation always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot and through a series of fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear - her own stolen trinket - to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely also he is adorable and gives expert massages (drumming battle music) (drumming battle music continues) autographed photo we're going to look into that i think we should go through the door instead of going up because any prisoners are probably going to be kept at a low level can we very stealthily try to open - oh check for traps
