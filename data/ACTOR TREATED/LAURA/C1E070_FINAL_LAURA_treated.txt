oh no no you are not doing that right now wow that made me sweat merch stuff coming up yeah preorders for the hoodies are still going on aren't they how about that guys they're still happening you can still order those for i think a whole other week no am i wrong i'm stroking out so hard for another week we don't know what we're doing yet in addition though to batman the telltale series gears of war is launching on the 11th we just did a big live event yesterday gears of war 4 if you got the ultimate edition you can download it and you can play it early as in tonight which you shouldn't do you should be watching us but you could do it after you're done watching us your trailer looks so good that's as far it gets right now are those real games register to vote you've still got some time that's it we're just supposed to trust you keyleth what's their plan what's your illness so you come before us and you tell us you're weak well obviously but i don't believe anything she says is he still insane we've seen this before can you talk him into flying off leaving everyone alone so dead then ditto oh that was terrible ugh 13 well yeah sure she does she have you been here as asum this whole time what have you been doing what do you do sleep in his room like a halfling if you tell us what the disease is-- have you tried greater restoration (laughter) how long do we have you've been checking in from where here does he know where you are so when vorugal flew over did he not sense you was he seeking you or was he seeking whitestone we won't have much time to talk after the destruction of the white dragon more deaths do not make it right keyleth a chance to take down thordak you said yourself you can't do it on your own you've been down there then why didn't we meet down there why are you so scared of it have you done anything with the rest of our friends yeah we already covered that the old war room because we moved the new one down into the ziggurat and she didn't respect that are you going to attack her all of a sudden are you going to attack her right now why that's very important i know okay because we're really smart and we totally-- that's right how long until that happens no is melora an enemy of vecna do we know that makes sense so what good are you what can you do i have an idea with that if we're in this together can i say it in front of her preferably one that doesn't rely on hate as a message what we haven't kept an eye on her the whole time you're giving her ideas right now aren't you natural 20 yes don't actually look at vorugal look at something near vorugal i don't think so either she'll know i sit on the table what's going on you did well dear i feel like she needs to talk to the spirit because she's going to try to absorb his power or something we never mentioned j'mon sa ord when we got back so asum does not know about that or raishan doesn't know about that do we have no way of having knowledge of when someone scries on us they can do it so you would know she would know if someone was trying to scry on us two speaking of vestige this is part of the plan so (gasps) the spire of conflux that's why we've heard of her shit it's resting in the belly of a terrible beast in the abyss right so gate scroll what if we bring it through let it fight vorugal kill vorugal get the staff-- not like anything could go wrong with it but-- yenk can pike-- pike have you ever heard of a goristro named yenk nothing it's a fiend in the abyss anything about a goristro at least you know how to pronounce it where is allura we haven't seen her in forever she's out-- just now yeah can we go in the library and look in the books there is there somebody religious outside of pike in the city oh yeah ask kash oh yeah you do have a shrine after all investigation oh no this has nothing to do with dragons ten did you get a 20 does it still count as a 20 did you find it that's enormous i hope the dragon kills it well that's helpful we kill them no problem anyway and i leave we should probably show everybody what we found no you first-- yeah you can do it is it thursday yet did you almost say is it thursday yet [break] okay oh it only lasts for how long the venomous tea all right yeah it'll last for 24 hours we'll keep it (gasps) that's true let's make some and put it a flask and then we'll do it later just to have some poison in general not necessarily for raishan poison i don't think this is for raishan i knew you didn't think it was for raishan six ammo (laughs) don't even encourage that-- just don't wow yeah i want to go find vax and keyleth as well oh me you want to find me hi what's up oh you saw them okay yes thank you so much grog i'll remember that all right thank you so much it's important hey did you find anything yes okay which one okay everything we need we saw on the way to the sphinx well it's here-- no but there was a ziggurat as well we went down a cavern and there was a name right and she worshipped the goddess of knowledge so maybe we need to talk to ioun no maybe we just talk to a god that's impossible unless you're-- worthless really yeah that's a nice cloak you have there keyleth this is true it looks lovely though stacked next to the rest of my clothing do you want it back he only gives cloaks to those he really cares about keyleth really cares about well it's one of yenk's brethren well obviously keyleth's there so i figured i was too do we even know how to use the gate scroll exactly scanlan has to use it right oh that's the goristro well one is called a snake lady a marilith i think it's just the one guy hopefully other things can't come through can they read that scroll again scanlan it doesn't bring other things through doesn't leave the gate open so other things could come through we will have raishan with us no we wouldn't raishan will be in disguise oh they could be at the castle what time is it whatever relevance that has right important day is that we get her over there and then we kill her afterward she was going to be another magic user dressed as a human or something yeah but a little cave a cave that asum would fit in she can sense lies can i go find zahra that's my necklace when we're not in the city he's out of the necklace yes he's always around i'm also gone knock-knock zahra how are you how are things i never noticed the drool don't worry anything interesting speaking of you've been very busy i know with all of your research but do you remember what we spoke of before we left arrows of dragon-slaying okay that's wonderful one is better than none wonderful this is costly what do i owe you i hope this isn't a lot but she made it so that's not how much it would be right zahra said it wasn't that much before oh okay but that's 30000 gold pieces jesus man i'll wait you keep making this awesome (dryly) no i know you're so busy mark it back down to one in my-- zahra you're amazing we're going into battle pretty soon these fuckers are pretty dangerous so i'm concerned keep doing what you're doing if you find the time-- thank you zahra i deserved that mary said it was only five okay i just wandered back i'm done talking to zahra hey the door's open we stay clear once we pull it through how do we keep it in place long enough for-- how do we get in front of-- how is she her and gilmore both well something you might enjoy actually feel like killing a dragon no no shit i totally did that didn't i but she wanted to come and fight the dragon i'm an idiot and they get destroyed i feel like i got us into this and i'm really sorry about that what are we voting on you're abstaining oh shit if she finds out she is going to be really super pissed i feel like she should come let's do it tree stride yeah that's true it's only ten minutes now it's only ten fucking minutes he's gone no i think you're doing it wrong scanlan-- no we don't pure stupidity she'll fuck up whitestone it'll give us away we have to get away from the city i'm keeping an eye on the time it's in draconia it's hiding what if you go running off what if you go try to kill it in here and whitestone gets destroyed it's a temptation believe me we know well we trusted her here's the thing though you have to pretend like you don't know it's super important well pretend okay perfect and don't attack no he can choose any ten minutes he wants really we go if we're totally weak though we can't fight the second dragon right away we have to save up our strength and then fight her after so we don't die don't talk to anyone kima yeah that's why percy left i'm going to-- well if we have time i'm going to attune my cold-snap armor to me so i'll probably not have my bracers attuned but i get what cold resistance and added ac or something oh no well it's asum right now yeah you're holding the roots today i talked to the sun tree he's saying that as you're holding on to his roots sorry has anybody seen keyleth oh did you have fun and sap yeah well he deserved it how about we get through the tree before we talk anymore yeah we're popping in far enough away right in the tree grove up above the chasm can you set us up what's my armor class now that i've put the cold-snap armor on i did so is it up two points from that kima there's extra rooms upstairs but it uses one of your spells is that all right i mean it's pretty important who what she was vorugal's a male scry on tooma i'll sit in the door and i'll keep an eye on this natural 20 33 i think that's dangerous both anything near vorugal i feel like it's dangerous plus thordak has those scrying balls within the location i think scanlan polymorphed something very teeny and let her know the plan of releasing-- no we can't wander on down into vorugal's territory that's why i said if you polymorph into a teeny flying bug-- dragons see a lot a lot pretty close to the dragon be safe this is dangerous how are you going to stay in earshot just from the top of the cavern i can cast past without a trace on you that's true if we bust out the thing and then-- i don't know if pass without a trace works if i'm not near you yeah but there was no dragon last time i want to sit on the door i should've gone i really should've gone that's important the diseased-- oh god i didn't think about that can you inspire yourself when you're casting a spell
