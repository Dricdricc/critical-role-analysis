amazing wait look at your gauntlets they're glowing what does it mean what's it do what's it do oh shit imagine if we had done that before we went after the dragons damn sick maybe we can find an old

well i mean we're outside all right i know he would've loved that i feel like we should go celebrate and drink but it wouldn't feel right without him right i think that would be good maybe get some potions before we head out here because everyone's low i'll just stop by the store and pick some health potions from where we got them before i mean we've got fucking shit to sell-- -- and stuff to buy but that's kind of a thing that creepy-ass book we need to look at no yeah it's fine it's fine i'm just fucking sitting here no big deal shit a quick buying of potions i just wanna see if i can get some stuff i should've just shaken that instead of just-- yeah 14 are you the cart guy fucking who-- i didn't abuse him everyone else abused him i was very kind to you see we're friends we're all friends here yeah said he didn't like me very much travis and just some potions all right i'll just stand next to him while you do business with him could you understand that yeah yeah it's just muffled it's just muffled for him stuff to sell it is so unfortunate we are saviors of emon saviors of the world really and he doesn't even care oh is it you know i don't like him i don't even want to buy it from him no grog please don't don't shop without me no no i'm standing here i can't let you do this i don't know me personally if that is a good amount but vex would know is that a good amount

count it out for you grog it's below him it's beneath him to count this gold he's also a lord there you are c'mon grand poobah oh my god no just a couple of times just a couple of times it's the guy that took advantage of grog grog was he grog he took advantage of you before-- -- and i didn't like that oh really well all right then thanks darling which one do you want i cast cure wounds on him

that thing though i really do but no i'm okay we're fine everything's fine except scanlan's still unconscious so maybe we should go see if he's all right all right good good you guys didn't seem awkward at all while i walked up maybe we should go tree a tree can you still do a tree stride let's do a tree no i don't think we have to druid magic's different it's not like-- it's not like showy wizard magic yeah it's like jazz hands and druid magic is like modern dance like a little fart i just start heading-- -- towards the castle i start heading towards the castle percy knows knows where did we leave him again his arms are still up okay jeez it's up to you grog how you doing kaylie how long has he been like this who did this to him gross that's fucking foul keyleth scanlan (gasps) you don't remember no you killed it and then we all celebrated and you had a big orgy yeah but you are not and that's very important kaylie thank you i sit down on the bed with you well it just seemed like the logical thing to do dear right well 'cause you said that-- what would you rather she just discover it on her own this way she-- scanlan she came here she helped bring you back you know what that means right you think it's bad that she cares about you scanlan scanlan she thought nothing of you when you met her all right the fact that she showed up here and saw that you gave your life for a greater cause that's so much more important than any promise you made i think it is she didn't run away and after the fact she stayed here and looked after you wait you heard that's a lie what do you want us to do we did get the dog we did get your dog we did i searched-- i thought i did the magic search fucking hell you don't have to scanlan nobody knew that any of this was going on how many times have we asked you if you're all right and you just laugh and joke we can't help you if you don't tell us what's going on well apparently you do darling get used to it nobody likes needing someone you are well maybe you should fucking talk to her you should don't treat her like a fucking sacred object treat her like a daughter scanlan is your father still alive that's why he's an asshole now (tiredly) no you're not really just like that i grab the gatestone off the end table where we left it with him and hand it over to you as well i'd rather it go to you i just pick up a pillow and throw it at the door well that didn't go like i thought it would kinda wish we would've gone drinking in vasselheim now (tearily) and he hates us now (angrily) fuck him fuck him for not saying anything sooner and fuck us for not asking (sniffs) i start cleaning it up well he seemed pretty pissed that i went and got kaylie even though he ran away with her at the first chance he had pike are you okay he says he does i have no fucking clue i'm not gonna go anywhere keyleth obviously my take-away from scanlan is that we all talk too much and i leave the room and that's where scanlan's waiting blacklight (laughs) crying in a corner he's not no he's not guys no stop it i come back and i take that off i'm like no keyleth you took that from me when you were drunk last night

wrong can you scry yeah see where he is what he's doing and just like project it on the wall behind her so we can watch it like that movie to see if he senses it maybe wait what did you roll no he walked out in a fucking nightgown that's good just in case we should've invited kaylie to come with us they could've stayed-- yeah right as we head to the tree i pull grog aside and i ask him are you all right grog i mean i know i know you got your lady favors out of the way and all that but scanlan was your bestie right outside of pike well yeah me and pike cause you saw my titties yeah right i'm
