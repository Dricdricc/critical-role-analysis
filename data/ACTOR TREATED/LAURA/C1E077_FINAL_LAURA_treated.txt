i'm shouting it to just one of you guys-- (yelling) get the boys safe seriously should i hang out and wait or should we-- do i see any dragons i don't see any dragons but it looks like about a hundred enemies well that's going to take a minute so i hunter's marked them as soon as they were close enough the one that's biggest the one that's closest and i am a third level rogue now so i get advantage on my attack if they haven't attacked me yet right if they haven't taken a turn as an assassin at your third level you get advantage if you get the drop if they haven't taken a turn yet they're moving well all right i guess i'll just have a 32 attack then 21 and then-- that is awesome do i get sneak attack on this okay so it's just 21 damage with four of lightning oh i didn't do hunter's mark damage an additional three do i get my second attack 21 18 damage trinket crits on a 19 does it petrify you i'm vex hunter's mark 25 23 on the first arrow that is what 23 yeah 23 travis and shut up ugh 13 three ones in a row there's a hundred more guys inside grog keep running i'm on the broom so i'm up and over the wall are there any clusters that look like not a lot of our soldiers around just lizardmen or is it all mixed in together are there any wyverns in the sky that don't see us i want to try to get a sneak attack on one of the wyverns i get advantage because the wyverns don't see me right okay 19 okay 33 31 31 on the first hit 31 and the same it's another 35 attack 25 on the second poor your ass i don't know can i shoot him with a bramble shot i want to try to shoot him with a

restrained yeah he takes 16 damage 16 damage from the shot as far as i know i get another of my arrow damage what i didn't know that that's so cool is it sneak attack the thing on top hopefully he doesn't have a hold of the reins so-- now i've lost track 28 damage plus the 16 from the bramble shot okay 21 oh that guy that was annoyed with us every time we-- i don't know yeah he's probably
