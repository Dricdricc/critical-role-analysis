there's anything-- yeah oh he already rolled look at him perception 25 hm all right do i notice any-- does it seem-- well without touching it any kind of poisonous in nature anything like that i don't get one anymore you're taking it off of me right now all right ugh should we try breathing it and see what happens i just reach my arm into the mist and just see-- oh maybe we should just not touch the mist and go straight through the room so you can blow it and we just walk through should we go let's go before it gets back go go go i perception-checked the room it didn't seem like there was anything vax super duper short well all vax has to do is roll because he's already on the freaking ground we're still in the room oh they're coming with us they're like coming with us through the whole thing keyleth blow the smoke again blow the mist away if you can and now we run (shouts) your breath smells pretty good though keyleth do you want to shoot an arrow in yeah let's do it 16 he's better great those are probably traps pressure plates maybe what shouldn't we throw something onto one of the pressure plates first and see what it does are you kidding me vax jeez well let's try this first because you might just break it down completely you are much more powerful than i am percy all right can i try to shoot an arrow into the little hole oh jeez louise okay what does that mean this is what an attack thanks grog you know what i'm going to tie this to the arrow it's going to give it really good luck i'm not actually going to tie it to the arrow i'm just going to tuck it-- yeah so you can deflect it if i-- all right thanks tiberius oh i'm so nervous i'm going to roll the fancy one we got last week all right (laughs) oh no okay i add my attack bonus plus an inspiration dice oh that's awesome okay 35 (yelling) oh let me just see if i got it first hey you totally could have done that nice yeah all right good job getting slammed into the roof like that yeah okay woo yes oh let-- no we haven't even talked about it at all donate donate i don't even know what that means so donations tonight are going to gamechanger yeah awesome i think donations tonight will definitely go to gamechanger yeah yeah the portion of the donations that would normally go to 826la tonight are going to go to gamechanger oh awesome anything over a dollar it would be good if you donated more than one dollar if you want oh god okay ugh nice what's plastic i stealth immediately oh yeah that would be good so with the pass without a trace 31 pass without a trace can i cast while they're coming-- where did i write it down never mind i can't find my spell i cast entangle on the ground yeah (quickly) yeah yeah yeah i'm reading it now oh that's not what it was that's the wrong spell sorry sorry it's spike growth is the spell i cast spike growth yes which is-- the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns it's difficult terrain for the duration but anybody that can see me casting it doesn't take damage to it it's only the people that don't see me casting it yeah any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a wisdom check oh well that's not quite the same thing then what i saw (yells) forget it my spell is stupid i know they can see the ground then no don't cast it not you guys but they-- that's my punishment i don't think that should count wheatoning yeah 23 he's gone me oh i'm going to cast conjure barrage at all of the spiders coming at us i'm going to hunter's mark whatever one looks the biggest oh where am i oh i'm going to move to where i'm in the middle of them i'm still kind of stuck yeah and then i'll conjure barrage from there i cast hunter's mark on the biggest one i see okay it does 3d8 on all creatures they get-- yes they do they get half-damage if they save (in a funny gruff voice) my dc is 14 okay do i need to roll for attack oh sweet okay cool okay 3d8 15 and then 20 for the big one with the hunter's mark can i have trinket attack oh that's a lot of them okay so i get a second attack cool i'm going to step back against the wall nah he can't really get anywhere it's fine it's good times guys (gasps) what i think you should stick with it it's awesome fireball nice now you're in front of the spiders you're killing them good because i rolled an eight ugh oh there's what there's three spiders left oh he is so dead oh bamf-ing spiders me it hits me 17 oh wait 19 (grunts in pain) oh it's straight-up damage i should cast that on us yeah eat it ooh i bet we can get some of that poison dip the arrows in it ooh oh we can just use them okay oh thank you keyleth tiberius would you happen to have a little glass vial or something i could put this in oh thank you oh oh wait i thought you weren't poisoned-- oh you need healing because you are-- okay yeah but we took a short break and we're not doing that now no can i ask a question while she's healing percy the grappling arrow i used on the little halfling i can get that back right just making sure no sam already said it scanlan no (groans) oh wow are there sapphires all over the walls in here then (gasps) oh no that was my big fancy one really really high eight can i try to stealth and move alongside just kind of keep to the edge okay i rolled 18 on the stealth and trinket's going to stay next to keyleth can we see a spider in here like a big spider okay can i-- it's dark i'm going to use my primeval awareness and see if i can sense any spiders in the area good to know (whispers) lots of spiders lots i'm going to cast protection from poison on myself before she touches anything can i let her know that there's a whole lot of spiders on the other side of the room just so everybody's aware those things we just fought there's a ton more of them on the other side of this little chamber no problem good thing you took that beard off because it had bells and shit in it (whispers) lots and lots of spiders is that going to make noise perhaps we should deal with the spiders before we make noise or maybe just be prepared in fact you know what i'm going to cast spike growth on the ground in between where they're going to have to walk through because they can't freaking see it right now can they yeah there yeah it affects-- damn it-- i didn't put it in my thingy because i'm dumb i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry spike growth it is a 20-foot radius that's not that much and it's hard spikes hard spikes and thorns oh nice question that chamber in the center of the room does it go all the way to the ceiling or is it-- so there's a huge-- so technically the spiders could crawl up the ceiling and drop down on us yeah ooh that's awesome what had to be a spiderweb everybody (whispers) why 14 that's 2d4 for every five feet crossed 2d4 for every five feet 22 (whispers) we should get out golems are meant to protect can i see oh god 25 should i be rolling for trinket okay thank you okay (gasps) oh no what what 13 oh no oh no grog your beard has been singed yeah you can grow it back grog you've got some good security down there a little warning next time would be great yeah oh i'll hold onto that yeah a little broken we thought were maybe just disarming it but i think we probably broke it oh grog actually-- i've got some remnants of a lovely beard and i try to smush it onto his chin it looks pretty good dang it highbearer vord is the temple to sarenrae on the way to the-- oh all of us can-- magic thought it was banned (whispers)
