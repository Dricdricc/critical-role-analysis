what was the code again they have all kinds of wood it's really freaking cool yeah you are actually do we all get to see what we're dressed as get out of here dread this is rat queens i'm hannah you should check it out it's an awesome comic book huh oh i'm conjuring up a little fuck you it's pretty great oh my god i'm so sweaty but we skipped over my brother we're all going to die when we're goofy looking [dramatic music] it's actually really difficult to play a character when you're dressed as a different character not going to lie we're going to learn how to do it so we are-- wait i forget we're in the tavern it's nighttime now are we really going to talk about names right now and not about the giant creepy smoke monster that came out of you percy i don't think it's safe to leave tonight it might be smart to be down in the cellar tonight not up okay burt your mustache is falling off yeah do that and he doesn't even smile at all you didn't seem to mind it as it was happening (flatly) oh that's all who is the last bullet for we don't want to lose you percy no we won't do that damn it where is pike she would know about this can we do any kind of religion check to see if we know anything about this kind of entity 17 i think that's the best plan we have actually you did look pretty amazing i'm not going to lie but i don't like how dark it went percy it went really dark that guy deserved it but we did rip his tongue out which i think was a bit harsh this is beheading a pony all over again we're not going to kill civilians they'll probably be pretty happy that the people that have been hurting them are being punished done no he's saying that if he goes dark if he goes against his person that we know-- we're not going to do that we're going to knock him the fuck out don't worry percy we've got you i walk up and i kiss him on the cheek and i say don't you worry we've got you i don't believe you're really sick darling lovely thank you scanlan we have a map of the city yes i think it best to stay off the streets is it possible keyleth to tunnel through the city underneath it no but they know we're here it's not safe we can come up in secret leave symbols to rally the people and hide again are we going there now are we resting can i sense anything near us can i sense vampires above us undead does it feel like there's more in motion than there were before we set off the blaze okay that's why we stay under the city that's what i said all right nothing like a bubble of protection or anything but they're undead lovely well first watch who's taking it i still think we should keep watch i hate that he's asking for clarification don't 'what' me well you can light your little flaming warhammer i'm pretty sure he just said bagel what what do you want can we see if it's magic oh good i rolled a one shit it's a teeny tiny tunnel the source of the bad it's possible it is what if the briarwoods are right under the sun tree and we're right above them you look really good matt oh 22 22 are they vampires they can they're fucking vampires don't forget that we all have our amazing metal around our neck that scanlan got us hey oh no we haven't had another feast yet i'm going to say wake the fuck up and i am going to-- can i hide is that what i do as my bonus even if it's super-duper dark that makes perfect sense i'm going to hunter's mark the one that looks the strongest i am now going to attack him with my blazing bow all right natural 20 that's right i add all of my dice together and then i double it and then i add the modifier okay and i hunter's marked him yeah 31 that's 31 damage the second one was a three it was a 14 to hit wow really can i aid him by shooting him at the same time as he is trying to break the grapple it's been a lot of ones today man is your little butt flap down are you in the long johns i'll do my second arrow and try to hit him again because i don't like that i missed i know right don't suck so hard me that's better that definitely hits it was an 18 plus-- i said it was the one against percy even though the other one is hunter's marked well i'm just saying yes 16 burt reynolds should play with us more often are you really yeah he did we should probably use sunlight on them always because don't they turn into mist if we don't kill them i don't know should we attack him or should we let-- oh yeah i bust out one of the wooden daggers i walk up and i try to stab it into his heart in front of my brother okay i still get two attacks right 19 okay then what do i do probably no 14 nine wooden stakes don't work i back up a little bit i guess so can i move away since he's grappled i'm going to stay right there thanks trinket sunlight and water should we ask it questions or something okay good job scanlan future reference the fog is bad not totally natural seriously though put your dick away we probably gave away our location we should probably get the fuck out really yay hey that's what i rolled when i was trying to check things out yes we find another place let's tunnel i don't want to go up no we can't tunnel it's night we can't travel at night there's vampires i feel like we're safer down here at least there's only so many places they can attack from that worked out really well because we probably wouldn't have defeated k'varn without him we're stupid what if we went up above ground and went into the second floor so we're not underground all right let's do it it's fine whatever we're very packed in it's nice and cozy and warm i stay awake because i don't want them to be alone sigil i need to sleep you need to sleep trinket stays awake with you though 17 oh not percy oh no how many can you get before you're totally evil plus there's probably dried food in this cellar is he the only one that was affected this time again grog give everybody a little bit of the dust of tracelessness yes yeah we're looking for a new hideout check in every 30 minutes it's dangerous meet back here in two hours-- hold on meet back here in two hours if we haven't heard from everything i was thinking dorito too how weird yeah i like it no have you you got it and vex has advantage oh right yes this is the dumbest idea by the way keyleth you and me all right and trinket and i'm sure he told everybody what we looked like we can't look like the same seeming that we were before yeah but he can write it down seeming we didn't i have crazy eyes they're like (growls) i cast pass without a trace on them before they leave on all of us oh there is i really should read about spells more oh within 30 feet of me speak up girl i can't hear you matt i'm sorry miss i'm sorry i'm jordana whisk i'm simon's daughter i'm trying to look straight at her but i'm really looking that direction and over there (whispering) lean in girl lean in dear the briarwoods aren't after us they're after everybody what we need is a place to stay that we know is protected (growls) eight is-- 16 80 60 do you miss the de rolos dear well we may know a couple de rolos we may know some no big deal only one person would know the entire name of percival de rolo de rolo iii magneto de rolo iii two greater healing and then another regular is it safe at night can i insight check her and see if she seems to be truthful i never know which one it's too much pressure to choose that was the wrong one i chose poorly 13 one's a child though you won't even notice him how is that even possible did you really puke or did you fake puke i want to watch people as they walk away and try to read their lips as they're walking away to see if everybody seems loyal to what he said or if anybody seems a little-- can we try to memorize their faces of everybody that was here yeah that was keeper i wink at him the what production are they supernatural are they undead against the briarwoods we heard about green fog here is that something do we know what killed the tree does she come out during the day i don't think she's a vampire what kind of distraction i like it the next attack will be on the briarwoods like a giant sparkler can you clear out clouds then if you can do that can you make these gray clouds go away well sunlight would be nice as opposed to this misty fog can you poke a hole in them is there just one of us who can make a big stink in the decoy house you could definitely make a big stink how about this i use one of my exploding arrows you gave me of what oh man you know what i forgot i-- okay cool just don't i have thoughts arrow of course because it's this fucking town it's fucked no offense it won't be fucked soon no come with us keyleth you won't die scanlan yeah oh how about this maybe we can tell scanlan to set off the thingy i'll come running out as my old crazy lady saying (screams) the house is under attack toward the guards guarding this house and then i'll just stand there as they react i thought we did stealthy stealth i cast pass without a trace on him huh i guess i stealth behind him oh no which one should i use add ten 36 (whispers) i can perch and take him out with an arrow do you want to sneak-attack him that might be smarter got it should we let scanlan do his thing first and then we sneak attack him set it all in motion and then we'll count to three and we'll attack yeah you do tell us when got it we're just going straight into the house yeah we go in the window oh but that's only grog in the front now i give him trinket going in with you he's going in the door oh my gosh but he is wearing a little petticoat we meant to announce that yeah it just released this week ashley fricking johnson sorry not sorry
