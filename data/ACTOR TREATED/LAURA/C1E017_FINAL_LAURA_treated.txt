weekend in baltimore come say hi we're leaving right after this i feel like we're just delaying starting because we're going to have to face that fact that pike isn't with us as soon as we start he's on his way yeah he's getting a drink what is he wearing just for the next eight months should we go look at that statue then pike's probably going to have to be the one to clean that up are you going to be able to see through the dump we're not there it's just scanlan he's just leaving it will she realize you can see her through the poop wouldn't that be great if she could just talk to you through the poo should we bunk for the night before we head out in the morning i wanted to wander over to the statue while scanlan was dumping i feel like it's dark now he's a dwarven god and it's nighttime so it's like a battleground have you ever fought in the crucible the money wait it costs money keep walking thank you friend sit-ups crunches hello how would we enter a new fighter into this pit 100

pointing at you oh god how was that ten baby that was 11 the first one was a five that's 11 i know oh no you distracted him yeah he's only using his arms because he's got no knees douche that was painful it's too bad pike didn't cast death ward on him before she left though that would've been great we'll need to earn our money back is there a whorehouse here in vasselheim that is what i was inquiring we'll get you ice cream grog and a whore how's that sound tiberius really we would love one of those for some of us not all of us no our bear will stay in the room with us girls no grog

druids secrety to kiss you kiss your family there are things about goliaths i did not want to know that water has a good effect on him inconvenience schminconvenience yes it's actually underdark i'm fluent yeah next time bite his nose off right away before it's concave the balls-- good effort speaking of weapons aren't we in a perfect weapons-buying district what about your beard is he growing his beard actually i don't know about anybody else but i'm incredibly low on funds at the moment getting ready where what are we doing can i grab the flying carpet out of the bag of holding before you take off i swing down and pick up my brother yeah we fly up next to one of the shooter guys and say what was it what is it what came back like a raptor kord help us good old kord okay can we float up a little bit and see if we can see movement in the trees where it is okay well here's the thing i bring the carpet back down and say i see where it went if you guys want to fight it what do you think polymorph him please scanlan please polymorph him we can track him i'm a ranger i can definitely use my ranger skills oh don't worry he's really nice yeah why are you being an asshole to me today i don't know (laughter) yeah can i go low to the ground and track it this is my other favored terrain oh natural 20 (cheering) is it big i think it ate something here you guys thank you should we continue on keep tracking yeah perception check around oh that looks good yeah only 18 for me but wait advantage that's way better 25 should we follow along that path but maybe off to the side a bit like in the trees but next to the path oh man another one 16 what do i need to add okay so 19 perception 18 natural 20 whoa is that a dragon so it's not technically in the dragon school it was a natural 20 do i add anything should i have rolled for trinket i rolled an 18 for trinket i can cast the spike-growth thing again in the water then lightning the water that's good drown him yeah box him in the water and then lightning the water do you want to go from either side you take the carpet go to the other side and i'll walk over with trinket to the other what is he looking for i'm going to do the same to the other side actually would i be able to shoot him from behind the one further back well then i'll go behind the big tree there yeah totally hidden can you move trinket next to grog there we go look at us all strategized i want to shoot him okay i'm going to cast hunter's mark on it so i'm going to cast hail of thorns at 3rd level i'm going to roll for that jesus that's only 16 that doesn't hit does it okay then i'm going to try just doing a regular attack through the magical bow of fire and that is 17 then never mind i don't do anything i just fucking fucked that up yeah i want to climb a tree that i'm next to what was that athletics or acrobatics why six i'm going to stay on the ground trinket's going to stay right there 19 wait but when hercules defeated him he just cut off so many that they started attacking themselves and they got tangled up can i see its body at all so i can't see its body okay i'm going to shoot towards where-- is this bad oh no i'm going to shoot towards where all of the heads are joined together yeah down where all these heads are connected right here i'm going to shoot my fancy exploding arrow oh god natural 20 you said 19 jesus all right can trinket run up and fight alongside grog all right he's going to do that gets two attacks because of bestial fury jeez okay i'm going to roll my trinket dice now don't kill me now okay i don't even know 16 cool 19 all right (fake-cries) okay 13 does he get hunter's mark yes he does that's another five oh you don't want to punch heads off blurs from the bush what well maybe you should've fought it before we got here wait what about the people that are near the hydra and it explodes in his face and he's knocked prone attack the hydra hey that's the best thing ever i bet if we keep doing it though i mean eventually the heads will outweigh the body and it'll just have to fall over so everything in that area you can't you already did it so 18 for the first one i don't want to say it but trinket's right there yeah i know you said that but he also attacked him already don't say it 17 for the first one it's stuck in there it was really on an angle that's unfortunate because one of them was good and one of them sucked seven trinket i get up and run over to trinket and hold his little head in my hands help him well no give us the money well the bastion up on the wall said we could so that's why we did it what do you mean aldor they told us we could kill it and then give the heads and then bring it in and then they would give us money why don't you just tell people you killed it we helped you get the money you give us half of it and we call it even oh can you stab it right now maybe it's still breathing no sean connery's talking now i'm sorry i mean i was going to ask them for a paycheck immediately after we'd gone back to the city but you know ooh can we help can i have a scale just one more scale oh you guys set that bait out you guys killed that ape didn't you not intentional skags it was attacking the wall we were protecting you i have enormous balls oh he's got giant balls as well that would be amazing remember it you two make an adorable couple they didn't do much but yes we have a keep there that's good because otherwise they didn't get any credit right because it was like magically-- yeah let's do it we're totally tough what does my bear get to come with me wait no we work as a pair maybe you don't know that about us ever question husband is there a way to change those little pairings that she made perhaps get my brother and i on the same team
