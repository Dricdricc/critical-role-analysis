all right yeah thank you guys they're really great let me see those trammels who has the trammels i just want to look at them all of them that's it i just want to hold them really yeah i'm cradling them grog can i tell which one is which god all right cool i'm going to hold on to the pelor one pass them back yeah i don't know if anybody else wants to hold one yeah he was only big fighting the bulette so you want us to leave outside the mansion you're out the mansion now have fun you two we're really sorry for everything scanlan you know we love you no i'm married that would be awkward yeah seriously i'm so amazed with both you and percy you really pulled through and we would be lost without both of you yeah that fight could've gone terribly and we pulled through as a team that was a great song scanlan you have four choices you want to what i walk up and i palm scanlan's forehead and slam him to the ground what the fuck are you doing i'm going to feel his forehead does he feel warm scanlan i don't blame you i don't this seems to be coming out of nowhere and he's married to me and i will cut you how much of an age difference i'm going to look into his eyes are his eyes dilated i'm going to sit directly between percy and scanlan for all of this conversation i have a 23 passive perception scanlan what i grab his fingers and start to bend them backwards i whisper in his ear do you want to keep playing your fucking lute or not seriously what the fuck is wrong with you how long have you felt this way because this is very fucking strange scanlan oh yeah is he still in the same place well shove your head out the door he hasn't moved at all where would that move him towards solid yeah do allura and gilmore and kima and everyone do they know what's going on have we sent word it'll be fine yeah i'm in the bed you motherfucker we're married scanlan shorthalt tell me now why i shouldn't feed you to trinket would we know that something is wrong what am i making insight okay fucking a it's a 12 but i rolled a three all i have is lesser restoration unless you're fucking with me i'm going to try lesser restoration here's the thing darling if something is wrong with him and this is so out of character i'm afraid something is wrong with him-- not that you're not completely desirable-- but he needs a good night's sleep and i'm afraid he won't get it in this i'm going to try lesser restoration on him i'm not sure if it'll work in case it's not don't do that anymore well fuck i got nothing scanlan seriously this is not acceptable go to bed if we let you out of this cage will you go to bed i'm going to send trinket to your room with you and he's going to sleep on top of you so that you will go to sleep yeah let's do that why why did you do it oh hey so vasselheim oh god what if vasselheim is a show of power they were only going to wait for us a couple of days and then they were going to head back i think the destruction of the world may be more important than 500 gold (shocked noises) or melora's tree maybe (laughter and applause) he's painting it on the door the guy in the city is that's the vecna symbol right fuck should we go up and talk to that guy you there dreams what dreams this symbol will not protect you because i know his followers they won't have mercy they'll gouge out eyes remove your hand and make you one of them okay hold on 17 yes we'll do our best that's what we're here for dear god i hope that works i don't think they noticed you grog is he already gone maybe it's best to not let people give him power because the more people believe in him the stronger of a god he becomes could you maybe make the sun reappear is it like ghostbusters yeah can you miracle more maybe above the sarenrae temple let's do it at the temple of sarenrae or the temple of pelor (whispering) we made them like so much he's listening right now look i'm sure you've realized by this point that vecna has ascended to godhood he's not reached his full power yet the only way it will happen is if he claims a great use of power he's on his way here the more followers he has the more power he has yeah so yeah he's got this ability allura does the sky look like this in emon we have the knowledge that we can't take him by surprise he sees everything yes so he can't hear us right now (sighs) it feels so good oh good call wait you'll make what i didn't hear it very true there is critical role live vox machina t-shirts silted veil and the crypts of tholmura and one is icy valley the other one is what zombie dwarves okay yeah we're mostly really good at that fuck come on shit fucked up because it's trinket it's a trinket cape yeah but thank you it's gorgeous yeah it's warm i'm already very warm no i think it was to liam vord does this need to be attuned (laughter) it's okay i'm going to sit down keep talking i'm going to try to attune while that's happening well we can't tell you you do that i'm un-attuning the bracers of archery in order to attune to this ring do you have a card that i can see i want that paper and what's the name of it exactly dracarys has it been long enough that it's attuned i don't want to talk about it for a little more time maybe we should just give up no you know what vecna's right i'm really worried about our family we should all split up and go be with our families right now maybe you should maybe we will let's do it no okay seriously that's too far it's too far don't i don't like it it looks fucking good it looks great grog okay fuck vecna we're not for vecna yeah i know change of heart so we have two options right what were you saying scanlan the stilted bale so wait we're going there why okay so we choose between those two as our strike place maybe it's best that we don't let anyone else know where we're going yeah because that way it'll all be a surprise did he i don't know what he heard i don't know how often he listens to us i don't know any of that does he have to actively listen or is it a passive thing i mean that's the thing i mean he's building an army and trying to take over the world i can't imagine he's listening to us all the time yeah but him he's doing things like he's got shit to do do we know what kind of creatures are in the icy veil could there be ice giants there would vecna want ice giants pike are you willing to leave the temple now you aren't abandoning them well okay but if you're astral projecting aren't you chilling in one room here not really communicating anyway 13 oh no but this can't be the only thing that determines if she's an astral projection or if she comes with us will everything work like normal if she's astral projection yeah we'll totally jaeger her if she's okay with it okay that's very true but if she's an astral projection can she still use the champion's blessing that she got from sarenrae and stuff motherfuck how do you know that do you know what kind of magic it is that keeps him from holding us just wondering you said there were kinds but i want to make sure that's good just making sure because i thought that was what it was i just wanted to double-check give gilmore a hug for us will you see what yeah well i'm glad i think they're taking care of the forces we're taking care of the god so he's basically wanting to raise a giant zombie titan full of zombie cannibal dwarves and then they'll poo them out to fight other people here's the thing are we relying on grog to stab these trammels through vecna it takes three separate attacks i'm assuming right or would it be attack attack attack (laughter) okay but it would be one of those situations where you'd have to attack and then draw another one and then attack right already before we even do that we do we're saying we don't have time to make a scroll spell scroll scroll spell scroll but it is a melee weapon i'm going to pass the pelor trammel back to you and it's not concentration right so you can also cast death ward and death ward lasts for eight hours sure is it yours he just hit snooze you guys it was all a dream what is it whoa okay so everybody take one superior right everybody gets one and there's one extra i'm going to mark down that pike has one scanlan's super important i know you're very fine and you're very capable yeah okay we are very how close oh shit i mean if he's already passed by the crypts is there any reason to go there i don't understand you want us to go fight vecna right now do it do it right now taliesin and are you zoning in on the city or are you zoning in on vecna can you scry on that death knight guy that was next to her we didn't kill him we did not kill him we did not hit him we did not (laughter) hey keyleth while we're flying through the air is it possible for you to give us a nice inspiring speech we're making a what an intelligence check is this an intelligence 21 does it look like a walking path a very large walking path do we see anything in the air any of those shadow creatures or is it just our wyvern riders natural 20 is the sinkhole in the direction of the city that's moving right now (shouting) that's the fucking titan it's the titan full of dwarf bodies i just realized that (laughter) shit i thought it was just a really big giant and then i remembered it was a titan at least 600 feet tall what did you say how are we going to fucking fight something that's 600 feet tall maybe we got to get inside of it are we on j'mon sa ord's back trinket's in the necklace for this part it could be that one's dead does that mean you can beat him up from the inside yeah do a what i'm going to cast pass without a trace on us it's not going to make any difference but i'm going to do it that would be one powerful fucking spell pike how strong are you feeling right now you got it you're a monster i think we should dive into one of the beehive tunnels and stealth in i think we should still be stealth mode j'mon can drop us off j'mon you distract all of the city with all of your wyvern riders as well and we'll come in from the bottom up yeah i'm going to guess too because he's asking out loud marisha and hey keyleth do you have any of that wild guide-- is that what's it called that herb that scares away the undead you should probably do that we could fall off this dragon's back real fast how many that leaves quite a few of us left maybe j'mon could you get-- they probably have seen us coming though they're on their way here i shoot one with an arrow 28 no that doesn't hit 15 invisible 25 let's go in there then let's fly in close to that waterfall oh god strength jeez louise god a 22 for me i know we wouldn't even know were they touching each other tell me they were good so you can bamf to her yeah let's head for the opening we have pass without a trace no can we see where to go to an opening let's just go (fake-crying) see you on the other side of the war
