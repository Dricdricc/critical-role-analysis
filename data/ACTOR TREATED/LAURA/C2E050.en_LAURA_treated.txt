things you know maybe oh and you know you can go to our us shop at shopcritrolecom and our uk shop shopcritrolecouk dotnothing else that's it roll the dice (singing) the adventure begins they were always beside you your nerdy best friends and the dm to guide you and they rise from the flames for the battles ahead villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead (singing) can you answer the call diggin' deep in your soul as the legend unfolds now it's your turn to roll [fire burning] going like you guys are being really stupid maybe it's not the smartest idea for us to do this is all i have 60 as well i am decently perceptive how about you oh no really caduceus i'll stay next to you fjord in the front good call i think it was going to be me and fjord at the front are you perceptive yasha can be at the back will nugget fit by yasha where else will i put him you know where would they stay okey dokey that would be 19 okay i have a question you guys i've got this super-secret dodecahedron thingy in my bag that yussa specifically said that we should not be bringing near anything and stuff and now we're taking it right to the source do you think that's a bad idea right unless they capture me and flip my bag inside out and then they have it yeah i don't know it's in my bag as well i've got the whole setup going right and we're only fighting an entire army of soldiers so it probably won't happen that we will die that's true yasha you think it'll be nice that's true what's in this pocket o' cavern anything cool yeah it's pretty t top are there footprints on the ground 15 how big of a trail is the worm thing is it like this is it like this cool so we're fighting these guys and a giant worm creature that is ten feet in width so he's probably kind of long i mean i'm not going to lie nott i am a little bit nervous yeah well yeah remember what i did to-- oh you weren't-- remember when i turned that dragon into that little thing that's what i could do to a worm i guess i did that to the dragon before you came in you know when we almost died good call yeah or something maybe like a sparrow or something so it will fly away like a dire honey badger ooh that's good i like that fjord also though i can't do that until we sleep but i don't think we're going to run into them today right because they're probably really far ahead of us because they got a two week lead traps too i wonder if there's another big pocket o' cavern coming up or if we have to sleep in this little tunnel mm-hmm again 17 magical things live here i bet kill it why would you kill it it was so beautiful yeah let's sleep in here is the ground covered in crystal too yeah maybe me too me too it's pretty this is true i agree with fjord wait i'm going to use sending i'm going to send a message to yussa and i'm going to say-- shit i didn't have time to write it out hello it's jester we're bringing that dodecahedron with us we're on our way to (whispering) i can't remember the name of the-- xhorhas do you think it's dangerous should we not please respond to this message yeah right i think he's cool with it mm-hmm yeah i mean unless somebody wants to keep a watch and make sure nothing comes by get a good night's sleep can you put a night light on though because it's really pretty go for it okay okay okay 19 again do i see any movement in it there's a chamber ahead of us it sounds wet nott i know i know i didn't think we'd have to deal with a water issue down here there could be an underground river i don't know or yeah it could be that or it could be a water monster when we approach it i'm going to cast pass without a trace on all of us and we'll approach it stealthily what do you guys think about that okay we're approaching it stealthily add ten oh what is everybody going 24 sam and plus ten what would be above us yeah where are we we could figure out where we are where's the map yeah but we know which direction we're going we're under the big river then maybe good point oh we have to find it i guess we should search around and see if we can find a hole in the wall follow their path or something i will look for a hole in the wall nein wait plus-- 14 holes in the walls i bet the rock formations in this room are amazing that one looks like a fried egg look at that do you see it looks like an egg on the top do you see i probably should (gasps) oh my god i should make this a temple to the traveler yeah but think about how cool it would be if someone came down here and they were like what's going on and then they find like-- yeah yeah yeah and then they like they find it they're going to be like that is like so important i must definitely worship this guy because and it will at least get one person you know added-- i don't i'm just going to i'm going to paint you know a really nice picture of the traveler then i'm going to use my paint-- my special paint-- and i'm going to make a nice little figurine of the traveler and i'll sit it on top of the best-looking rock formation that looks like it's definitely for him i'm going to paint like pretty things around him like sparkles and shit i'm going to put it on the little squat one but then put some of the crystals that i got in my pocket like around it then on the tall formation i'm going to write the traveler is the tits worship him like vertically they yeah we all took luck right we all took luck oh see think about how-- what are those things so wait where are we putting the traveler stuff okay oh it's so cool no it's real bad oh i didn't roll i know but i thought you said don't because they got a surprise oh no six lot of twelves i'm really distracted you know because i'm-- i'm painting a beautiful-- oh my god we're going to die it hits me oh no maybe the next turn they will swallow us whole oh my god wait was that all just one creature attacking us or was that-- okay if i go unconscious right away-- this was really fun guys i went out doing what i love (pained noises) can i use my hellish rebuke okay is it okay ah okay okay okay oh god 3d10 damage (screams) ooh 19 points of cold damage oh it's a dex save yes what is that other purple thing on him he's hexed woo okay i'm going to turn since that one's letting me go and i'm going to put my hand towards the other one i'll say get the fuck out of my temple i'm going to cast banishment yeah that's a charisma save it needed a 16 save so-- well he wouldn't have done that here he'll only be gone for a little bit we should probably get out of here also kill this guy huh then i turn back to the dude that's in front of me yeah i can't do anything else i don't think yeah that's all i can do i really hope you guys kill it before it gets back to its turn hi fjord thank you we should leave not long at all like probably another minute or so so run there's not-- it's rocks it's like beef jerky 12 yeah same i'm going too oh it's back good but it's got a 50-foot reach oh yeah that's right we can shoot at it it's not within range of sacred flame guiding bolt 13 points oh wait i didn't roll to attack i'm an idiot oh that definitely hits 19 plus eight so that was 13 points is it within 60 feet of us yet toll the dead bong it's getting really close so it's going to be able to grapple us again very soon yay i need a heal i think they were a couple you guys i think they've been living down here for a long time they were this wonderful couple (gasps) little rock babies maybe that's why they were mad maybe the crystals we took were their rock babies what if it was their giant baby nest and we broke their babies out i think we're the only two that got hurt then i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself as well at 2nd-level yeah no joke i don't think there's anything that would really help us down here that i could paint yeah i actually do have the ability to command things but they have to be able to understand me and i didn't think that those rock things probably spoke our language well you know we could have said pretty please you don't know i could try it next time ooh 24 yeah nothing can get through it anyway i'm going to cast sending i'm going to cast sending for yeza i'm going to say it's me again can you let us know if you've been on the move or if you're staying in the same place are you in the tunnels still (whispers) shit he's already in the city we're not going to be able to ambush them you guys yeah that's a bad one eight sorry guys i rolled really well yesterday though (singing) 66 bottles of beer on the wall 66 bottles of beer (strained singing) 21 bottles of beer on the wall-- i use thaumaturgy every time he says it to make the bing-bong noise same deal i'm going to send a message to yeza s'me again how long were you in these tunnels do you know how do you feel we're on the way your wife misses you a lot she loves you shit i thought that meant i used two i had three left shit she loves oh no i just think somebody was-- he wasn't alone this time and he couldn't respond is all yeah he just said i can't so i was like oh okay that's all no like i can't talk to you he basically said i can't talk to you right now i'm busy i think he was in the middle of dinner yeah it'll be okay nott it'll be okay i'm going to use a spell yeah sure we've been making food i can't do the spell i was going to do because i forgot i didn't have it prepared but maybe tomorrow yeah it's true if those cone-head thingys come out again i don't want any of you not being aware of what's happening oh beau you know what we could do here take this i'm going to give her the smutty book that you gave me just recently wait wait wait read it out loud now we can all have entertainment while we're walking i mean normally it doesn't take but-- i know thank you caleb do we hear anything coming from the tunnels what were you thinking caduceus i read scary books when i was little about these creatures that lived in the mountains that were see-through because they lived underground for so long but they had really long claws and they would snatch up babies i'm just saying maybe we should avoid them what if it's not a miner from the top what if it's one of the creatures that i was talking about and this is his hammer and the tunnel actually-- no what if it's a creature that lives in the mountain and he's got a hammer and one of these tunnels leads to his village under the mountain and it's a whole village of scary people that's going to attack us as soon as we-- (whispering) to go poop because there's not really a lot of privacy-- wait wait wait i have an idea what if i cast daylight we could tie a ribbon around frumpkin's neck i cast daylight on his neck on the ribbon and then he can see wherever he goes hey that's better than that i take a ribbon off my horn and wrap it around frumpkin's neck oh caduceus he can't hear us when he's doing these things what'd you see how big of a creature did it seem cute that's a good point fjord that is what we're doing me too yeah bring him back yeah go down the little ones cool i cast pass without a trace on all of us while we were hiding is that okay okay eight oh no stop them author extraordinaire i cast disguise self and make myself look like a giant one of them i act like i'm saying it also tell them that i'm their god oh man i was trying to make it look like i was talking caleb argh his coat up yeah what does it say he sounds very intimidating right now yay we can make food oh aww yes little me's we have food for you worship me i am your leader 12 yes we bring food for you it's good what about the leader-- your leader can i go i came because i'm a really good friend of yours i'm a leader here and also i just wanted to go through with my friends yes that's all of us then huh we can go then then the leader and then we had the friends with the-- then the guy that's hanging that's important too definitely yeah i don't want them ganking our stuff i've got my hands on our stuff the whole time nugget come on oh yeah question about that did you see how many of them there were with the big worm the guys that made a big mess how long ago do you know did it seem like a lot of people how big was the worm that's true it's kind of-- they understand us no don't eat it i mean we shouldn't let it just die i'm not going to trade nugget no no i mean i don't want it to suffer in a cage caleb (snarling) let's open it up sam and yay it's alive thanks caleb yeah they're so cute mm-hmm yeah yeah and then we'll go to sleep mm-hmm good idea put on a show i think they need some entertainment yeah yes oh i'm feeling so tired also i'm not a giant lizard anymore i'm not a big kobold i'm me again that's right i can take any form i want yes i'm glad everyone worships me like they should i walk around dramatically for a while it's going to be so hard to find wood down here in the tunnels not yet no oh my god hey bees a natural 20 i'm going to cast command at second le-- no yeah second level and try to get both of them and say stop it no both of the yeah but it's still within range yes wisdom saving throw they both have to stop it i mean spurt and bex oh we don't have any food we already gave you all the food you guys what the fuck are you doing you're so cute and stuff but like don't attack us we're really big yeah no i'm going to kill them (whispered) i'm not going to kill you don't worry what's a centipault that's awesome but not on us don't attack us okay i'm going to open my sketchbook and draw all of it don't worry we'll heal you that's really cool is it alive no ugh 15 no don't beat it poor pepé stop hitting it yeah oh hello bees hi bees hey spurt how long have you lived down here 11 days except we're leading him to a really scary place y'all we shouldn't pull that shit out that could be a really bad idea caleb yeah you want to come with us hey this kid thinks you're his mom can we see what it is oh no spurt don't run i love him what are we rolling stealth i rolled an 11 should i be rolling stealth checks for nugget how are we going to get out of here ooh you know what we should do we should mark this on the map we could create a diversion hold on let me see what kind of spells i have taken i bet that these people are posted here because the kryn came through oh yeah you can't see the actual figure so potentially-- okay i have an idea what if caleb you make your bubble then one of us just yells out to the fire giants hey we just want to pass through we don't want to have anything to do with you we're just chasing down these dicks that passed through your land that's it then we hide in your bubble so that they can't attack us well yeah but what are we going to do we can't all be invisible and they're right here they can't get us through the bubble you don't think they're going to have other sentries posted when they leave their post i'm just saying in the tunnel it's just an extra bonus of being in the tunnel and extra protection or something which i don't want to do i just want to talk to them yes i could do it yeah can you make it look like it comes from the cave and then runs off so that it doesn't appear out of nowhere or the other cave maybe no i don't know or just come out of the lava oof but it could also succeed against us and then we'll have to fight a giant i think it would be better if you know i could dimension door with you caleb over to the other side and then we just keep going we never engage with these fucks well he's going to make a big distraction and then we all run shut up wait which library was this yeah then we all run go the distance can you get that far too somebody take caleb i'll take yasha why yeah she's not large i could blessing of the trickster you here and that way you're a little more stealthy as you're going i could polymorph someone into something that you know— yeah that can get across i could polymorph i could polymorph you and i could dimension door me and yasha one of us needs to take yasha one of us needs to take caleb i'll take yasha i thought you could go farther than that fjord that's not as far wait how about i take caleb the entire distance you and yasha bamf 90 feet and run because caleb is squishy do you want to be polymorphed okay well i won't be able to polymorph you once you're out do you keep your intelligence when you're polymorphed here beau don't take it out just let it in okay i'm going to blessing of the trickster you you're still super stealthy i don't know if it matters what nugget's just going to run out and he's going to blink and blink and blink as far as he can yeah he's going to be fine it gives you advantage on stealth checks he was so cute okay what should i make you what do you want to be maybe a dragonfly could be really cool okay well if you're a dragonfly will you remember what you're supposed to do if you cast polymorph-- if i were to cast it on myself i would remember what i was doing no sprinkle's in my pocket i actually have a question matt when i dimension door i can take another creature does that mean i can't have sprinkle on me or else i won't be able to take caleb okay i'm going to take sprinkle off out of my hood okay beau take care of sprinkle no it's okay sprinkle just hold onto him when you run okay don't let him get left behind it's sprinkle he's my weasel nugget's going to blink blink blink polymorph polymorph plus it's expecting something to come out the door it's right at the top of your-- if you hit spells it'll say at the top what is it is it a natural 20 are they looking at each other should we-- do we have any other thingies hold on well should we just wait until it dies down then go natural 20 20 plus four 24 who would attack the cow what did yasha roll hey caleb polymorph happens immediately so you can do it again oh you're at the bottom i'm going to run up grab caleb and dimension door to the other side nugget's going to run and starts running out and fucking blinking as well oh my god oh no he's so cute with the-- oh we did you can go 30 feet he is going straight through the lava but there's a bridge what the cow gets you low damage to the cow roll three ones three ones you're invisible and i blessed you it gives you advantage on stealth how long can you stay invisible but with blessing of the trickster it might be balanced out because you get advantage on-- does that drop your invisibility once you're hit yeah she's still invisible big fire giants they are really-- sure yes i am going to yeah i'm going to just pop my head and out and see what's happening and i'm going to cast jesus fuck okay i'm not concentrating anymore i'm going to invoke duplicity i'm going to send my duplicate 30 feet in front of me and then i'm going to make her run out and leap over the lava and land on the other side and then she's going to act like she's readying for the fight and getting ready to cast something okay god fucking dammit seven you don't know where nott went you could prep a healing for when you see nott saving throw if she would have rolled a one would she be in the lava no can you leap on the crumbled bridge parts lava fire damage is what you're looking up right now i remember this being ludicrously horrible and that was before we did the full lava damage yeah i got a better plan do you have the ability to roll back time okay yeah i'm going to run up with my duplicate and cast inflict wounds at 3rd-level just kick him 17 plus eight 25 5d10 oh 30 (counting) 36 points that's-- yeah i mean that's all i could do or-- no that was my action heal nott or put the fire out or something you guys can put the fire out on nott at least oh my goodness gracious that was lovely also poster and prints in the store now art prints i'm still talking like jester and we still have our awesome shirt
