yeah ahh totally don't say 'seemingly' don't say 'seemingly' yeah yeah garmelie the hag right yeah no he warned us about i am not feeling the hag the hut of wodenna it could be garmelie's gone however she is aware of our presence now isn't she yeah we know we know that is not where the bow is i know it's so terrible i want to like explore everything here because-- forsythia yeah kind of like when i dove into the river right true no we don't we really don't yes you do and we've been do-si-doing the whole time we've been having this conversation definitely i think we need to not go towards the hut to the tree to scariness this is that time he does he has he has one time don't let's just sneakily go off and just not pay any more attention to this charming little tree this is true ugh stealthily walk away from the hut do we still have pass without a trace going or do i need--no it dropped it dropped because we fought something so i would need to cast it again which i do cast again pass without a trace um maybe dust of tracelessness behind us so the hag doesn't feel tempted to maybe follow in our footsteps grog please flower-girl please you're terrible that's terrible soon we just killed the crocodile plant we just killed a crocodile plant seriously we just fought something just did that let's walk away oh high hopes pass without a trace i cast pass without a trace did you get a 20 did you get a 20 on it aw oh come on (all laugh) they are there's no excuse now i think it's just a curse on you marisha no we used pass without a trace though so add ten 36 pike no can we see if the door shut did the door shut um 25 okay no that's no she didn't get like stolen or something away maybe the hag cast a dispell she did on the broom love you pike definitely something you said seriously okay so she's that's good keyleth what direction was the big scary blight on the land so we head that direction keep an eye out for anything moving shit anything seemingly aggressive it went away that's a lot coming from grog it's good you can keep an eye out for the hag following behind us yes i am tracking a little bit ahead of them what did it look like just movement (mouthing) we should go we should go that way percy look over there with your eyesight look through your little scope and see what you see oh (whispering) we need to be very quiet oh so we've killed them before that's good to know they were-- yeah just you know maybe go around what do you think well there's two of them that we see didn't wait-- didn't tiberius turn into a lady-troll oh they could be smarter they could be like hag trolls which is just terrifying which could be us very soon we need to keep moving the longer we stand still the more stuck we get well how about we don't move at all right now can we get up in the trees can we try and climb the trees well no we can go from tree branch to tree branch are they tightly enough connected that we can travel on the top of the trees i'm gonna get on the broom and fly up i wanted to yeah sure i'll break the canopy oh shit why didn't i go above the canopy before wow okay i say i see the tree and i come back down into the canopy can i come down and grab keyleth and lift her up into the tree too you're not gonna go up in the tree i don't know yeah i think so i feel like the trolls are gonna pop up like somewhere near us you're against the tree while that's going on can i fly down and get percy out of the muck and bring him up into the tree oh shit oh shit what the fuck i should get scanlan grog get in the tree get in the tree tree please aw seriously gorillas are pretty fucking smart i think they'd be smarter than grog they can learn sign language they have like an entire yeah oh shit scanlan do you want to ride on grog's back still or do you want to come up in the tree can i go down and grab scanlan and put him on the broom with me okay yeah yeah no wings for you yeah yeah again yes yeah that worked really well last time totally somebody can he had the carpet before so maybe not so much but the whole point was for the trolls to not have us on the ground the trolls but can we just try to travel amongst the trees yes shit do you wanna carry scanlan i feel like we could-- yeah that's true and your wings are much larger than hers were yeah and i've got a skinny little broom so i'm not flapping any wings yes well (marisha laughs) then i guess i can take one of you on the broom with me do you wanna hop on this since you have no flight brother all right he's on the broom with me not parkouring not parkouring through the treetops oh oh okay do we wanna go straight for the tree now or do we wanna like rest up before we do that watch it and see what's going on with it before we just go straight to it yeah yeah that's a long time all right oh jeez around the tree around it i wanna kind of perch on top of a tree nearby and just kind of see it from there like bleeding out oil mm sounds tasty can-- -- we see any kind of movement any kind of things moving around the tree okay that would be 30 oh shit i think the tree is alive and not in a normal plant sort of way yeah fuck i do not wanna get close to that thing god i hope so thanks scanlan your eyes your eyes ugh no what the base of the fucking tree no fucking way don't do that yeah can we see him walking towards it fuck percy are you on the ground do you see any sort of animal life around the tree the only thing i've seen is actual branches moving like arms i think the tree's alive like the trolls do you guys think maybe we should um we should get in the mansion and have a nice little chat and figure out what the fuck we're gonna do yeah about how long though you wanna fly down we fly down i take the broom and try to find a log all right (laughs) yeah that's interesting i got fifteen yeah okay all right hi grog gross come on so foul (singing) mansion it up swamp shoes so you can walk like me that's good oh i feel like is it bad do we get any kind of bad vibe bad energy off the muck no but i mean what if it makes us sad to be around it nineteen nineteen okay stanky-stank swan dive we're in the tree tops shit trees you're so lovely even though you're covered in this black stuff i can tell that you have really good personalities shit i push off we're flying we're hovering what about you grog oh no oh my god you rolled 19 twice in a row oh okay oh no oh no can we drop the endless rope down say hey grab on and try to yank 'em back up into the tree oh i was on the broom i've been on the broom yeah i don't wanna stand on anything can i tie the rope off on a branch we just need to get in the fucking mansion yeah we should-- should one of us lick it ew do you feel evil more than usual okay hold out your hand then well i have a seat sorry i didn't think about i'm gonna come out of the door with you oh wow that's three inspirations you've just given him i feel like keyleth a swan dive is maybe not the best idea because i feel like it'll make a lot of noise maybe nice and quiet short rest right now so keyleth can go into the muck i'm gonna go outside with her and just hover on the broom to keep an eye do you wanna hang out on the broom with me wow grog's getting aggressive oh smart smart do you wanna check on that all right scanlan do you wanna actually sit on my lap so you don't have to suffer through the indignity that vax just did whatever you want darling you're earth elemental i'm gonna hand vax the endless rope and say you might just wanna drop that down to the muck so she can get out if she needs it maybe like fish for her to the tree you're going to the tree yeah before she went in yeah yeah yeah are you okay oh right cool awesome did you see any creatures around do you wanna go maybe okay grog because you're super tired oh you're not an earth elemental anymore that's too bad wait do they feel pain go downstairs grog all right yeah we haven't looked at the spa since we destroyed it oh no you did punch a cow ohh no i hated it when you punched the cow no that is awful i leave i can't watch i go and look for chicken it's still a cow it's still a cow don't that's good awesome don't hit him don't hit him you need to rest so you can perceive things better oh natural 20 (all laugh) oh my god oh my god i'm gonna go up to grog and cast cure wounds at third level ten whole points of healing we'll plan tomorrow morning i wanna go upstairs and just open the door and keep an eye out of it for just a little bit and see what i see out the doorway oh come on oh um that would be a 15 well at the door how much time can i spend and still get a good rest oh right well how about a couple hours 17 disappear i dunno a giant werewolf eating an entire tree the tree like disappeared oh i bet something was sitting in the tree maybe and was keeping still that could be it can i look down underneath us and see if the trees are kind of staying put where we are it seems bigger than a creature would be holy moly wow maybe the hag can just move her hut magically whenever she wants do you think that's possible but the big scary tree that's staying still what direction was it coming from all right shit i guess i shut the door that's creepy i don't know who i would talk to about that can i go find keyleth are you asleep yet oh okay so you guys are together oh look at those beautiful shoes they're lovely no no those look great (grog voice) those shoes suck can i sit down oh this is true that was your very first-- can i sit down and start playing with the shoes and um ask keyleth do you know of anything that would cause entire trees to vanish well i was staring at the door and all of a sudden around a space about three trees just disappeared no like they dropped and there's a hole in the canopy do you know of anything that would cause that would we have learned anything about that in our studies maybe just don't use them anymore they're so nice and-- maybe just put them on display maybe put them in a really pretty glass case turn 'em into jewelry did it look like they dropped down though or did it look like they dropped over yeah so it is like oil sunlight and water not here might not need the same thing maybe it eats living creatures and we did see those branches moving like actual limbs on a being as opposed to branches on a tree it could be like a venus flytrap i think that's a very viable option possibly fenthras is that elven i think it's already poisoned give it sunlight sunlight and water fresh water (laughs) abba music you have honey can you make honey in your-- you can make fresh water in that jug though can't you maybe i don't know i think that could be a very scary prospect when you talked to the trees around you did it seem like they were actually alive or was it all dead forest that we've been traveling through yeah maybe before we sleep can you talk to the nature are you friends with the big tree how can we help oh what if it's a big scary creature not actually a tree yeah do you want to hang out on the broom so you don't actually step-- well i just don't want anybody to actually stand on a tree for very long right oh jeez i just send things down onto her we're just staring out the door down at her we aren't listening to this (laughs) terry remember we asked if it was an actual tree if it's an actual tree (whispers) who is sondur (gasps) pull her out pull her out what do you mean sondur is that a band what is it is it an elven word that we've heard does it sound i mean what would those names mean right and he's a dick so the tree probably is too that is how it works vex and vax do you have a library here oh we have to go to your actual bedroom do we have salt do we have lots of salt here in the mansion scanlan oh but we can't bring it out we can't bring it out i don't know if 12 gallons is enough to kill a tree yeah what if the-- i feel like we probably should've done some research on fenthras before we came out here look in your library i am following you to your library yes that's right that's right yeah but i listened to her real hard when she was talking aw man i don't think i wrote it down i think i was just listening fenthras no that's all i wrote i was so excited 'cause i saw it written down but no i didn't write i'm sorry i didn't write it down dammit balls but i have a real good-- okay okay okay shit history 17 is what i rolled okay that jogged my memory a little bit i sort of remember sondur what exactly is an archfey oh archfey okay okay so we know how to fight the tree okay maybe we can talk to it maybe if we call out to him he'll talk to us you're so charming or we have to talk to him and find out and maybe in the morning we're gonna talk to sondur and see you know why are you acting this way oh no look at his face he looks like that is a very bad idea yeah yeah yeah like how can we help you why are you hurting no no don't even bring up the bow right now let's just try to help him out i mean if we did cleanse the land that would be a wonderful thing the bow is a wonderful thing i have a pretty fucking cool bow now i don't even know if this new one's gonna be as cool you don't even know what mythcarver does titanstone knuckles aren't advancing at all who knows maybe this bow is shit and the whole point of this is so we can help people maybe we just think it's really cool yeah yeah like we've heard tale and it's wonderful we don't have bacon ooh that actually sounds really good oh shit i'm pretty tired what's up oh yeah um yes i don't know it's the weirdest thing i never realized how much it affected me until we actually were faced with it again it was good standing in front of him with everyone else wasn't it thank you i mean i can't give back the title that would be kind of shit baroness no baroness actually just a little bit cooler than before just a little i won't it's all an act dear i love you thank you go get some sleep your feathers are all ruffled can i go knock on percy's door before we head downstairs just really fast um percival sorry good morning i forgot you're grumpy when you wake up look vax came and talked to me last night and he actually reminded me of something that i forgot to say to you which is thank you seriously we haven't really had a moment to say anything and really what you did back in syngorn was more than i ever expected and honestly it's i don't know of any other time that somebody has stuck up for me quite as much outside of vax so thank you right question though because i sort of realized being a baroness of whitestone that i literally owe my fealty and allegiance to you all right okay thank you grand sire de rolo and if there's anything you ever need in return all you have to do is ask it was quite wonderful oh oh that's what so technically we gave it to zahra didn't we okay all right good that would be very strange wouldn't it only sometimes dear does it have to do with the hunt not not a given we might die today i'm gonna get some coffee thanks grog uh-uh oh wait how long does protection against poison last oh it's only an hour okay so no i don't want to cast it yet i do aren't you going to try to talk to it i can only cast it on one person though keyleth i don't have i'm not as good with spells as you so if you can do it to multiple people it might be good (posh voice) fancy what oh like a fancy-- heroes' feast i don't know if we have-- we should've done it last night if we were gonna do it it's gonna be fine we're all gonna die how are you guys
