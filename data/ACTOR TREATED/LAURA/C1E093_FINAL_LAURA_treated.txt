no there's officially 30 sets left according to-- 30 sets there are 30 sets left in the store we will be ordering more so there will be more but i don't know when that's you know going to come in so 30 sets for the time being good job guys that got them you critters there is a bear in it yeah she said her name i wrote it down i also wrote down chain devils know i don't know what that note meant about the bastion of flesh is that what it was it was just chain devils know period that too oh god that quickly huh 24 what'd you roll no you go there's no other entrance we really should have gone up and looked at it up close before kill him i was just thinking because it's at the same time technically our moves could i send trinket in well that way trinket's next to him so that my brother gets better-- doesn't he get better-- i think so yeah could he get there oh god that is so scary i don't know now that i'm saying it if that's the way to go here's my question while he's figuring out his shit if trinket falls and i don't see him does he still come into raven's slumber if it's within 100 feet or do i have to have visual (gasps) matthew mercer then he's going to do that so that you have a better attack on him motherfuck whatever just keep saying that i'm going to back up next to tova wait who's the big guy what's that big thing is that doty okay i'm going to get closer to doty and i'm going to hold my attack until i have visual and then i'm going to have trinket attack him since i don't have visual on him right now as my bonus move so he's just going to get one attack you said i can get my attacks and then have trinket be my bonus action because he can do one attack as my bonus action single attack on bonus for bestial fury all right he's going to just be in there roaring get them trink he's going to roll a 21 yay whoa that's a 15 well he's a really magically charismatic masseuse-- does it do any damage i attack okay two against-- i want to do bramble shot as my first attack okay oh 30 okay so i get sneak attack because trinket's next to him okay 4d8 seven plus ten is 17 17 just for that brambleness and then he has to roll a strength saving throw of dc 17 okay 15 17 plus three is 20 three lightning damage of that and then sneak attack is another six so that's the first attack second attack what was that 21 all right what's five plus eight is that 13 13 15 with two lightning damage 16 17 am i allowed to move back at all or duck under the window well i probably can't hide isn't that a bonus action so if i just move out of the way okay towards doty okay i'm not next to the window anymore (sing) come inside and only magical weapons can damage them or they have resist on non-magical weapons based on my lack of trinket attack fullness i'd like to think one of your antlers caught and you're like (yelps) yeah it was good what color is pit fiend blood (gasps) percival i'm standing in the corner looking at him like (whispers) what are you fucking doing that was sick he did another gesture what gesture what did he do oh no people are watching what about trinket trinket's got a really good sense of smell wait with his keen sense of smell-- okay 17 plus-- what does he add to it anything oh wow 17 plus nine 26 yes yes ah i love this don't fuck me gil oh gil did he get an advantage though because he sniffed out people damn it nine 29 did you already ask if the pit fiend took damage because you took damage just singeing we can see through the fire natural 20 how are we going to get him out of those flames man don't you have spells you have so many spells okay so i'm going to come up in front of the window great can i hunter's mark the pit fiend that's fine i know where he was right trinket is facing him so can i try to shoot him with an arrow anyway i have sharpshooter i don't know if that helps at all okay let's try this out those are being aggressive the lower of the two rolls was 29 okay i know right those fire-proof arrows great if i shot an arrow from a blazing bowstring so it was already a fire arrow you think it would go through okay i'm going to do that 19 well it could have been cool okay trinket is going to use his bonus action to try to attack him even though he's not magical and he's a little piece of shit that is a 26 yeah go trinket yeah that's good too that's a 15 yeah and i'm going to tell trinket back the fuck out of the fire trinket what are you doing stop attacking get out of the fire yeah and then i'm going to back away from the window i'm going to back away from the window just into the corner like where the angle of the wall is yeah right there and i'm going to back away from the window to where he doesn't have visual on me yeah of course come on trink travis noelle and it almost was really good but it wasn't six you did that to an animal you're evil make it better i like how the music stopped while we figure this out balls do you add anything to it tary it's your only friend oh my god can you use luck use luck that's molten blood he said eat it utugash do you get advantage because he's prone what if you jump on him you could jump on him did you take something how much damage did he just do with one turn not to the other corner where there's probably-- no what's your ac oh no he's pulling things out are you alive tary if i pop through the window will i be able to get out of the window i want to pop through the window get trinket in the locket that's what i'm going to do first go buddy i'm going to hop back through the window can i let him back out of the locket from there or-- that's my whole fucking turn fall over and be unconscious is what doty would do matt can i use my bonus action to at least hide 23 didn't you roll an eight you seriously need to stop using that one what is a blood maladict (grog voice) i have advantage ooh that's good travis and that's your whole action oh can you imagine if you had been attacking the pit fiend it is really hard to see some of these people oh my god oh no tary what are you doing concentration on oh right but wait what did the next melee attack do to you 20 points okay hey i can see him now i don't know what all i could see of that other than just the pit fiend's arm through the window but i'm going to back up and shoot him i'm going to hunter's mark him first though and i'm going to-- yeah that's what i'm going to do through the window yeah sure whatever great (sighs) i hate you hunter's mark well you know the first one is a one (grunts in pain) all right that's fine i'm going to hit him again though or try that is-- i can add-- 23 yes okay yes 18 plus one lightning damage plus 2d6 here we go and two ones i'm rolling great woo all of these all of you guys are goodbyes and you're a goodbye too you can stay huh how much was that oh 19 total one of those was lightning damage i'm going to back up i can use the rest of my movement right and back up around that corner so i'm parallel with percy there yeah right there i just have a quick question since i i haven't used this very much the disengage feat that the rogues have is that a bonus action okay just checking oh it was those fucks a fire giant are you attached to him that made up for all the rest of the times he fucked us during this game just say it i want to hear you say it that die's so much better 19 i'm going to run over to percy and give him a kiss and say nice shooting stud and i'm going to help him look i shout through the window loot the body and i keep looking in the things with percy (sings) yeah putting that in the stash 12300 you said i shoot an arrow into it 21 18 he should've listened you were very clear dear some spicy meatball i'm going to pop trinket out of the necklace and cast cure wounds on him wait they're in the prison wait does the bastion of flesh sound familiar as she's saying this trinket goes and grabs some of the rotting meat out of one of those and brings it to her as a present are you still a bear would you know your way around if you went back to the prison i mean do you think you'd know your way through the halls terrible idea no i don't know what you're talking about tary yeah maybe we should get out of here but being very careful for traps because they are present here what are you fucking doing ew what is that this is definitely what we talked about yeah of course i don't know i get trinket back in the necklace really fast i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself really fast why (high-pitched) we surrender this is a good plan good plan no this is the part where c-3po is being pulled apart no killer 31 i breathe a little easier gross great can't wait you fall unconscious that's a break of contract all right i saw this movie (laughter) oh shit i missed the last thing that he said i got all the directions but i didn't hear the very last thing that he said door with a grin wait i got right left straight straight left straight right no i want to try to lockpick too not the one in my mouth okay how about this i'm going to pop trinket out of the necklace-- i grab the necklace and i go trinket get out trinket get us out of here hey okay here's the thing can you go over and get anything out from between those two bars on the outside of the room did you get that okay back away maybe you can try and just break through these manacles can you do that okay okay okay 17 i want to pull my leg at the same time and see if i can help him out at all should've had him do this to grog okay (laughs) i suck at strength checks okay 15 great i have an ankle free hey guys guess what my ankle's free i am really flexible this does nothing yeah keyleth what can you do what the fuck keyleth can you do that to all of us yeah just get the lockpicks do you have any extra you can pass them to me and i can maybe help just fucking let me out of this i want to go over and start trying to do the lockpick oh actually i don't have any lockpicks on me still do i yeah thanks he gives me a spare and i start trying to work on the door while he's doing the others out the doors so i can get our shit what do i add to it 27 jesus wait not yet it's quieter to do this just come over and-- yeah it's really really tough i could have done the chains on all of us and you could have done this but whatever you're going through my bones twins now you've got to but quiet try to do it quietly just quiet just quiet motherfucking door no no no he's been doing everybody that's a six that's a 1d6 hey great i reach through and try to grab everything in pass it out okay i cast-- i cast pass without a trace on all of us nope i think it would be best if maybe we i mean i don't know how well we can stealth around here if we should maybe turn into insects and just crawl around here i think we should do that but i've definitely got a pass without a trace still on us solid copy on that but maybe those little insects are immune to the fire since they live here wait we can't be those little-- oh really not insects maybe hummingbirds something the teensiest bird you can think of we can't be insects we can only be animals yeah so teeny teeny teeny like finches or hummingbirds ooh bats down here whatever as long as we're flying maybe we can be stealthy we'll be stealhty bats so we can just shift in and out whenever we want with an action okay i think getting-- yeah we should it's easier to not get caught and then we'll stealth as bats sure i think we'll just-- there's a lot of demons around here devils yeah you don't speak the shit so even if you have it-- stealthy bats we fly close to the ceiling and be as quiet as possible i'm solid with the bat but i'm going to lead the way since i'm good with directions oh but we can still see where we're going is it echolocation only okay right flying close to the ceiling stealthy okay fly with purpose fly with purpose as soon as we get to a thing we turn left at least they're letting us go right now left oh wait no we haven't gone left yet yes and now we're going to turn left plus ten i'm going to say trinket's back in the necklace by the way okay no that was me i did that 34 just keep flying let's go through them avoiding the bars avoiding the bars fuck fuck fuck let's just keep going straight wait only a right and left but we have two straights in a row keep going straight keep going straight can we batter into it or can we just fly straight through tary's got wings coming out of his head yeahlaura  left travis travis chaos chaos yeah i poop oh god oh yeah straight fly zig zag fly zig zag fuck yeah no it's a bat's ac oh dear lord yeah we did get pretty far wow eight oh can keyleth just-- wait what was your initiative order what was your number fuck as long as you just stay out of the way and don't break your concentration you can keep turning us in and out okay don't get hit tricky tricky if we can we're going to peace out we're all bats again i wink as a bat like i totally understand her well would she move she's got to wait until vax gets out of there now he's surrounded and he's a bat i want to lead everybody away down to the right but i've got to make sure that my brother gets away from these thugs before that happens so i'm going to hold my movement until-- can i-- i'm going to hold my dash action then until i see that he's safe or at least he's away from them so we can get going bats disengage okay i see him and we have everybody now i take off to the right yeah it was the last thing it was to the right was the final turn right i know why did he say it like that like it was-- but everything else was-- i'm going to the right that's the last intersection that i know toodles as much as we can be toodles who is that is that keyleth oh it is no but percy's off the map fucking balls this is not good planning solid everybody's far away from her except for me and-- who's the other person oh no did i disappear oh because i was in a corner that's okay that's pretty hot can you put a little marker on me so i can see it i can't see the erinyes okay thank you oh god oh my god if she dies we're fucked i'm up i run forward and i slide on my knees and put my hand on her and cast cure wounds at 4th level on keyleth 27 points that's my action yeah i'm going to pop trinket out as my bonus behind-- sure whatever yeah and that was my full movement and everything wasn't it bad news bears no not if you give it to somebody else do you have any spells like a bless or anything bring everything in to use so you can just (poosh) to them how did this happen how did we get here nice that's the first time you've helped another person right that's what i said yes kill it so we can run away oh he's still alive keyleth can you do a wall of stone yeah block it okay we should put dust of tracelessness down dust of tracelessness on the ground fanged smile do we have anything to freeze if we can freeze him in place maybe he's made of metal 24 can i run to the other doors that vax has been looking at huh the far one in the back yeah and i'll look for the symbol 23 and i'm looking for a fanged grin that totally could be a fanged grin okay the very back door yeah is it possible to bonus hide nothing to obscure the view okay then i'm going to use my bonus to pop trinket out i guess he was already out wasn't he because we were running that's a waste of bonus (laughs) no i'm going to hunter's mark so trinket was out i'm going to hunter's mark the guy what about symbols do you see anything but is it a fanged grin a fanged grin is usually cocked but it looks more-- (laughs) i turn into a bear don't fucking die keyleth if you can do it to everybody why not and grog can you transform anymore or are you spent sanctuary no oh because he failed does it break through the door get it grog ooh perfect because why not a million now we just have to plane shift is it done get to keyleth we have to be touching her does he and the minute you take damage you become visible again all right i'm going to run forward and try to get to-- i'm going to poof trinket in and run forward and try to get to keyleth yeah oh my god i'm so confused i feel very nostalgic for some reason as she's doing this this is very comfortable for me oh god am i on the ground again did you put me down okay i mean i'm not opposed but he's really going to just try to kill us before we can get out of here if we make a chain we can reach over to him yeah you heal yourself just heal your-fucking-self that's vax he can dash he's not raging tary and grog can hold hands in that position right he can reach tary and percy yeah so can he reach his hand out and have percy and tary okay oh yeah he's super tall can he reach farther because he's super tall please please please please just let him get there we've just got one teeny little gap here and whose turn is it that's me fill the hole oh not you holy shit holy crap that was a really fun episode that was a really fun game i feel like that was the most fun that we've had in a while i'm so tired good times
