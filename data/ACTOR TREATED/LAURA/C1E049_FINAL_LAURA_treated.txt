what if you kill him what if he dies while you're-- what happened there's always tomorrow darling tales from the borderlands the baftas already happened she didn't it's all happening that night longest night ever marisha and spectacular spectacular don't build it up too much now they'll be expecting it matt different characters we weren't our regular characters but equally fun i thought i played jester a tiefling cleric yeah you were a dwarf paladin i don't remember ooh hello oh these glorious boxes so wait this is a regular sentinel deck box this is another box this one has our logo etched into it it says how do you want to do this sweet crit role oh it's right in between it total dicks and all of that with just a stump no he had to show us where the orcs were did i cast pass without a trace on us before we headed out then i'll cast it again so that he's incorporated in it and i think we should try to stealth it hey hey wonderbrain i think it would be smart if we moved as quietly as possible you know keep a distance when you hear no more fighting it's probably safe probably what no don't-- i take it back and i give another dagger to him don't accidentally stab yourself because i think it sucks your life energy out of you yes it does it definitely sucks your life 25 oh it's not above 25 i think you are so right and i'll take that from you and in exchange i will give you this wonderful opal dagger that i have on my person still very sharp what what did he just tell you i wasn't paying attention he's lying he always lies don't pay any attention to him you're safe with that jesus and then as he walks away it poofs back into his fucking belt i don't see anything at all one off to the races (whispers) what is it hello salute running away use your words keyleth talk are they headed this way so i cast pass without a trace on us so should we stealth 29 what he's a dot i do i like it can i search the ground and see if there are a lot of tracks around or is this like a roaming party i think we should take them out before they get back to their group we're supposed to slay them and stop them from-- but what if we kill them now we won't have to fight them-- but i can follow tracks fine fuck it (whispers) oh they're definitely bad oh my god look at that camp where are the wine barrels so next to the tents that the prisoners are being kept in what time of day is it well i'm a little hurt i think it would be good to create a distraction we go in save the prisoners and then take out the camp and then we can stealth down-- okay and then once everyone's clear we bring them back and kill them all or what and find out how do we get all the prisoners out very quickly scanlan could you potentially put all the people in the door i'm saying get the prisoners safe so that nobody's running blindly into the forest what if you spent some time a minute creating your mansion you have a little door here once you've created a distraction we can all run up and put them in the door and then we fight and then we get the people out of the mansion not near the bears okay liam and all right so we sneak around to the back we'll make the door far enough away do it make the door make the door behind one of those trees get ready to do a distraction right fucking now no i'm staying on the other side charge in after the distraction oh pike did come we said pike could stay because she's not stealthy and then run the other direction yeah that's good that's good yeah that's little creatures seriously like a giant scorpion would be probably pretty cool fairies they are oh my god then probably don't it's true 16 yeah that's so sneaky do we also hear a little dryad voice i'm going to run forward well actually i'm going to stay hidden okay i'm going to-- i know i know i know can i stealth forward okay good then i stealth forward towards the camp towards the tent away staying away from people yeah is that as far as i can go in towards the tent then i'm going to stealthily-- i'll be able to get to it on my next turn to the tent okay then i'll shoot one of the guys that-- yeah that's really hard to hold steady yeah i'm going to shoot him yeah 18 on the first and 30 on the second okay 15 16 17 and that's sneak attack five is 22 second attack is five seven 13 no 14 12 i can add 13 14 oh no i don't get sneak attack on the second 14 on the second attack i use my bonus action to hide 36 oh pike but she's really strong now with the guiding bolt yeah are those the ones i gave you get them out you should roll in your box oh no oh me i thought travis was after-- oh every time oh okay i want to shoot trinket out into a cannonball from-- okay i'm going to move up to where i'm lined up with all of that row so this whole shebang right here yeah all of these guys and you too because you practiced it with him take out the thing and say trinket cannonball and shoot him out and try to roll into all those guys there right his move is 40 three attacks oh god really he gets advantage because he's awesome matt and he rolled pretty fricking bad 12 15 one matt and what is that cannonball exclamation point cannonball yeah you know what you sent it to me forever ago it's in my email somewhere matt can you tell me what magical beasts i can conjure while you're at it because-- 2d6 plus eight okay i suck 2d6 plus eight 12 on the first that's better 17 on the second yes good job trinket good job buddy 20 really dizzy though okay can i use my bonus though do i have a bonus action on top of that hide natural 20 oh no look at how teeny trinket is compared to the other bears you can do that man that's a good thing to have no no ha trinket's yawning soft earth yes what 12 that was a good turn yeah not unlike a raven taking flight no all right i'm going to turn trinket around he's going to attack that dude that got a hit on him the one behind him oh shit okay he runs up to the one on grog but he moves out of the way so that i can get a clean shot on him and he bites him and he claws him okay huh i still get a bonus action he gets to attack and i get to attack yeah he gets two attacks because of bestial fury gosh darn it that one's good okay he bites the shit out of him what is that 13 no 12 and then i'm going to shoot him from my hiding spot all right 20 great 16 plus sneak attack 19 while that was going on i wanted to run forward and work on the guy that fell from the tree i wasn't paying attention to that does he look like the description that we got you're stronger than pike again no-- wow are you survivors of westruun you're safe now as is your camp small older gnomish fellow so he stayed in the town what's your name darling vanessa you're very strong vanessa oh well thank you do you like bears not those scary ones but really nice ones trinket sits back he's friendly i go for that circlet that was on the war chief i inspect it first was it human bodies or animal bodies oh quite come on over the circlet no we do have some stuff in it all right yeah i'm keeping some boar meat i thought you were a vegetarian i like it i'll hop on the broom yeah can i stealth in the air can i wrap myself in like my-- i'm not that giant okay so i usually get advantage so i'll just roll regular oh oh you know what i still have pass without a trace because i never cast hunter's mark to break that concentration 23 i like it (cackles) i'm so scared of all my dice right now 17 oh wait favored terrain forest at the edge of the mountain okay 17 i don't think we should land on the ground we should just stay above you can't talk when you're a bird oh this is really smart you coming because we can't do anything do you want to pop out of that can you pop back in one caw for yes two caws for no you can't even understand me right now this is ridiculous i float down gracefully on the broom and give it a little bit of a closer look no no no i'm still in the air i'm not on the ground what do you think scanlan back up a little bit and shoot a flaming arrow into that sweet i back up a little far distance away and shoot a flaming arrow into it and it's not moving it's not fucking moving right now why are you trying to do this to me right now why you got to be a player hater well that looks deep i don't think we should check this out on our own you're a bird you could probably fly in and fly back out should've been a fucking owl i float up to the edge of the mouth of the cave and say (whispers) scanlan (whispers) are you alive what if that's his face i stay at the mouth of the cave and say (whispers) scanlan are you alive (whispers) scanlan wait scanlan is that you you were a crow okay that's you should we go we should go back one hoo for-- i start flying back you're exhausted and some boar how you doing there grog and i slap him across the face a few times yeah that's good they'll know how to get back yes will you and cyrus inform everyone else that it's safe for them-- oh shit we're not back they can't go there we'll be back and we're going to send you to whitestone where you'll be safe yeah yeah yeah of course it's yours darling you too you can keep the opal dagger i gave you scanlan did you see how generous i was just then what's wrong grog whispers about grog you've never had a whisper what no there's not wait so did we already tell everyone what we saw yeah blue light i keep an eye out for any enemies along the way i'm going to do that with advantage because i'm in the woods 25 let's go this way and then circle back so this is the place technically scanlan flew in so i don't think he had to check for traps does it look like water reflection can i investigate the walls did you already check for traps in this room wait start at the beginning can i get on the broom and fly up above the pool of water and look down into it 25 oh my gosh keyleth you're so smart keyleth use the thing to see magical runes really thought it was going to do something i really really did i watch it go down hey that's a good thing should we control it or-- at disadvantage it's going to be so bad oh god it's got to be water can i see them coming up what the hell happened what was down there yeah is it a fast drop or do we float down with that water nice go where i'll go next yes yes yes he's in my necklace can't move quickly oh swim up i catch myself on the broom and i fly and when they're not wet enough it could be four sphinxes how high is the ceiling yeah it's four sphinxes i'm flying so i'm up near it can i investigate it i'm not poking my head into it i want to get a closer look investigation or perception you said perception i just want to get a closer look at the circle 19 it said in the previous room the sky is a window does that pertain to this which we came through are there any runes on the gold around that circle on the ceiling is it the same language that was around the-- abyssal draconic elvish-- i grab the hunk of quall and i float it up to the ceiling i take the hunk up to the ceiling how did you make this work keyleth does that mean these are magic i can't remember what this thing does wind blows fire burns yeah i go over to one of the other pillars and blow on it the one under the air part how do we do earth oh shit i fly up into the hole in the ceiling-- i fly up into the hole i drop the endless rope down from the hole as i'm flying it up so there's a rope in the middle of the room so that everybody can go for i'm flying up-- yeah no it's on my cloak rope of infinite twine oh fuck all right fine i fly back down-- gimme gimme gimme the rope i tell him to hold on to one end as i fly up i let go the rope should be coming out of the robe no no no i'm trying to let the rope out as i'm flying up is there anything to tie rope off onto what about the doors are there handles shit keyleth do you have the immovable rod i fly down and i grab the immovable rod tie the rope onto it climb it climb it can i fly back down and grab scanlan well i go down and i grab pike then and i go up on the broom can i use pike's shield and try to direct it to where some of it isn't coming-- oh maybe pike should do it because she's way stronger than me she's got 19 strength now yeah i thought we were doing what we were supposed to do down there jeez it would've been better if we would've just gone up the hole a name is earned yes or his name now there's fire that was really smart grog does it cure exhaustion if he takes a short rest what was that second line knowledge dost billow-- i'm peeking through the door at this point i walk up next to him oh yeah i see what you're talking about yeah smart while he's doing that i want to use primeval awareness to sense celestials that's not a spell slot it's just my-- oh expend one ranger spell slot i have never ever done that i have never even looked at that bold-- wow i am sorry about that matt can we see all the way to the end 16 those doorways is it far away you can set my arrow on fire and send it down oh just don't want to walk down there let's get in the doorway and then if something happens we shut the doors if you want to walk in oh my gosh hold your breath as you pass the wispy wisps i don't trust them just open with a brazier at the end i'll take the middle maybe you should do that oh my god his name what is his name jeez louise any ideas 19 that map is awesome oh do i feel old oh jeez i shout out-- i run towards the other water portal and i shout out pike do you know the names of the four ancient gods is your name four that's stupid yeah i wouldn't have any religion anything to base that off of wow wow two that's four ones in a night i've been cursed i have an advantage on anything having to do with dragons well i was just checking i saw percy dip his hand into the water so i do the same thing to see what it does i put my hand in the water does it hurt pull it back out can i use a bonus action to try to hide is there anywhere to hide maybe against a wall or something i feel like we're so stupid we should know this the four endure the four remember 24 24 obelisks were in elvish down to 79 strength we're all going to die why 30 30 ah c'mon that hits me you go ahead and suffer say it in celestial percy maybe that's his name power the sky the sky 23 22 that's a lie 22 wait but i still rolled a 22 i take back my glare can i look up at the ceilings and see if there's any portals on the top of the ceiling like there were in the last room 29 is there anything to tie the robe of infinite twine onto do i still have the immovable rod from before okay then i put the immovable rod i tie it in i hold on to the rope and i jump in the water yeah i pull myself back out oh my god k-a other door but make sure there's a rope jump in the water make sure you can get out the little brazier that i'm next to but don't jump in without a rope yeah make sure you can get out okay so many whispers maybe i don't know how long is his name oh you're right j-i kaiju i don't know hey we're on twitter you guys @criticalrole oh no grog can't read (laughter) it's like a-- there's a circle (grog voice) also ale was that o-i grog what if it hits pike pike plus 2d6 necrotic that's the saddest thing ever grog what did you see i guess i-- jesus can i bring trinket out that's stupid if i well i'm going to go and try to see what's going on over there with the sphinx can i see grog can i run forward and cast cure wounds on pike she's got a fucking sword in her can i help her i mean does she still have a sword through her can i pull her off of it and then cast it i know i-- oh natural 20 it reminds me of what happened to pike before grog snap out of it and i cast cure wounds on pike's stomach level three three 17 six so hard to get these last two fucking letters the first one was 15 wow but as a half-elf you have a longer life so really at age 50 you're not that far in but your rage ended natural 20 it's planted next to the water but my rope is attached to it and it's dangling next to me i dropped it when i healed pike so it's right next to me i pulled the robe over to there 19 i know it was really close of course 28 points maljikaori maljikairi kaorimal the order was fire earth water air that was the circle so it could be in any of those orders maybe yeah i'm unconscious six hey it's better than zero thank you i'm alive (laughs) oh no this aging thing is it permanent forever nine we're seriously going to die i look at vax and laugh at him because he's so much older than i am you too secret doors obviously oh thank you i know i'm like there's going to be a test later that got so much more intense than i ever thought it was going to yeah i thought we'd go and talk to this guy do we need to go after all of them
