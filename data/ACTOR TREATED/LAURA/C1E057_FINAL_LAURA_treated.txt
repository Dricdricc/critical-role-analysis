right what was i thinking of course grog come with me can i go find vanessa (sing-song) vanessa vox machina here-- oh hi oh well we were wondering if we could be of service to you we happen to have acquired a great many dragon bits and we thought you might be in need of buying them for your sellers-- buyers your people fence-- you know no fencing no no you're-- legal buyers black ancient black dragon oh white do we have any white bits left what do you want scales or that was the dragon we killed for you before because we didn't bring the-- no but we killed one with zahra we killed a white dragon we've killed four dragons four fucking dragons go us yes i think so of white dragon scales 5000 gold pieces i think is a fair price what if we gave you less dragon scales would you have said less money i think we'll keep them and we'll sell them to other vendors then vanessa you're so kind i'm so sorry thank you vanessa they were worth a lot more than what she was offering just for the record they are worth so much more well we've not really tried that doesn't mean we should just give them away it's not 64 pounds oh it was 64 pounds (groans) well they're worth like 20000 gold you don't care all right let's go find your queen what do you have in there are they still good we could make stink-bombs with it marisha and we go see the raven queen you go see the raven queen and we

(laughs) ohhh (laughs sarcastically) (gasps) i've been slowly heating water and giving it to vax to put in his bath i don't wash him i just give him the fucking water do i see any of the blood passive perception 32 i also spend a lot of time that night reading but i'm reading the book about the raven queen pretty much have it memorized at this point oh there's a loot crate giveaway it's so sick also give your friend a hug love each other don't tease me about the feywild is one of the vestiges there which one it's a cloak that devours magic and there's a really beautiful strong bow in the feywild yeah to the dread emperor's you can banish us to the dread emperor's island to the feywild so we don't even have to find an entrance is it somewhere that you have to have been or can it be somewhere that we have been syngorn is in the feywild they transferred the entire city there it's a whole other plane would we have learned something about it in syngorn it sounds awful no it says it's offline okay yay and we got the warden thing yeah that was the best you know because the more i think about it i mean we almost just died many times and the last time we tried to get a vestige it almost killed us and maybe we just need a little bit more preparation maybe make sure whitestone is actually preparing something underground just like westruun exactly but there's a spinning orb of death there oh okay bless you are they like mermaids (gasps) in your roving pirate days wait could i see the list of vestiges whisper (sing-song) the shrew have you heard about an island of glass yeah near an island of glass (laughs) i was waiting for it to-- come around yep it's a good plan grog you could really do something terrible to him with that thing i think you're probably right but let's make sure that whitestone is safe before we do such a thing we don't need an airship we have an instant ability to transport anywhere that will be the first thing we do when thordak dies is we jump on an airship all the fun has gone out of it we're going to whitestone (laughs) you're stuck in the tree are there any leaves on the sun tree yet whatever a wolf i just want to go find zahra and give her a hug and say hello and see how she's doing while he's talking dear the dragon arrow you gave me killed him well i didn't kill him actually with it but i did a lot of damage umbrasyl dead one down where's cashew i know his name is fucking kashaw so he's not there i do know broody types what are you reading i'm sure you have ideas i sit down next to her and ask just catching up and see if they've spotted any dragons zahra how long did it take you to make that arrow if i were to give you some more money do you think you could do it again i'll talk to percy but i'm sure if it's for a good cause all right i'll come find you dear that's his first name shaun how did you know that i fucking know i remember we taking a trip yeah (laughs) ashley and you look so healthy gilmore oh that we are oh (giggles) you're strong enough to-- be careful of your wound gilmore the orb they get sucked in grog we have some delicious and very expensive wine expensive-ass wine we could bust out with dinner oh i haven't got to wink in a really long time you guys it felt so good definitely dear (laughs) while we're getting ready i would like to talk to pike about a certain proposal that happened none of us have addressed it what happened what did you tell him did you tell him yes did you tell him no we'll circle back (laughing) how did he take that how do you feel about him pike he is very charming even more charming like every once in a while i look at him and i go no but he's small but at the same time i'm kind of interested you feel like-- yeah but if you're actually interested then it's not gross at all wait we don't want to push you pike but you know it's just us girls here all right you pray to your sarenrae about it you look beautiful i tug up my dress of course can you breathe all right aw matt i give her a hug how's kima we haven't seen her yet you don't have to wear a dress kima (chuckles) would it be in this plane or another you haven't put any blood through it though no i'm hoping that hasn't happened was it sucking you in gilmore-- any of you allura-- have you experienced any kind of draw toward the orb do you feel different having been around it for very long well i don't know i mean it is a very strong relic that we don't know how it works up close and personal don't dragons sort of see past those things we-who-must-not-be-named (gasps) i love it yes yes the warden the wrath of the fey warden just the name yeah yeah yeah out of the cancerous tree and fen-wraths what's the name fenthras is inside of the tree that is terrible did you happen to find in your research what perhaps we might face in the feywild i mean we've learned a little bit of it but i know that it's going to be rather dangerous (laughs) (laughs) oh yes good thing we didn't provoke them in the cave at all percival yeah why am i writing this down i know this shit (whispering) interesting (muffled) oh fuck (gasps) you think there's something bigger than thordak in the fire plane could he still potentially have it inside of him all right which one oh kord i got it (chuckles) oh fuck because he's a dick i'm confused take over everything well that's good maybe they won't take vengeance maybe the white one will want to help kill thordak with us no does the heart-stone make him even stronger than he already was shit if we can pry it out of his body we could shrink him down perfect plan we can go in another dragon doing what just flying wow so good this wine is pretty good you've done so much you should have been with us sorry kima we're dicks it's better it's getting better oh yes we will (laughs) we could go get me a new bow there's also the ocean no you're crazy or the two of you together birkenstalks i like it i want to make a once-over on vax and make

blood behind your ear (sighs) sure are you going to tell me why you went and saw the raven queen (whispering) dear-- we all need sleep sometimes hon is this for you or for my brother i give percy a kiss on the cheek it's exciting (laughs) i think it suits you i won't tell anyone percy your business is yours and mine because i noticed (chuckles) (quietly) we're all family oh percy sorry if zahra wanted to make some dragon arrows could she use stuff here in the castle yes all right sachet what does it do are you still here you should go to bed in the dining hall what i know always (chuckles)

rakshasa oh my god oh my god oh my god why does it always leave off when he's about to get killed because you do that's the thing (laugh) oh so what did you do what did you do and you said something
