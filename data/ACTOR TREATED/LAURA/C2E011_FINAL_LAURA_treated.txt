have a whole infrastructure of people supporting him and then they would come after us yeah i mean we could hang out in the lobby in this bar and i could watch every person that comes inside i could draw their picture and know every single patron that's in here so that we have something to turn into the guards when we rat everybody out just be distracting we're good at that we will hang out up here and just be weird oh yeah i have the tusk love too i read it and i keep looking at fjord like-- and then go back and read it i assume it's about some sort of orc love what's the name of the

richter very high middle if not low upper like a warm pink center yes oh yes how about we have a trading company how about some of our wares got stolen on the road on the way to zadash by a group of bandits i have a forgery kit you guys we could change the name of the baumbauchs to something else what if we say we're from the timalt company they never paid our invoice and they stole our puppies that's how we would know that it was a bad guy okay yes and it is very sad to get all of us through who all can make disguises for themselves you can cover up your face at least why blessing of the trickster advantage no we don't have to it's not locked i try to break the gate i try to pull the gate i'm trying to pull it open oh 17 go go go keep going oh yeah avoid all the rat balloons you still
