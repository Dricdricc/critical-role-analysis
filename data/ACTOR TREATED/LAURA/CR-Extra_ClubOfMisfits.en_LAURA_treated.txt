something tonight's episode of critical role [magical music] they're sipping nutterbeer at the five brooms or buying sweets at the local goody shop it is it's really good all of the students and faculty except that is for you five no you five are in detention you've been asked to serve in the defense against the dark farts classroom as you file in early in the morning the first student to walk in is a dryffingor sam why don't you describe your character do it go for it sam no you're a dryffingor get it right jesus yes you're a student i sent you a thing sam technically you're a witch but whatever yes you do you walk in and you sit towards the front of the classroom like you normally do you're followed in immediately after by a slight gentleman rather small of frame brian why don't you tell us about your character (singing) and i like to do drawings all right and what house are you all right bryan you follow in behind claire you think about sitting next to her but you've always been uncomfortable around girls so you end up taking a seat in the row behind her off to the side following in behind bryan is an athletic built guy he seems really cool he's a smytherpin taliesin-- andy comes in and sits next to claire you guys are pretty familiar with each other being both popular students your mother spends a lot of time at schmogwarts all of you look to the back of the classroom as a commotion happens a very tall student disheveled he'd be handsome if he didn't look so scruffy maybe walks in he's knocked over a stack of books as he walks in to take his seat travis bunder comes in and stares all of you down as he takes a seat a couple rows behind claire and andy all of you stare at each other in silence until a young horfleporf walks into the classroom she's got scarves all around her face her hair is all disheveled and it's odd because instead of walking behind you she walks all the way in front of your desks around the classroom before filing in and taking a seat behind you bryan tell us about yourself liam no you probably shouldn't no don't share it yet don't share it yet as you stare at each other suddenly-- the door at the top of your defense class you know belonging to professor furbin slams open whatever she walks out upon the stoop and says well well well here we are i feel i must congratulate you all for being on time and to thank you for allowing me to spend my day here with you instead of celebrating a day off yes claire the time is approximately 706 that means you have exactly two hours and 54 minutes left to ponder why you're here-- -- to think about-- bunder would you like another detention you're familiar with this classroom well there you go next saturday you're here with me again it already is two do you want three three it is keep going four it is give me a full month bunder are you done quiet bryan there will be no speaking there will be no moving from your seats in fact i'm going to give you all an assignment she begins walking around passing out pieces of parchment and quills i want you all to write me an essay at least a thousand words telling me who you think you are when i say essay i mean essay don't just write the same word over and over and-- as she's speaking there is a small tap at the door oh for heaven's sake she walks to the black of the classroom-- the back of the classroom opens up the door you see her speaking to somebody in hushed tones one moment do not get up she steps out of the classroom and shuts the door the door opens back up professor-- what did i say furbin -- walks back in professor durbin durr walks back in i'm afraid there has been an emergency situation i have to leave the classroom for a few hopefully minutes you are not to leave this classroom finish your assignment do as you're told i have ways of knowing what is going on in here are we understood that is none of your business and you bryan will be here next saturday as well serving another detention if any of you leave this room you'll be serving with him as well two months two months detention for leaving this classroom are we understood quiet behave yourselves you are young adults and she leaves the classroom oh what do you do her office is at the top of the stairs the door's at the back of the classroom you have shelves along the walls with all of the books that you're used to yes it is there's cubbies you've been in this classroom for years though you know exactly where everything is shy of her office locks on the doors you can try which one the classroom door all right it seems like the school is used to students trying to fuck around with things and maybe it's not letting you do it roll a perception check all of you well you're busy making vines aren't you 15 okay claire and andy sitting closest to her office actually that makes sense both of you hear very faint almost sounds like a small child is it screaming maybe calling for help yeah it's not locked mm-mm it's not trapped yeah bunder you're actually really familiar with this room having served so many detentions a lot of them one-on-one with the professor so this is the office you're used to everything's where you were used to seeing it actually let me bring in a map oh here's your classroom all right so this is where you are claire and andy bryan-- i did bryan allison-- yeah totally not sharpie here's you bunder you're back here i can put you where you're at no but i'll use some of these figures over here like sam did okay so this is allison this is andy this looks like claire because you've got flippy hair oh this is perfect because this is a smytherpin this will be bunder then this one right here is-- well you're a girl we'll switch this this is ally this is bryan you have walked up here bunder andy you go join at the top of the door and you walk through there's actually no portraits on the wall here but what you're used to seeing in her room are three large tapestries covering the walls on the one on the back you see a giant tapestry like you're used to of a green dragon sleeping on top of a hoard of gold the way it's woven you can almost see curls of smoke coming up from his nose on the left wall is a phoenix rising from a big mound of ashes it looks like the fire is actually glowing in the weave on the right wall you see a tapestry featuring a herd of centaurs is that what you call them a group of them i don't know galloping over a hill with tall blades of grass almost blowing in the breeze it seems to move as you look at it what you're not used to seeing however is in the corner a little-- it almost looks like a birdcage filled with little sprites pixies you're not sure (gasp) you heard me you heard me help please you have to let us out of here i don't even know what she's doing the professor yeah she's obsessed she stole us from our home in the forest behind the castle please we just want to get back to our families it looks like about eight of them are you walking into the room as you walk in closer you can see better now that instead of a normal fairy they almost look like there are two arms on top two arms on bottom and each of the fairies have eight-- four legs that's how it would go four arms and four legs they have humanoid features but closer it's almost like a tarantula they've got a fur covering their bodies they're pretty small you can't really see they're almost a black color beautiful wings dragonfly-like wings they are but they're sitting they're not flying in there right now they're sitting very sadly i'm going to take my necklace off because it's hitting things please why are you laughing you have to help us yes by this woman this small woman please we were brought here the professor says she wants to learn about us i don't know what that means there's a neat stack of books on the desk everything else-- she's a very clean professor there's no beverages no nothing they took one of our friends i haven't seen her since no i don't know it's hard to tell time in here please i haven't but i miss my family so much please if you let us out i can tell you how to open her desk the desk the cage has a small lock on it yes i know where the key is it's in the drawer on the left-hand side of her desk okay you look at the desk there's three drawers in the left-hand side and the middle is more intricate-looking it looks like the middle drawer is the one that's locked that she was talking about but you can open the left drawer if you want to okay you open it sitting in there you see a small key that looks like it would fit in the birdcage as you open it the fucking sprites go fucking crazy they just come out into the room i want everybody to roll initiative let me find my little dice because i don't have actual sprites but i have these little dice that i'm going to use to show where they are itty-bitty dice how many do i have how many did i say one two three four five six seven then we'll use this teeny-- oh they're so teeny so they fly out one goes over here one comes over to the corner one comes up on the desk two fly out the window out the door one flies over to-- who is this one liam and

bonus action oh that's right you're a sorcerer ain't nobody got time for that andy 22 hits that means you would have killed that first one just obliterated it's just splattered across your desk leaving a nice messy smear okay oh wow what it's those smytherpin dice you're using again you knock her down and splatter on allison's shoes back up to the top ally what do you do ooh both of those you walk over here and you're aiming this way i'm going to roll for both of them neither one succeed they're both slammed up against the tapestry this one impales itself on the other one's dagger and they both start sliding down the wall now it is the sprites' turn the one in the corner with you bryan she's going to try and bite you again that's a 15 plus-- yeah that definitely hits make a constitution saving throw brian and 12 it hits (laughter) okay good all right the one next to you claire-- she's going to grab onto your hair and start pulling it to try to dagger-dagger your ear the first one she gets tangled up in the hair it misses the second one definitely hits and the third one again she gets caught in your earrings that's four points of piercing damage to your ear hole yeah the one over at the bookcase continues to stay over at the bookcase and starts shredding books laughing the whole time oh yeah this is a little bookcase over here that's what this is tearing up the books pieces of book go flying everywhere claire-- no bryan what do you do whoa all right yes you do roll for a spell attack that definitely hits did you cast it at level one oh yeah that little fairy is smushed amongst the plant in addition you also flattened the fungus that was attacking you in the corner wow claire you're up you did one missile at the one on your face and two at the one it doubles okay nice no they're both still alive (laughter) okay bunder you're up everything in this room has been splattered so all that's left is claire screaming like a-- don't you-- yeah use your wands wizards that is completely wiped out andy you're up there's one sprite left but you can't see it yeah you can well you can't see the sprite but you can see fucking mayhem over here you can come down like that it's what yeah it's ripping up pages wow okay and try to smash it oh i've got to roll oh natural one andy kicking butt on these little strikes what a jock what an athlete he is the book smashes up against the wall the sprite gory on the other side of it slides down in the aftermath you realize you've kind of destroyed her office in addition to the classroom of course you can the centaur one gorgeous it was really nice tapestries yeah they do so allison you come over here you go rifling through the desk let me see what you find nothing really of use but you do find a lot of drawings of centaurs you see a drawing of a spider creature which is interestingly enough -- nobody noticed -- it's similar to a little spider that's sitting next to her desk under a little bell jar a glass bell jar yeah it seems like it not moving a lot but it's there she's also drawn pictures of horses with wings on them skeletal wings yeah that's all you find in those drawers okay roll an investigation check 15 you feel around the back it seems like somebody's stuck a piece of gum under one of the drawers you keep searching oh that is so gross you can feel maybe like a little bit of a lump something sticking out just a bit on the second drawer you press it and the drawer opens up in the middle all right on the inside you find just one sheet of paper and it's a letter from headmistress mcloglilagh mcloglilagh letting professor furbin know that she cannot accept her request to become the professor for care of magical screechers (laughter) saying that they have a really wonderful care instructor already but should the position ever become available that she will definitely let her know you see little splotches of water on it like she may have been crying over this no that was the main drawer she was protecting that poor sad little letter okay roll an investigation check no there's a classroom door there's-- there's no secret-- i mean you can look but-- five you don't find anything behind the tapestries nice your makeup looks really good now nice oh i like it roll a perception check ten you put your ear against the door and you can hear what sounds maybe like whispers on the other side it's very subtle you can't tell you can try opening the door to find out (laughter) roll an investigation check aw alas nein you do not find anything you can try the door it's unlocked you see a pretty dark hallway the school is shut down for the weekend but-- normally when you exit the classroom which is down one hallway -- so your class is at a diagonal and a corner -- to the right is a hallway that you know leads up into the further west wings to the left is a hallway that leads to the main stairwell that will take you down to the main entrance the great hall everything like that nice so you going stealthy everybody roll a stealth check plus ten yes whoa whoa whoa geez louise well you know what everybody else rolled really well okay which way do you guys head towards the left or the right you heard the whispers over to the right to the left is the big stairwell you know it well the stairs move they'll take you to every level but also to the main hall okay as you walk by you see what the whispers are and they're the paintings on the wall oh oh oh oh you see a painting of a jolly-looking man sitting he's been looking very frightened actually frazzled oh students students do you know what's happening (grumbles) pff it's coming from down below did you hear it the professor came out running the painting next to him chimes in yes yes yes she seemed very frazzled she seemed very scared indeed she ran below mmhmm can you tell us what's happening we saw her talking to somebody but we couldn't see who it was well you're of no use are you tell you what children will you go find out what's going on it's very dreary up here on the wall travis and remember everything tell me a story won't you oh yes the man chimes in next to her please tell us a story (laughter) towards the stairs-- you're not going to heal oh god really as you head down the hallway you see on your right hand side there's a door that leads to your level one spells class that your took years ago your first year at school you all know it well then straight ahead is the moving staircases yes no it's actually open it's a dark classroom you can hear a little shuffling inside of it actually the room lights up and in the corner you see a little house elf ah oh students beetle is very sorry beetle didn't mean to be out here for you to see her ooh please don't hurt me there's a bit of a commotion on the lower levels beetle is very sorry for it beetle hopes it didn't disturb you well hmm beetle wants to tell you but-- beetle starts hitting her head against the wall i just-- travis taliesin and schmogwarts is my master yes can't you tell she's wearing clothes she's wearing a very nice little-- yes she's wearing a frock with a schmogwarts logo on it actually pretty student makes a very good point beetle wants to tell you beetle needs help hmm no beetle needs help down below that sounded really dirty (laughter) please meet me next to the great hall she apparates out of the room this was level one spells there's nothing there's just empty desks and a board at the front of the classroom listing spells that you all know like light you make your way out into the very tall pillar where you see a bunch of staircases moving you know that one of them will take you down and as you start to get on it it starts shifting slowly over like it's going to another entrance do you run down the stairs all of you run and make an acrobatics check nice nice the three of you run you make a flying leap and you make it across easy peasy no sweat what did you roll ooh bunder-- and andy very surprising as such an athlete as you run forward both of you leap at the same time and actually run into each other and as you leap you barely catch the edge of the archway all right all five of you safely across you start making your way down to the great hall you enter-- it's very dark as you're walking down the stairs you can see a raggedy looking cat crossing your path she's looking around with red eyes she crosses your path everybody make a stealth check all right as you walk-- as you walk down you spot mr borris who you know is the cat belonging to mrs blinch yeah the caretaker of the school they will definitely report you if you're seen out of the classroom so it's very good that you all rolled very high you squat down and are very quiet as mr borris pads out of the room and across the way and enters the great hall you very quietly make your way down the giant staircase into the entryway and look around poof beetle beetle sees you thank you for meeting me in here no into a broom closet next to the great hall all of you pile in it's a very tight little room thank you for joining me i need help down below beetle needs help in the kitchens hmm no follow me beetle apparates out of the room make an investigation check your hair is in your face how do you see anything yes all of you can look around this broom closet oh well no need claire sees all as you all cram into this broom closet and start feeling around-- claire you realize there's actually a very small doorway at the back of the broom closet it must have been what she was talking about do you enter yeah if you crouch down if you crawl you probably could fit all right all right marching order is what no you're not okay claire the armor then bryan then who okay all right as you guys make your way down this little winding stairwell we're going to take a break all right we'll be back in a little bit i guess oh no all right and we're back the club o' misfits heading down the spiral staircase to beetle's lower levels yeah did i just-- oh i did i knocked all you guys over that's fine because as you guys come down the stairs nothing happens you walk out it's fine you walk into a giant kitchen it is a giant kitchen in the same shape as the great hall it is humungous there's lengths of tables like your house tables all the way down to the front but instead of seeing your stage where your professors normally stand you see lots of stovetops and cook prep you have hearths on either side three each where they're cooking different types of stews and everything like that you see a lot of house elves around there's a ton of them busy working getting ready for when all the students come back from schmogsmeade they all scream they scatter they go running except for one beetle pops up hi sorry about the mess in here most students don't see this okay well i want you all to know-- beetle wants you all to know that your professor is occupied i've told her there's an emergency situation and she was needed over in the east wing so i sent her that direction okay um no ooh beetle starts hitting her head against the archway (sobbing) beetle is sorry for lying it was important if professor furbin knew that beetle had lied she would be beaten thank you very tall dark handsome student professor furbin has asked beetle to help her in the past professor furbin had beetle gather up sprites from the dark forest behind the castle yes professor furbin is very interested in magical creatures she loves them i guess beetle did gather up a spider as she asked yes perhaps you students saw this spider she said she liked them beetle didn't tell her where she gathered it from though maybe i can show you (hesitantly) yes students don't need to go to the dark forest beetle can show you please follow us follow follow all of a sudden i'm sméagol she walks down the length of the kitchens do you follow her okay in the middle of the frigging kitchens you see a giant fucking hole in the floor spiders weren't happy that beetle stole a child beetle is sorry spiders wanted it back mm-hmm please spiders are coming out of hole mrs furbin would be very angry headmistress would be very angry if she knew perhaps students can just kill the spiders not very big bigger than beetle but barely bigger than students you're going to go down the hole mmkay there's a giant hole in the ground and you can see a ramp it looks like maybe a pillar has fallen and it leads you in a nice ramp down the hole so you don't have to drop all right down there as you light up the hole you can see it's a very deep hole it goes down for probably about 60 70 feet it's dark at the bottom still make an acrobatics check okay you start sliding your feet start to catch on the stonework as you go and you actually stumble forward into a run but you do land on your feet at the bottom of it do the rest of you follow do you travel carefully or do you try to slide like this jackass i don't judge i'm a dm i don't judge hmm jack ass all right all right as all of you travel down this pillar carefully you land in this very large cavern as beetle said there are spider webs around you don't see any spiders though what you do see is behind you it looks like there's been a cave-in maybe there was a doorway behind you in the bottom of the cavern before and across the way you do see a small doorway opening but the main thing that you see-- why don't i just show you hold on travis and oh i knocked all of you over again here you are you landed all down here bloop i don't know what's happened to the last one of you you're apparently just dead bloop all right hold on i'll be right back it seems like you have landed upon a giant board of wizard's chess it seems like it's seen better days they're battle damaged some of the pawns are missing arms there's a knight that's missing a head across the way the king has been impaled through but it's standing there and you all are standing on the board can we just show how hideous schmagadriel is she is so ugly anyway (gasps dramatically) no there's nothing you land on the board yes you certainly try okay i do in conjunction when you cast prayer of healing i'm going to mark this so you know that it's a concentration spell beacon of hope oh yeah so 13 what's your dex of course not it seems perfectly safe down here amongst these giant spider webs make an investigation check-- or a perception check rather you can see there seems-- you saw something pull back when you landed on the other side of the board hiding behind the pillar over there this one that is standing upright this one is the only one that's fallen okay you stepped here all right-- the board moves the board moves to here yeah where do you guys want to be i'm just kidding all right no that's you which side this one i know it's cool right and andy which one this one all right okay yeah you did but i thought you only moved forward one okay all right i'll allow it all right as you do it fades into nothing and you take the spot it's his turn now and it's going to move to there the knight moves forward the pawn shifts out of the way as this knight slides forward and takes its spot he's very intimidating this knight on a horse it's you guys' turn yeah you can this pawn's going to move forward two spaces as this happens suddenly three spiders come out of the darkness one comes out from right here and they're walking towards the board liam and i know aren't they this one comes out from this pillar over here and this spider drops down from above over here it's your turn yeah sure roll for initiative 25 to 20 20-- 15 to ten taliesin and okay claire and andy what did you guys roll man clerics they always go last it's like a rule whose turn was it oh god okay this pawn moves forward at the same time that this spider-- rolls up and starts walking towards allison it can't move that far no i know but the spider-- no the pawn just moves back there's already somebody occupying that space you could do that all right do whatever you want do it oh my god okay oh no i do not succeed the spider does not succeed against the tidal wave so you took out the rook and the pawn okay hold on let me roll for them okay neither of them save on their dex either okay yeah travis and that one is knocked prone as well okay 23 to each of those okay did you want to try to move anybody on your side of the board oh that's right they haven't moved yet no they did oh god okay okay okay i did not because these two knocked over are out of the fight they can't get back up all right we've got the spiders' turns this spider is going to come up here and attack andy they're going to make a bite attack against you oh that is 15 to hit okay that's 2d8 damage whoa (adding) 15 points of piercing damage against you now you need to make a constitution saving throw all right you save against that so no worries now the other spider uses its turn to stand back up oh he's still alive he stands back up and he can get to about there no let's say he can't get you yet he's very waterlogged he's uncomfortable claire you're up to attack as a person person you have to use your boobs you remember that beetle did send you down here to kill the spiders specifically oh my god okay i know it's so great isn't it okay so all of them need to roll okay wait i've got to say which one is which this one's for the spider that one definitely saves this is for the knight and the pawn they both fail okay okay minus 12 and minus 12 on the knights yeah they're still alive they're still standing yeah let's be honest next up is andy ooh okay he's still alive you want to move the rook up here it will because it's wizard chess the rook will move up and he'll attack the giant spider let me see the rook is shaped like a giant castle so it's weird to see pieces of brick come out and start flinging themselves at the giant spider but it's going to happen he makes an attack roll and he hits travis and whoa he does a lot of damage oh my gosh i don't even think i have this many (counting) what am i talking about i don't have this many i know i've got a whole bag but i didn't want to pull it all out because-- okay ha (mocking laughter) the rook does 28 points of damage to that spider smashing him off the board yeah get out you fucking spider now that that rook has moved this side of the board is going to take a turn and it's moving its knight up here and claiming your rook this knight smashes the rook to the ground all right next up is ally oh my god so that's all of this in here okay the king and queen they're making dex saves oh they both succeed that's 23 each you said they're risen up above jeez i wish i had something like that i'm going to put this here so that we know that they're above everything else crit role i'm going to use this wait no i'm going to make you this snakey thing there you go you're now a badger honey badger don't care who's turn is it this is exciting all right bryan well this is technically dildo baggins he's a knight you can move one of these hobbit pawns yeah you can't move two chess pieces at once oh you're right fuck you this guy's going to move hold your fucking horses this pawn is going to move right here all right now what do you want to do do you want to move pawn or yourself of you (counting) yes it is all right roll for attack oh yeah that definitely hits ten points of damage all right still standing i'll use this little beautiful spiritual weapon over here no because the bonus action is casting it yeah but you can do a melee attack-- yeah you can do a melee attack that's about it or a cantrip as an action oh it fails what did you do the first time okay it's still standing oh you were shooting at a spider i thought you were shooting at the pawn dude okay wait let me mark that off okay yeah he's still up now it is back to that spider's turn they're just hit so this spider is going to crawl-- actually it's going to turn around and attack this badger that just came at it from behind oh my god this-- give a shit hold on i've got to find the page this is so crazy ooh yeah that definitely hits that's a natural 17 so the son of aragorg is going to bite you he's going to bite you oh and he hits that's a natural 19 to hit yeah make a constitution saving throw a what you will take half damage as soon as i can find-- 17 halved so eight points of piercing damage then as a bonus action the son of aragorg is going to call forth his spider minions travis and he calls forth three swarms of regular old spiders but they come from back here they come from over here and then another swarm comes from over this way now it is bunder's turn nope he takes them out that's a genuine wizard's chess move okay glittery one is for the pawn oh pawn succeeds knight fails 14 points of damage let me add that up still alive yeah very much the pawn just took-- yeah the pawn is very much alive sam and now it's the chessboard's move the chessboard is going to try to attack you allison because you're right here with the pawn it's going to attack you oh my god there's so many pieces of paper here i know oh a natural one on the pawn yeah so the pawn feels broken so it steps right back here and the board's going to try to make a different move so the bishop here is going to move forward and try to attack-- so the bishop is going to attack for a 16 to hit all right the bishop is going to attack you with 2d10 oh double ones so that is eight points of damage it doesn't work so it moves back and it's going to try to take another move it's not taking the pieces so it's constantly trying to do the right thing it's going to move this pawn forward to here just kidding to here all right now it is the spiders' turn this spider is going to attack andy oh my gosh this spider doesn't succeed that's a two plus-- no that doesn't succeed now it is claire's turn what that does hit 13 points of damage with that the spider is crushed beneath the weight of your club andy the athlete once again succeeds can you do it that far away awesome all right and that you would also hit the pawn in front of you wouldn't you no it doesn't matter it's your teammate fuck it oh that's an 18 that saves is it a cantrip do you want to move it's your move in chess they attack diagonally i know it's pretty fucked up yeah god this is difficult well this one is going to try once again to take your piece that's sm�agol it's going to do-- oh god that's 2d10 plus six that's cocked 18 points of damage oh wait-- that was a crit wasn't it wait no because it's-- times two is 24 that's 30 point of damage oh no bunder's down liam travis and the bishop pushes you out of the way and the fallen body of bunder is now here no you're just sitting there oh i didn't roll initiative for those they'll just go with him okay it's ally's turn that definitely hits oh they don't even hit oh god okay badgers are tough though they're real tough horfleporf forever okay bryan it's your turn bunder taliesin and yeah yep so that's your move what's the casting time on prayer of healing totally okay it gets 16 so that's a save but you do have your spiritual still sitting out there which means-- mm-hmm you add your spell modifier your calculator glitches it just writes boobs upside down son of aragorg it's their turn the son is going to attack ally once more with a-- i guess it's very close so it's going to do a bite attack again oh that does not succeed they are going to use their bonus action to move their swarms in and this swarm of spiders is going to go (scratching) and comes towards you this swarm is going to over towards claire this swarm is going to go (scratching) and come towards ally those swarms they don't do a ton but they're going to do-- that's a five against-- nope that doesn't hit then the last one this is against ally that is a 12 they're going to cover you and try to bite you in your badger form all right so that's 4d4 here seven points of damage mm-hmm ah all right seven where did i put you ally i don't remember oh you're over here bloop ally's back all right it is bunder's turn oh no bunder the spiders are dead their turn is gone it's claire's turn don't you have higher level spells this is a pretty big battle this is a one-shot it's not going to go-- okay okay okay all right that's total okay all right minus 40-- all right 45 points down good job we're at andy no the chess board has not moved no you haven't taken your turn yet all right it's andy's turn up high all right okay the king succeeds the queen fails oh the queen knocked prone which means she is wiped off the board got it very nice it is the board's turn to move this piece is going to come over here that's a dumb move but it's doing it it's taking this pawn all right now it is ally's turn holy shit natural 19 all right the king looks a little hurt awesome bryan all right do you want to do anything else no spiritual weapon stays up so it's right there for your bonus action you can attack again all right roll for attack that doesn't hit that's okay your calculator is really cool looking all right up is the son he's going to attack ally once more all right that's a nine so 15 13 points of damage against ally and make a constitution saving throw oh you succeed all right bunder newly revived you are up oh big fail the king burns up and falls to its side all of the pieces on the chess board kneel down and bow to you there's no moves i like it use your wands i like that all right claire the constitution saving throw oh for your lightning storm yeah it's good that you remembered which one this one so you were here ten 20 you can get up there yeah the swarm of spiders attacks you as you walk away from it but that's okay it's just a little swarm it's no big deal that's a ten to hit ooh okay holy shit oh natural 16 that's fine you don't need the pawn it doesn't fucking matter wait so seven points you said they have to make a save they fail swarm of spiders (scuttling) all right andy you're up you fly in and you attack him with your club taliesin the first one is a ten 21 hits 12 points of damage all right all right 16 hits he looks like he's hurting a bit bunder it is now your turn just kidding i was looking at spiders never mind it's ally's turn oh it's a fail whoa 16 points of damage oh my gosh let me do my math here all right it's looking pretty rough bryan oh my god yeah make an attack hit that's 5d10 yeah these spiders are just guts guts everywhere splattering up to these pawns in these-- all right we're back up to son of aragorg going to spin around here and attack andy since he did so much damage to him ooh yeah that's a natural 19 that's a bite attack that'll do 16 points of piercing damage and i need you to make a constitution saving throw ooh that is what you needed to hit so that means i hit you with poison damage ten points of poison damage for bonus action he's moving-- this is the last swarm of spiders (skittering) they're going to come over to claire and try to attack her again so they're going to bite at you natural one they can smell the amount of perfume that you're wearing and it does not attract them bunder you're up spider-der ooh it succeeds ooh yeah he is looking really rough here all right that was your bonus action what's your action claire what would you like to do claire out your mouth wow that does save with 15 probably won't matter three points of damage is enough how do you want to do this claire ugh guts just explode you're covered in red and purple and black guts ally it goes with your motif though it looks good with your outfit yeah all right yeah but it's not their turn andy it's a little swarm it's a swarm of spiders all right roll with disadvantage oh my god ridiculous yeah these spiders are just squished wow as you all stand there taking in-- make an attack roll now you just run up and you stand up and you put your paws on her shoulders and you look at each other face to face claire to badger eyes what would you like to do you can certainly try that's true
