something i noticed that we haven't announced is that the rings that we had forever ago the d20 spinner rings those things are in the store right now i don't know if we found a stockpile of them that we had missed but there are some in the store right now just so you know i know we just found some i guess because they're there there's a bunch of other stuff too t-shirts and stuff but the spinner ring is there for maybe five more seconds maybe i don't know that's so sexy ew we wake up all cuddled in a pile in our room a little cuddle pile you don't sleep with the daggers kiri you want to remove them we should have taught her that last night i would like so much of whatever you have please thank you ugh that's a long time to the stables we run for it and we get the table first this table is taken by the mighty nein but if you need anything there's other tables i like your ribbons you're not i've never seen anyone in a dragon mask before and this is a bird she she walks around she's kind of the best no probably not so much like that and the green mm weird that's crazy yeah well anyway what it is that you need with that though is it the people in the dragon masks that want it is it your underwear it's a soup bowl then insight check insight check a soup bowl used in rituals (tinkling) he's incredibly trustworthy and he worships like crazy because he's had them wrapped around his weenie like a full dragon well he's going to take us where we need to go she's kiri they need more sugar here gators giant ones cali did you hear any howling in the swamp because we heard there were howling monsters jester fancypants just the one one nostril you know what i appreciate that you're so accepting of everything febron trinkets are pretty great yasha i'll write up a release

the colored ink from my mom to make it really gory here you go you can sign this all right we have a deal welcome to the mighty nein lots of pocket bacon whoa it's creepy yeah kill all of it kill the fog kiri i have to live with this for the rest of my life oh shit kiri come back kiri matt marisha and you have to be careful there's lots of creatures around that could hurt you you know we should really give her like a sheath or something to put that knife away fjord he has lots of fire i will it's fine beau i'm going to carry kiri on my shoulders yeah so that she doesn't have to walk through the muck how does she know there's a j in your name really oh jeez louise it's just milk we should avoid those huh wow dang it i'm trying to get to my bag to help you but-- i can't bend whoa yes sacred flame dex save that was a dex check yes toll the dead damn it we should really avoid those in the future huh i would woo-hoo 13 (whispering) i hear something i hear a chime no like little wind chimes like we had at home yeah we used to hang them in our balconies it sounded like that febron is that where the thing is that we're going oh so it's not the safe house it's another building for sure we should find out what it is that's cool just in a tree oh that's creepy our wind chimes were made of wood does frumpkin see anything around like any living things do you want to hold my hand i try to hold caleb's hand lumpy frumpy it's really good that pile was definitely something sleeping what kind of bones like gator bones maybe though i bet it was a friendly person i'll tell you what let's go to the safe house and then we'll come back if we are not completely almost dead and see what we see there especially if there is no bowl in the safe house then we know some other place to look for it let's mark a tree oh we'll find our way back (singing) let's go to the safe house then wait hold on let me look at what i have i could cast pass without a trace on anyone within 30 feet of me oh so it would be super slow well maybe not then maybe when we go back to the creepy tree we can do that i open my journal and start drawing him as a balloon (shushing) hey there's a lake febron are there monsters in this lake okay (splashing) then i go back out i just wanted to see we just freeze maybe i shouldn't move forward i stay right where i am what is it maybe it's something nice what's happening yeah right no sound at all (loudly) what are you saying beau (loudly) maybe there's lots of them around too i will got it i am a fan of pie kiri we are keeping an eye on the troll the thing is what if something bad comes in front of us and then they trap us because he's just following us maybe he has friends ahead that he's waiting on it's a friend i could if i made myself look like a little teeny troll and they would want to be friends with me what if we ran rope between a couple trees and then we tripped it man trolls are so cool do you want me to do it fjord here you hold kiri then because i don't want her to get too close to it what are you doing why are you holding-- sam and is the troll just watching all of you go away should i try to pass without a trace you guys i guess i will be falling back because i'm going to talk to him i thought the thing was behind us okay i'm going to pull the last of my pastries which i'm sure are really fucking gross by now i'm going to invoke duplicity and i'm going to send my duplicate towards the troll it's skipping towards the trees looking like she's picking some vegetation i doubt there's flowers but whatever yeah whatever she can do i'm going to have her turn her back to the troll and act like she's digging around in the mud pretty close i'm going to have her take a couple of steps away from the tree she's going to step back towards the tree don't think it was friendly yeah i think we should stick to the safe house what do you guys think i'll keep the invoke duplicity the second me skipping through the swamp at a distance invoke duplicity lasts i think a minute yeah beau needs to stop looking out for things yeah i'll look 12 i think yeah it's right here it's at eye level with me ooh that's better that's a 23 ah (chuckling) that was a one for me i don't see it but i don't wander too far from everyone else because there's a troll out there you guys i find that last one 23 you haven't gone past these-- shh (quietly) they could be around hey you guys i could try this thing that i've been wanting to do for a while which is where i can talk to somebody that is not alive anymore yeah the traveler's teaching me all about it and i think i can do it he kind of is but he's really powerful and he's super cool he wears this really cool cloak and he's got an amazing voice actually hold on i pull out one of my pamphlets here if you want to learn more you just let me know yeah do you want me to try it it's instantaneous but i can talk to them for about ten minutes or so just one dead person that i cast it on it doesn't have to be fresh it could be really old which one looks friendlier i mean sure okay hi i'm nervous i've never done this before okay i'm going to hold my symbol of the traveler i'm going to be like okay i'm going to do this thing kiri be careful hey you dead person hey i would like if you would come to life again a little bit and tell us some things that we want to know (tongue waggling) (surprised yell) (screaming) well kind of (tongue waggling) we have to ask it some questions (low monotone) what did this to you really are you sure though have you ever talked to a dead person beau are you writing this down how many swamp fishmen many there're lots of them there're lots of them that attacked how long ago did this happen to you i get five of them wow two or three weeks ago oh did anything that you did to the fishmen seem to hurt them more than other things they bleed but there's too many bleeds i get one more question what should i ask don't kill it again okay kiri it's okay we have another question or we could ask it what its childhood was like don't waste all your spells you've got to fight fish men oh he's huge just stapled to the tree technically oh no 23 okay i'm going to toll the dead because he's been injured i'm going to turn around and be like (splat) it is necrotic damage but he has to roll a wisdom saving throw so 2d12 i can help search for those in a second-- six whole points he has a loud ringing in his ears damn it not flanked by febron i wonder if febron is going to get covered in that pus that's coming out of him the ring you're 40 feet within him please don't waste all your stuff on this guy because you know-- y'all don't get close to this guy because i don't want to waste all my-- i think it's okay because i'm going to have to use all my fucking spells healing you beau why don't you get back here 34 oh god please don't pick up beau no goddamn it --without killing beau because we can't attack it no but what if it makes it pus its thing and then it hits beau and she dies don't damage it do you have a healing potion can you just grapple it potentially 20 oh so close it's going to keep running away from you can i get within 60 feet of it awesome i'm going to cast healing word on beau as my bonus action healing word so you regain 1d4 plus four hit points seven points that was my bonus but i don't think i can do anything i guess i'll hold an attack i'll hold-- yeah i'll hold sacred flame until beau is dropped and far enough away maybe is she far enough away oh my god when she is far enough away i cast sacred flame okay so you get hit with 2d8 nine points we should just let him go huh travis and no you get disadvantage then get the fuck out of here can you try and hold on to the branch i don't think he's going down with it but we'd be idiots oh there's a dead person i'm talking to i turn around and run back to the dead person oh this isn't the safe house all right i guess that's what i'll ask it then because that's all i can ask sorry we got distracted there was a troll that came and stole our guide i think you might have known him anyway which way is the actual safe house that we're trying to get to oh shit we totally could have seen it well at least we know it's 100 feet so we can search for it do they have anything in their pockets investigation you say 14 i'm taking it are you going to check if it's magic okay i'm going to use mending on the note oh wait it doesn't make the words come back remember we already figured this part out shady grove i bet the shady grove i'm going to heal you mm-hmm my dead friend yeah i think it might be hidden or something aw probably hey cali can i ask you a question on check traps sorry this bowl that we're looking for you said it was used in rituals were you ever used in rituals with these bowls who were the bad people oh i know about re-- no i don't know anything about religion what kind of people they are super evil bowls i don't think being stuck inside makes you naive i mean i know some people that were stuck inside that know lots of things that's not okay i don't think the fish people like the safe house being here maybe this tree is sacred and it was being used as a safe house and that's not okay cali can you make this water around the tree go away oh no that's really impressive caleb can you do that too he can't do it nott should we try to go towards the tree towards all the dead bodies yeah huh damn yes are there any knots on the tree like underneath where the ribbon was it's right here 12 check for traps nott i'm going to move it then well you and beau and me did it aww right you can do light what if there's traps on the inside though cali you're so cool thank you i love you are there any trap doors on the floor that's where the fish people live are there fish scales on the ground 17 fish skin it's tough it's kind of salty smells like fish i'm going to put it in my bag i just open up the bag so you can see it we don't let cali see it sorry cali we should send a message to nott and see what she sees let's climb down that's not a long fall for a cat can we start tying a rope off upstairs and drop it down we've tied our ropes together and we're going to go down what else are we going to do why we can't leave kiri up there who knows what's up there we had it upstairs kiri (shushing) sit in this corner (shushing) no sit in the corner kiri right here don't move unless something chases you right she's down here with us right yeah let's kill the fish people yeah what if we all jump out at the same time and scream and attack at the same time like three two one we shouldn't do explosive because-- is this really the moment to talk about this oh jeez we're losing our ambush y'all ten oh no and then we jump out nobody nobody huh six i got ten oh shit no like behind that little-- he's dead he's dead too late sweet then they end their turn oh god that's what his spell is just within range until he's in range no remember you looked at this before but in the book it doesn't have darkvision we did this last-- damn beau's big okay i'm going to run over behind frumpkin in that little alcove actually that's a lie i'm going to go next to caleb yeah back a little bit even more then i am going to cast invoke duplicity i'm going to invoke duplicity she's going to run forward and stand next to fjord yeah because that's my action still pretty cool beau still pretty cool they're still inside the tentacles what are you at fjord it touched the ground that means it's cursed now hit one of its brothers i'll be able to fix him in a second that's great well not all terrible i'm going to send duplicity me towards fjord and she's in her illusion going to hug him and cast cure wounds i will call from a distance going don't worry fjord you'll be okay i'll cast it at level two so 11 points then i'm going to use my bonus action to cast spiritual weapon right over top of the other fish man in the back there 14 plus something so i think that hits so that is 1d8 plus four force damage so eight force damage do you get one more hit wait did you say it fell into the hole don't let it go into the hole let's get this guy out of the tunnel in case somebody comes through the tunnel i don't want anyone to see him right away me and yasha basically got it out you did it you killed them it's a light die it's not like a heavy one that wouldn't be affected by the magnet 210 silver you said okay we'll do some math do you see any diamonds do you see 300 gold worth of diamonds you said four sets of manacles really people don't like it when you do these things sam i wanted to look in the pools too they were coming from somewhere who knows there could be 20 of them on the other side of this we're supposed to secure the safehouse so anyway i feel like we should check and see if there's 20 of them on the other side of this thing yeah one person that can breathe really well fjord you are familiar with the sea can you hold your breath for a long time all right how about you go-- should we take a short rest again oh it's another hour oh you can only do it once a day you're low on health still aren't you i'm going to cast cure wounds on you if we're not going to take short rest if we're not going to take a short rest-- on the other side this makes me feel so uncomfortable oh my god are you okay what if the safehouse is that other tunnel what if this whole thing is the safehouse i'm okay with that i just can't believe we didn't find that bowl for you why don't you want me to come here please whatever (gasps) caleb you found the bowl i'm so proud of you yeah kiri's proud of you too what difference does it make you don't have it in your hand anymore caleb i don't think you should stop someone from talking to a god if they want to talk to a god i believe you cali i don't think i need to cast it on you oh well i can cast charm person not all of us are shitty cali be careful there's trolls out there and gators super-duper oh my god i will send all the letters cali that would make me so happy i'm going to write you letters back all the time okay hugs hugs hugs what jewels be careful okay yes of course
