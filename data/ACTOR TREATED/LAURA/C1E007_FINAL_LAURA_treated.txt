we're following her right and she said she would lead the way to the vault so fast no 22 (laughs) but they don't know where we are what floor are we on now right cool oh right so we could go back in the little storage room and go up let's go in the storage room and go up how dark is it in here is it like-- so potentially brother we could take them both out if you throw your knife and i do an arrow (gasps) maybe you can put yourself in a box and walk around why are you doing this everybody wait while my brother goes on a field trip oh i've been invited on the field trip guys just me who else can stealth do you wanna be something and pop in my pocket (laughs) that sounded wrong i should not go with you i can't stealth for shit right now (laughter) (whispers) scanlan my brother's calling for you what did he do that's 28 times two plus seven man you can't control kima can i sneak up to the corner at least so i can be ready to attack those two bastards i sit there and i kind of pet him as i look around the corner we should go after her 'cause we're all gonna split up let's all go in that back way and see if we can stealth around oh it was 17 oh gosh i thought he just got what i got crap what do i add to it okay hold on hold on oh good liam and i kinda clamp my hand over his mouth and tell him to shush oh crap i turn around and notch my arrow for them 17 same target he's right in front that one hits too that's 19 22 with the two arrows nine and 13 torture weapons go listen-- aw she's still going that direction she's-- you know what i bet she's pretty noisy too i need that one oh my goodness no (laughter) oh gross yeah that would be good all i want to do is find the damn treasure room oh they're up and looking for us oh no (whispers) get the sparkly thing can i ask him i'm asking you what you see in there what do you see in there is it sparkly where are they the stairs are up in the storage room man that's where we just were i mean i'm so far away i can try to get up there but-- okay i'll go around the back way then with trinket i like walk by the door and see that happening (laughter) i can't see anything can i from where i am can i hop on trinket's back and see if i can see higher i don't know i don't know no i don't have that 21 and 23 okay i hunter's mark him okay okay 13 uh 12 (laughs) math stay in school oh good one it would've been so cool though just do it keyleth oh right what-what yeah sure i like shiny things we're all going it's a big happy room (singsong) it's a trap oh no we don't have light stupid stupid stupid can we stealth i mean i guess we're all kind of-- all of us oh crud oh oh oh oh no i don't get any advantage in this oh crud me and pike oh no what if he sucks our brains out oh my god he's gonna die nobody nine (grog voice) i would like to rage (laughter) did it distract him enough that we lost our thingy five what happened we need to get out of this room then grog can you always put down the dust of tracelessness and i think we should all go back-- we should go to the second floor i think what we should do-- everyone i think what we should do is make our way back to the initial storage room we were in and go up that stairway because that one's hidden it's by a hidden entrance people aren't gonna think about that one as much as main stairways there's a lot more you guys i think we should go find the vault on the second floor i think i should gather the group and try to make it back to the other storage room just to get us out of this area specifically is that cool use your earring do you guys have earrings okay i come over there and see what the-- what just happened is the poison still in the air or is it-- so i can see that guy so should i notch an arrow and try to hit him all right i attack him then shabang oh dang it i didn't do it i meant to hunter's mark him and transfer it over but that's okay i didn't say it that's 30 for the first i did say shabang and 16 for the second well sort of 15 and eight trinket oh no i used two attacks dang it no no no i'm gonna hold him there 'cause he's already in the room what's happening with that dude i-- are you doing all this while i just pin down-- speak fast before i kill you can we all-- we go in the room and trinket goes up next to him and like gets all up in his face 15 oh i should've been so smart but i wasn't (laughter) okay oh man what did i get seven oh no that's okay is this like a turn thing or can i do something i mean can i quickly cast protection from poison on trinket okay i do that and that cures it yes it does yay trinket that is threatening we've got to kill this guy or talk to him at least yes are there any-- taking that in-- any healing potions or anything in here that we could use is this still considered the underdark oh cool oh that's considered the-- aw i could have been rolling twice for all these damn things (sings) 25 did i find any potions did i find anything what is that that's major oh good can we go to the bathroom before we do that it's less than-- probably less than 15 of each size less than that probably it was a small amount and that includes the shipping that's why the price is-- a very similar design so yeah no they're not second run yeah just hashtag them critical role and we'll-- oh but if you're selling them already there's somebody that's making really cool t-shirts on redbubble but if you're making them there like we can't print them too so like just submit them to us and then we can-- well he's well as far as health goes-- there's-- i mean there's the front entrance there's that door over there there's like two other stairways but we should use this back one by the back entrance so we should potentially just leave this castle for now and go find k'varn rest up-- i get it okay yeah right then let's-- we gotta go upstairs have some ale before we go out grog this could potentially kill us all scanlan had a great idea though should we talk about what scanlan wants to do -- all of us piled on grog and trinket and you as the bases and we become this-- i like it that's true 'cause i've got range so that makes sense no it could be poison though tell it to us tiberius what's the idea mostly except for the mind flayers and another big monster probably they might have-- oh no that's k'varn no no no he's at the other one oh or into that other thingie oh that's going to be so cool i think we should just go up the same staircase there's too many of them if we split up we could just all die if he's the god we just go in behind him as the god potentially all of us will be stealthed except for tiberius and you who is a scorpion and you who's riding behind tiberius no no no stick together too big of a group of an army upstairs to split us up that's not going to be us the secret one the one by-- in the storage room oh no grog fell over oh my gosh check for traps oh so we stealth down the other hall we try well well stealthing down that hallway can we check for traps check for traps i look i'm perceiving oh i get twice that good oh good that was way better ten yay but that's noisy they'll come out i think it's gonna be noisy it's not a stealthy attack the two of us get back by the other twin door and get ready to bust into that entrance grog don't do that not that far grog come back because if they see him-- yeah you bust in and be a god when you give it we'll go in the other way no she already did it it's three times louder than it normally would be yeah there's a lot of them (grog voice) i would like to rage those thingies yeah we're going to try to stealth in and sneak attack them oh god oh god i go in and stand at the walls next to the door 32 oh great 19 unless we're all dead next week in which case-- what color was the vial that's me i cast hunter's mark actually i just transfer it because the other one died i transfer it to the king and then i cast-- first i want to move trinket over and-- oh no i can only move trinket okay first i'm gonna cast conjure barrage it's a 60-foot cone so i want to see how many of them i can get can i angle it so i don't hit my buddies all right i'll hit them i roll 3d8 that was on a corner oh good 17 they roll a dexterity saving throw half as much yeah the total was 17 plus a hunter's mark four dc what do you mean yes it's 14 oh i did get a-- i didn't add my spell attack bonus should i have done that okay cool i'm sorry grog oh i move trinket in and i want to-- if i can get him to illithid i want to get trinket close like kind of behind the queen no no i want to get him near that way he can flank all right wait you're all the way over there 16 your turns are taking so long oh no tiberius fell off 'cause of the basilisk basilisk blood we can fix it she's smart she's closing her eyes oh no computer-generated you get 1d8 are you unconscious oh that's me every time no you're not okay i'm gonna hail i'm gonna-- hail of arr-- no yeah hail of thorns at level three at the queen and the illithid so i should've transferred my bonus action over to-- but i didn't that's okay that gives me-- i should've done this before i'm an asshole i'm sorry that gives me 2d10 yes yes natural 20 (cheering) oh awesome yeah all of it doubles oh so 36-- to everything within five feet oh right yeah i should've hit the mind flayer with that arrow no it would've still hit grog okay they have to make a dexterity saving throw yes second arrow i'm gonna fire from my flaming bow i've got one shot on that left at her again and that's a 28 and that's nine plus a ten where's my ten there they are that's plus two 11 oh shit shit shit shit he's still at like really high health too the king oh no no he's under her control oh my god oh god we've got to get out that's a retreat see if you can get the curse out of grog because if we've got to retreat then-- yeah get the king you may be able to kill him he's on his last legs probably you can attack him with your sword do it anyway he's at his last legs it would be epic scanlan i call trinket back get him away from that lava i run past 'cause i can't-- can i see do i have an angle or is it being blocked by molten tornado can i run across behind it yeah is that magmous right now okay then well maybe i won't run in that direction i run in the other direction and down-- yeah so i can see okay first attack is (sings) 20 no 19 yes okay 14 second attack is-- second attack is (sings) 21 what's that 12 yeah 12 damage oh um hunter's mark damn it bonus action we've got to get out yeah we all run out that-- grog has the magic carpet grog had everything oh wait no wait didn't clarota take kima oh so we're all fucking fine let's just get out do i get to roll twice 'cause of terrain 29 hot hot hot hot hot oh right is the thing not-- wasn't there-- she also had created a wall barrier can you cast it again oh no 29 i send trinket up to like pull him anticipation oh my god ew get that away from me that went so long i'm sorry guys i encourage massages no
