what no oh my dice where are my dice i'm so nervous i don't even have my dice oh my god are they in there what who goes up what next oh i think it's me i'm a really good giver of advice i learned that about myself no i really feel like i'm going to throw up (retching noise) i threw up so many dice you should check out his twitter page because he has printed out flat mercer and he's chronicling his adventures and i'm pretty proud of it there's some guinness in the fridge e3's next week oh wait no it's not it's two weeks from now it's two weeks from now i'm sorry i've always thought that about you taliesin no you're not just straight into it oh jeez he's trying to puke you up it's in his butt it's a strength saving thing so-- back when we first made these characters i remember you saying that really you're in its butt how can it see you what if we could've chased after them right away i would have chased after them immediately when it took off that's really fast though what do great eagles have giant eagles i think have really fast speed too so if the eagles were to pick up somebody-- wait you have acid resis-- no you don't because keyleth-- it went away yeah remember because she used-- gross well no i wanted the eagles to pick up pike and percy i literally am sending the eagles as this is happening and i dash out of the tree on my broom and go for the immovable rod just long enough to stop and grab it and keep taking off after the dragon it's broken no it was a bite or a claw that's my favorite kind of oatmeal oh but we have heroes' feast is that good oh that's way better you can breathe are you raging what about giant eagles with people on them don't let the bird get hit by umbrasyl do not let the bird get hit you will plummet to your fucking death i'm so far away i just want to know what he's saying is he hunter's marked still-- i haven't taken any damage how fast can my broom go and my boots of haste don't do shit to a broom you're really smart you would think to do that oh my god and you're itty bitty still i guess we head down that direction can i see what it is (laughs) vax pours a drink halt who are you what's your business here you were a runt grog was he rather small made of goats shale what were you doing out here with a scouting party it seems-- did you succeed wait you think you can kill a dragon what's the matter can you not see anything down there i pop trinket out and put vax on top of him don't you feel so tall now maybe how to get into the lair without it knowing that's wonderful how far were the dead ones plus zanror is still alive as is his wife i think well we can obviously fly would we know that healing stuff that takes too long to think about is your arm back are we going to scry it or are we just going to go how long would it take if we just flew up 20 minutes can i-- well i can't sense anything about it with hunter's mark i just know where he is and he's up in his lair moving around or is he chilling unless we fly i could also use another spell and summon a couple more eagles i could summon two more eagles and that could get how many of us up but two more eagles would get all of us up it is so they're about to go away what if we use the eagles send them up once they're used up they're gone at the top and then i'll just summon two more and send everybody else up once the people make it up the top that way it takes less time a couple people hop on the eagles right now because we only have a little bit of time left everybody hop on an eagle two of the halflings-- two of the gnomes can get on all right you guys go that is level-- oh good level three so i've got two level threes left with my pearl of power i have conjure animals not woodland beings they're too big for you teeny and because i conjured woodland animals i lost my hunter's mark i want to sleep for a day i'm going to cast pass without a trace on all of us is that your music do you want-- say that again see if it's something that would be worth-- yeah can i use my ranger skills to try to camouflage us into the side of the mountain to make us even more non-seeable add ten 32 thank you thank you for pointing that out i appreciate it how yeah did you scry yet okay i do the same thing i soot my face up too let's all make battle paint while she's scrying i get soot on my finger and walk up to percy and just put a line from his forehead down his face it was pretty small can you scry that little cavern to see where it leads to can you scry your mind up the cavern did you see umbrasyl could he still be invisible yeah go in the little hole then it's roomy well then maybe she doesn't lead the way (laughter) i'll take the horn scanlan you should take the horn i'm saying when she dies if she dies could i insight check her i feel like she's lying through her teeth (laughter) natural 20 oh i really want all those things-- does anybody want to ride the broom with me yeah wait aren't you wearing the strength gauntlets can you dispel that shit well then let's avoid them let's just go around them could you just do that the entire way into the cavern i'm on a broom do you want to ride it with me just kidding-- percy's already on oh that's acid yeah (cutesy voice) it's too small are you kidding me right now all right i will give you a minute head start to get across the room after that i'm coming in so you better hope you're at the dragon by that point how long has it been i still want to be stealthed on the broom but i take off into the cavern yes 22 are you on the broom with me still nice pike yes i'm going to fly on my broom as far in as i can and land maybe on that and just shoot arrows towards where i heard it coming from i feel like i have one blazing bowstring left because i used it once in the last battle right okay then i'm going to try it through the blazing bowstring piece of shit 19 that was just for the first attack i rolled twice for disadvantage so that's the blazing bowstring 22 on my first attack if i release trinket is that an attack or is that a bonus action raven's slumber you can make a melee attack no that's not it bonus action to release it i'm going to use a bonus action and i'm going to shout at trinket to go run towards my brother i'm going to attack it again yeah oh disadvantage 27 12 is that sneak attack because my brother is next to it so i would have gotten the sneak attack on both those or just on the one additional five 17 i want to duck down if i can behind that whatever that i'm standing on now okay i just want to duck behind it so i'm away from anything flying at me 18 she can't hear you she's deaf do we get advantage on any of it me and i think you cast it on scanlan aren't you glad i gave you the armor look at all the gold hiding over there why is that bad he doesn't save it like that i'm going to roll the brown dice for trinket dexterity 12 he's resistant to bludgeoning yes thank you nope 20 do i have any kind of sense of-- ugh your stinking cloud is right there are at disadvantage again right if trinket gets up does that use any of my stuff trinket can move freely-- so trinket is going to get up and he's going to bite umbrasyl's tail to try to distract him so i can run between his legs oh he's got a keen sense of smell so he's got advantage on smell perception well i rolled a 15 and i don't know what i add to it --oh perception seven so 22 he's going to attack him yeah i'm going to have trinket do one of his attacks so i can move and run that doesn't count i feel like it still counts though it's only 15 what does stinking cloud do to me marisha and fuck i try to run away i try to run around and run past umbrasyl but i would go through it if i tried to run between its legs i'll just try to run along to the side sure why the fuck not i'm on the broom does it matter jesus i just want to run on the broom and use my bonus action is that as far as i can get on my broom though and can i use my bonus action to hide can i try to hide i'm going to dash and i'm going to get further away yeah i'm going to hide behind those things yeah i think that hits because he's in farts cool tight tight oh that it does i'm glad i hid by another acid pool yay a strength or a dex saving throw 13 vex it's like adding insult to injury you're going to die and i'm going to call you your brother the entire time now we can watch it kill us yeah he does i don't know which one to roll here they've all been betraying me 17 he's trying man he's out he's so brave i am in the acid that's great should we write these numbers down monstah what is that hey kill that fucking dragon natural 20 why doesn't percy just always attack melee oh my god he's still alive hi okay i'm going to-- oh jeez who all is within five feet of it is everybody within five feet of it then i'm just going to attack it twice 19 plus 12 hits can i hunter's mark him yeah 19 on the first hit then the second one hits as well 17 plus 12 23 so we on the outside we can't use faerie fire it's just a bubble of dark or do we see umbrasyl peeking out oh it's that whole table he already did it yeah cut his horns off cut his wings off jump off those head things he's looking rough reckless plus necrotic plus necrotic i'm going to attack him a couple times how about that no advantage anymore though huh 18 on the first one doesn't hit that first one was way better i should've kept it the second one was 16 no i still have a bonus action so i'm going to hide with my bonus action really did you really just do that do i still have pass without trace 20 who all i'm not affected by that though because i'm outside of the bubble trinket's unconscious plus necrotic it was 60 but he was at 53 when he got hit i run over to trinket i cast cure wounds on trinket you were so brave in here that's major you know if you seek another dragon to kill you might meet us in whitestone we're forming an army there it's like kissing a child keep it going keyleth just mug down with him can i look for those too since dragons oh he probably doesn't need my help i get advantage on all dragon things it doesn't matter i rolled shit twice 12 what about all the stuff in that pile of shit i like the sound of that yeah we're totally going to go back we're going to return a lot of this gold to whiterun westruun all the towns i agree all the other gold that's just sitting around i mean we should probably just take to help the battles most of it and bring it back to westruun i said we weren't going to we're going to take it back to westruun three hours it's only been an hour no because this is going to be worth a lot of fucking money we should get some of the blood and put it in the bag of colding we don't find any of those glyphs like there were in-- not the circles i meant the transportation glyph that we beamed into his-- i can put it in the bag of colding and then it'll keep it as long as the other dragons don't realize that we've just done this would i know if they would know i don't know if it's actually safe to just hang out in this dragon's lair that's a wonderful idea yeah
