but do they your foot is melted off oh that's not bad it's four out of five can they see us there was a path further down that led further on into the tunnels i think we should follow that so we hope he used dimension door oh tiberius he has no idea what's happening we still need to hide and heal around the corner or something can we stealth further down can i use my robe of infinite twine which i have on my person in another game before because it's connected to my rope can i use that and tie it around kima and hook it to trinket so he can drag kima along okay we should just run 17 so that's trinket but we all add plus ten okay that's 20 for trinket and 29 for me no more spells okay maybe you can make it-- can i look around and and see if there's anywhere that looks like we could hide tuck in between rocks or something where we wouldn't be visible oh wait i get an advantage 20 20 cover okay let's do that i was searching for another place to hide oh lovely i think we should probably-- what (sighs) i'm okay or maybe i can use my tracking and see if i can catch a scent grog does smell are all of tiberius's things stone with him good job pike wait she can't do that again you can't do it again for kima and once we rest you'll have it again you probably should keep your voice down tiberius grog is missing actually and the queen took him we have to find grog but we have no spells if we do find him we can't do anything we should wake her up where do you touch her (laughs) you were turned to stone the king got killed the queen took grog we don't know where actually clarota got you out of that castle alive (gasps) oh my gosh wait did i hunter's mark the queen did i i can use my hunter's mark to track her it maintains for up to eight hours can i use my hunter's mark to find out where she is and then we rest and go there wait wait wait let's just find out where she is first i've got hunter's mark just stay put footless (all laugh) yes just give us one second can i use the freaking hunter's mark i don't know (whispers) the city they're close (louder) so that is right in front of the keep they are in the city and pop up perhaps where she is all of us or just you is it all of us or just you well but then you will be alone surrounded by duergar and grog i'm going to only sleep for a little bit cause i didn't use all my spells i only need to rest for half the amount of time maybe i think we'll be fine because she needs to rest as well we hurt her pretty badly we've got to sleep keyleth you can do it pike maybe this yellow vial of potion could do something for it as well why do you keep putting your foot up near me (all laugh) it looks really disgusting by the way it's so gross you don't have any feet left (all laugh) you've got a toe nubbin a teeny tiny little knife he will live (gasps) with the dude with the black horn i'm concentrating so hard (all laugh) maybe we should just calm down and go to sleep how do you feel now (all laugh) tiberius shh that was weird right good night trinket go sleep with vax thank you for telling us tiberius so have we healed completely (gasps) where's it moving where which direction wait where is that in relation to us we should go that direction you have no power over me well it went that way we should go as stealthily as possible so we don't alert the entire freaking camp i try to make it look like we weren't around this area as much as possible without our dust of tracelessness so technically lady kima we might be able to get back in eventually and get your weapon and there's a vault we should go look for grog oh i don't know which one to roll 24 oh i didn't roll for trinket hold on trinket shush oh i didn't feed him today he's probably so hungry fresh-ish oh no the only time i've seen duergar split across like this was when we saw the camp of that creepy centipede creature yeah do i see any of those kind of tracks around it's going to be that centipede creature thingy stitch monster i like it it's a good name can i tell if grog definitely came this way what do i add that to i don't understand oh okay cool natural explorer primeval awareness i don't have any idea what i'm looking for (all laugh) it's a survival check okay oh good so that's 22 two grooves i wonder if they have him prisoner now if he came out of his mind funk lovely well grog definitely came this way as did the stitch monster so you don't have much choice but to follow be aware we're all very aware of-- any movement at all happening is this still the underdark i can't sense anything or any creatures nearby ugh great can i use my primeval awareness and see if i can sense grog within six miles of us oh i can use an action to focus my awareness on a region around me and then i can sense whether-- oh well no it's only certain types of creatures well no it says aberrations celestials dragons elementals fey fiends and undead really so what do we do so we have to go beyond it can we keep to the edge and try to not disturb the rock as much as possible oh it's that high are there any rocks around us any big rocks anything loose anything i can grab near us yeah anything to throw as far as i can out and see if it-- can you send your light source up can anybody send light up and see how high the ceiling goes okay thanks there's no way to avoid it tiberius how many times can you cast pillars of whatever pillars how many times can you cast grand columns could we potentially walk on columns across this thing potentially what about a wall from out from the side yeah what were you going to say hop so that might not be enough trinket hop on this rock a lot trinket's a boy i'm not leaving trinket behind so everybody get on that and we'll see what happens okay yeah how about you guys go and i'll stay with trinket you guys go it's like half a mile oh just do it i don't sense any undead with my primal awareness do i oh and kima pike pray do something well trinket what do you want to be a lizard a mouse a kitten (gasps) a kitten you want to be a kitten oh he's a persian you're the cutest trinket i tuck him into my shirt he's so cute let's go come on let's get on this thing grog's getting ahead of us the rock would be less it's a very thin piece of stone quick float us do we see anything i'm keeping an eye out see if i see any movement or anything that's maybe sparkles i don't know what's it sound like go can we go faster that's not grog we're going to toward a monster oh it's really good we're not standing on it how much does he weigh (giggles) i punch him in the face we wanted to throw him as far as we could two three (whispering) go faster go faster oh my god we're going to fight we're going to fight this thing oh god we're all stuck on a single piece of rock ooh i like it 21 yay hunter's mark right on that guy okay i'm going to lightning arrow him oh i can't do that because i hunter's marked him i'm going to hail of thorns that guy okay at level three through my bow of blazing bowstring 22 yes yes so then i roll my regular damage plus 3d10 okay whoa so 14 for the first 4d10 this is crazy four 11 19 21 yes oh plus hunter's mark damage six hop off no way i'm not stepping on this bone shit that's my turn oh he's tucked into my armor i get two because it's favored terrain right yes okay good 23 oh man it's a girl why is that demeaning can he heal us that's where we landed that's something that's something percy that's better than a one that's good that's good plus anything it's on your spell page oh okay on the ground you look up like oh oh acid none of us have gotten hit yet all right i don't want to hit lady kima with any of my attacks so i'm just going to have to do i'm going to do the blazing bowstring again and i'm going to attack it twice ooh that was a 30 29 and 23 14 points of damage on the first one (laughs) what did i do on that that was weird 14 on the second one as well but with hunter's mark-- she's still hunter's marked four kima's being held by him nice blind scanlan kima all of us except for percy i think it's better than one clarota it's better than one 13 plus your spell thing should i roll for pike 19 oh 19 and then for trinket-- oh no no oh plus her-- wait i'm looking up her constitution plus one 17 seven but i rolled a 19 (gasps) 28 points oh shit boom all of a sudden my bosom comes flying out no in the bones five

then can he can he try to climb up and get away from it oh no he'll take a hit won't he do it oh god but he's so low on health he's right next to it get up trinket get up on the wall and i'm going to cast hail of thorns on the thing five feet what is it is it an acrobatics athletics i don't know what to add but it's 19 plus whatever strength 23 oh it hits oh no trinket's unconscious oh no he's lying in the skeletons do i get to-- can i move if i attack or is that it will somebody save trinket okay then i still attack him but wait will i do damage to trinket then still on the ground
