hufflepuff his name is trinket all right this is so awkward yeah scoot the bench down look at how far the bench is on our side thanks for joining us this week longest announcements ever the one that everybody wants but nobody can have you can read yeah i'll surprise you with it don't worry he's not fine i ask everyone to wait percy can you look through your scope and see who that is the music are they from here we don't have a lot of magic wielders with us though a lot of magic wielders sounds good perfect so avoid the skeletons they're in the way keyleth are they in the path at all do they look like they're going to be near us when we go i do but keyleth the minute we start fighting they will notice us and then they'll attack us from behind i guess i use pass without a trace on all of us did we already have it from last time it holds for up to an hour sweet 30 oh shit i forgot about that (whispering) good job scanlan no no guns i shoot it with an arrow okay just going for it okay i'm literally i think i cursed myself sometime between here and san francisco 18 15 damage oh that's sneak attack right because i'm hidden extra two i was doing the one that was walking towards us i thought the other ones were still in the area-- yeah okay i hide 39 stealth yeah do they all-- did any of the other ones notice that ah shit they were attacking us they were attacking him well you should keep a leash on them then put them in a bright color put a happy mask on them or something so people know they're nice you make candles but you also make undead can i insight and see if he's telling the truth 17 well you know what we're on our way to do just that thing vox machina thank you then you'll help us it would be very strange carol and coral yeah tell you what gern we're actually-- we should probably press on and you can join us with your family perfect we're short on magic people that's wonderful are we still trying to stealth or does it even matter all right we head towards the thing does my pass without a trace work on him too does it like envelop him-- they're worse than trinket scanlan okay no no she's done that really does it still look like keyleth or-- what does it look like pretty freaking sick can you talk to it i thought we were supposed to keep them from coming out into this world maybe you should ask it to go back i take my potion of fire resistance do it i think it's going well good job keyleth they're turning around they're heading back in that direction you're very scary right now dear yeah yeah yeah what pressure perception shut up 30 no 28 on everything no even better i follow behind him and keep watching him can i see what it was should we let them know we're in place then i'm going to set an arrow on fire and shoot it up in the air no i'm going to tie some of my cloth from-- you know-- that i have-- the thing i take some cloth from the bag of holding from one of those old fancy cloaks that we have (sighs) seriously can i have some of the fancy cloak grog out of the bag of holding please jesus christ please no idea if they saw that all the other teams already responded we were the third i hunter's mark the big one i'm vex'ahlia nice to meet you maybe we should duck down so that nobody knows where that came from nice fatty no we should probably attack i hide should we roll for stealth again or are we still stealthed oh i know i was trying to hide though like back away from you as you were doing that you're at the portal that's okay we're all going to die the big one that i hunter's marked whoa look at how pretty those lava bubbles look 13 so many times it was inevitable this is why i sort my dice at the beginning of the game yay what matt and when when can we hold it (mocking gern's accent) farty-far pints o' cald damage awesome wait so they can unfreeze or are they basically frozen until something-- (groans) okay that yellow one behind me that's keyleth right okay i know right i'm going to flip backwards like ten feet i don't want to be around anybody else so i'm going to flip over the lava pit and go out there that would be 38 and i hunter's mark the guy attacking near percy and scanlan and i shoot two arrows into him ugh where is my thing hold on sorry (giggles) 21 and 17 17 on the first hit and then 18 on the second hit yeah yes that's vax they'll probably melt eventually oh shit yeah just push 'em over smash them do the other one now you could hang a coat on him we have a bag of holding oh there's a giant monster i hunter's mark it is it close by not tonight though ah so much is that behind him is that what the-- oh my gosh so do some cold stuff like this guy pass without a trace is that still in effect no 22 19 nobody cares marisha what no you have advantage so maybe one of those would be a 20 if you rerolled them with their advantages are those trees do they have any substance at all or are they just there to look pretty all right i'm going to try to use one as protection i'm going to hop behind the one over this way and i'm going to hunter's mark the efreeti and then i'm going to use my longbow of the sky sentinel and i'm going to shoot him three times that first one probably does not succeed it is a 16 what about 23 all right how about mega miss so one of those hits because i'm a loser 11 17 points of damage and that's it because i suck i am hiding behind the tree these piece-of-shit dice do dragonborn have natural fire resistance oh no oh my gosh that's a lot of gallons for sure fuck yeah do that again keyleth okay am i hiding am i hidden what is that number it's completely smooshed off of the dice there's literally-- but i had my skirmisher stealth yeah it's fine it's fine it's fine all right then i'm just going to everything's a concentration thing so i'm just going to lightning arrow the giant fire guy yeah okay 30 that's 4d8 lightning damage on a hit 18 that's it yeah okay i'm going to use my bonus action to hide then with the skirmisher's thing for my skirmisher stealth i can use a bonus action to hide you told me i swear okay where was it okay where is it i don't know where it is i'll find it and then i'll find out and then i'll roll for stealth then if it works my stealth roll is 15 it doesn't even matter it's not in the book it's in the-- 15 i feel really bad that i killed carol now use it i have the skirmisher stealth as a bonus action at the end of your turn you can make a dexterity (stealth) check to hide again did the skeleton and the zombie start dancing better after that being pissed why am i laughing at that hey scanlan what are we going to do with this giant ball can you bring it down keyleth are you going to bat him down like you're sweeping the sky how come everybody flies there's flying brooms oh shit i run forward to try to help him out hunter's mark it wasn't because i used lightning arrow so it dropped the concentration on it although it doesn't really matter because i'm going to cast lightning arrow on him and i lose my hunter's mark again oh yeah oh that's 31 31 okay 23 that's better i'm going to use my movement to run up around the molten lava and hold my hand out for gern so that he can use me to get out of the molten lava okay take my hand do you need me to hold your broom while you cast your spell thank you yes jesus christ i mean it didn't kill him i walk up to grog i pat him on the shoulder and say that was so impressive a genuine mage and i use sleight of hand to shove the flying broom into the bag of holding 18 oh no oh no your broom fell in the lava i saw it i tried to give it back to you and it fell in the lava yeah 18 i'm so sorry i wouldn't know i don't even know a tragedy candle grog you should probably help them with all of your magic powers just hold your hands up hold your hands up oh yeah like fiery candles maybe oh no that's what you said i can use-- i don't know if it will help but i have a really great diamond of awesomeness that's precious i don't know i don't know how this magic stuff works do you have any magic stuff scanlan matador it his diamond earring is glistening in the light i walk up and i cast cure wounds on him i've got jack shit at a level three for you i am i am 20 points yes i know and it's so kind of him look at all these treasures he's going to find here for his candles 18 do you collect dragon scales for your candles gern
