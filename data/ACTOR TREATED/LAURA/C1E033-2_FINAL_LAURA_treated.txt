can we expect any more traps that you're aware of do you want it just in case yours misfires wait where did you get it i had it in my belt i have it this music is awful as you're checking giving him a loaded gun can i insight check her to see if she's telling the truth 24 okay that's good i take that pistol back from you we don't have that it has to be attuned over a short rest though give it some time yeah yeah yeah all right what is lady briarwood the guy that they're trying to bring back (gasps) (whispering) what if it's the guy in percy percy's smoke monster what is trinket and he's wearing little circle glasses are we going in to fight now i'm stealthing should i cast pass without a trace yeah i'm going to use pass without a trace because i don't have a lot of 2nd-level spells yeah plus ten to your stealth yeah natural 20 oh natural 20 that's 29 that's 39 39 for me how do you know it's him this is really creepy because it's brother and sister talking to each other right now it looks like percival and cassandra he will be no you can't have it because i want it he's got his flaming war hammer i'm going to perception ahead so i'll be towards the front he's going to stay further back trinket's staying close to scanlan oh no she's so drunk (make snatching noises) i don't remember it wasn't very good trained in arcana how do you know if you're trained in arcana oh that's it i wonder if this was holding that acid do i see any recent tracks around here does it look like people came down here 13 it looks like there's some tracks here but i don't know what it's saying they're already open and empty 11 with a different dice ridiculous yeah we need to go oh he's taken over her body we're all immune to fear because of the feast is this charm we're going to die (muffled) we don't even have a cleric with us what you have to roll initiative to see when you attack all of us 13 we don't have a cleric he cast turn undead we don't have that yeah magic glove yeah you did i feel really inspired it's just your little staff all right oh god am i close by him i'm right next to him oh no i back away from him he's going to get an attack on me but i really needed to put some distance there wait okay that's good you don't hit me i'm going to have trinket-- is he lined up with anybody he can't cannonball through to grog and keyleth can you dodge scanlan right you deserve it he's doing it halved eight plus 16 is 24 okay so keyleth is 24 scanlan is 18 and grog is 18 no grog is 20 i don't know what to roll for cannonball damage because i've never actually gotten to hit okay for each person oh okay so ten for keyleth seven plus four is 11 for scanlan oh less for grog eight and while he's doing-- i don't get to shoot an arrow yes i do i get to shoot an arrow i'm going to shoot an arrow as trinket is hitting grog oh god 14 doesn't hit him and now trinket is close to me then did he go through them and get back to me shit shit doesn't hit grog grog no no the first one didn't hit so you only get the 20 oh yeah because she cast-- that's why i'm superstitious about my dice he also touched mine and i rolled a three i like that you're violent instead of just going healing hand you go fuck you yeah you have a constitution saving throw of eight trinket rolled an 11 get them unconscious so they come out but then if they're unconscious the ghosts come out and they could possess us and i'm in a fight with grog okay this is totally awesome she's not doing anything i just thought she was being a bitch trinket runs forward and tries to pull grog's focus so that i can back away he tries to grapple him or something can he do anything to make grog not be able to attack me if i run away can he try to knock him down or something jump up on his back and knock him over okay yeah no problem an athletics check for me okay 12 i'm going to try to roll out of the way i'm going to try to duck down and roll out of the way to make him less likely to hit me okay oh my dice suck tonight that's good acrobatics 28 as my bonus action i'm going to cast-- right i don't want to use any of my shit i can't but that's a really good idea for my bonus action i'm going to go help oh no yay oh she's a rogue oh right percy's still-- i mean not badly but-- i see the ghost come out of her okay i'm going to shoot it with my blazing bowstring 16 17 i want a good one 17 25 for my second attack i'm going to attack percy can i see him all right i'm going to do it 21 16 that was also through my blazing bowstring yeah plus another five that was another five burning damage how do we even know who's who it was it's a magic war hammer good times oh no he rolled a crit oh jeez louise the west of the way what if we take a short rest yeah we can roll some hit dice that was insane well
