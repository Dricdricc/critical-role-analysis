it's just the first month it's just $3 off the very first month it's $3 just for writing a word that's right that's right already already oh my god ready to go to the actual castle we're back from the feywild if he doesn't remember we went does that mean i lose my title oh no baroness lady vex'ahlia baroness of the third house of whitestone grand mistress of the grey hunt i don't know anything about the grey hunt but it's written down on a piece of paper you gave me percy that i actually threw out because i fixed up my notes so i don't have the piece of paper in this world binder no no it's definitely right here he did and it's just it's in my-- so i don't have it i would still have it it's just not in this particular not-in-that-world binder keeps it under her arm the whole time it's got a happy kitten on it that says hang in there life needs things to live grog oh here it's right here right here that's your handwriting don't you see it oh god and grog's just content sitting over here completely blank but wait are you just going to make up what he remembers no lady vex'ahlia baroness of the third house of whitestone and the grand mistress of the grey hunt of the third house of whitestone of all the ten minutes to have him remember maybe that's not the one to focus on make up something wonderful for him he's wanted to go there his entire life make something magical oh no you remember approved oh grog it's really badass you killed the guy that was holding it you wait is this normal would we have known that this is normal for people to lose their memory when they come out of the fucking feywild we wouldn't have learned any of that in our studies no (whispers) i was a studious child i was a very studious child he cheated off my tests all the time i was incredibly studious grog did this happen last time you went to the feywild when you-- do you remember-- okay you killed so many things grog you fought so many people no we need to find pike pike came to help us five days there's gilmore we could talk to him allura maybe she can help i make sure trinket's out of the necklace lots of diseases percy your sketchbook you made sketches the entire time you used your lightning javelin you-- yes you have a little statue you have a little statue grog it's black onyx means black it's an onyx mastiff it's an onyx statuette of mastiff if you use an action to speak the command word-- i know and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you it becomes a living mastiff for up to six hours it was etched on the bottom and i totally understand it i do it's right there it's insta-dog it fights it has sight and hearing checks it bites and it claws just like-- oh no it just bites i'm looking i'm looking the creature reverts to its figurine form it reverts to a figurine early if it drops to zero hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it when the creature becomes a figurine again its property can't be used again for ugh seven days mastiff has an intelligence of eight (laughs) and can speak common it's smarter than you yeah and objects within that range sorry i didn't mean to read all that and make it not interesting we know it it's good doggie you can say it in common he understands common yeah that's it grog i'm sorry how are things here cassandra might know so you're leading an army and what's your role in it we have faith in you jarett yes we were wondering what happened to him pardon our appearance and stench we're covered in that black messiness i assume another vestige i would love for you to take a look at it shaun thank you did you bring any other survivors with you did you say thordak's wife did i mishear you wife and guards is what i heard and i was so fucking confused you've done so much she's the one that released thordak so that wouldn't surprise me draconia shit balls motherfucker gilmore does the screen keep us hidden i'm going outside too wait skywrite no they don't they don't necessarily i wouldn't skywrite anything right now keyleth that screen could keep us hidden he could be searching for us right now yes 16 send out the guards no don't do it i'll follow behind grog i pull out the broom and i get on the broom it's not clear we could just be in their way people would just come out screaming they won't know where to go they don't see us but they know we're nearby we need to get everybody underground while we can spread the word tell everyone to get underground can we send people under the castle as well don't empty out the earth too much or it won't support the city where's gilmore gilmore good job where's pike i drop her because i'm fucking weak you did an amazing job with that no it was fine he doesn't remember pike i don't know maybe there's a way to cure it grog that's not possible no i think it's gotten quite a bit away from us no he did he still killed the big bad guy yeah well stoned can you only do that one time a day potentially what oh but they're so fun to look through all right can we tell the people as they come out i know you'll want to celebrate but please keep it as quiet as possible tonight we don't know when it could be back gilmore and pike allura he was like who's shaun can i fly up in the air while this conversation's going on not too high no i know i want to go to the very top where i see the shimmer okay but it's high enough that i mean it's higher than the castle okay the direction that the dragons went is this stupid can i shoot my oracle arrow in that direction why it's an arrow oh well i guess that's true i thought it was a ten-minute because it's fenthras i thought it was a long-ass arrow oh wait okay so the oracle arrow is it like you fire it and then it shoots somewhere and it sticks there and i can see through it for ten minutes that makes sense i foresaw it just going because i thought it was like a special kind of arrow right cool then i'm not going to use it because now i understand how it works i've learned something can i cast primeval awareness and see if it's within six miles of us right now still or if it's farther away from that i want to see if they're just camping out around us or if they're going away yes it's my favored enemy okay they're further than six miles away okay no no we don't have whisper technically the elves of syngorn are building an army however who knows if they'll actually come through in the feywild no our guards aren't in syngorn no oh we did i was distracted yeah we need to move everybody underground the same way we did in emon that's wonderful that's smart yeah they don't like us that's true umbrasyl dead and gone yeah and if not that then the message left in there the white one was more vain yeah they like to make people suffer shut up there's notes somewhere in here maybe the next one we can sign as somebody else have any what raishan saw us the white one saw us all of them saw us gilmore was scrying on them it took three days for him to get here that's how he knew they struck during a political-- somebody has to be telling them things it could be raishan taking the form of a human again for all we know yes how are the citizens did you get everyone in there what are you doing oh you're just hoping first one was really good about jarett you're insighting jarett get you a drink i think yes we need to talk about barricading underground making it more secure we've got some fancy-ass bottles just one bottle between the two of you we saw thordak there actually why do you ask grog i bet that sounds something pike would like one is in marquet good times yes you do if you don't mind abyssal that's where demons come from that's the thing that killed pike months and months whisper right we're so tired we need to take it-- just guessing wait what we can't move it so they can't scry into the room it cancels all magic how long is the travel to marquet no it's not about time the dragon is sitting on top of draconia unless we know how to take on that dragon we can't save anyone seeker asum is telling people that this city has been magicked away we're just reiterating the things that you told us you were going to say plus it's really fun to say your name there's definitely at least-- when you're scrying on a tree are we sneaky you have your memories of the feywild do you remember sloshing around in that black sludge very loudly it's on i can't believe if we fight one that means we have to fight-- how are we going to do that though oh and how would you do it grog oh my god grog he will never see through that that's brilliant right we know that what if somebody can polymorph into a little green dragon or something fuck shit up as a dragon and leave evidence behind as a green dragon or the green dragon vorugal is the white dragon how do you know vorugal doesn't know yeah but the white dragon might have some way to communicate they have other balls right it's very loud we saw orbs in umbrasyl's that was in brimscythe's he shattered them fuck so that we wouldn't be able to scry on anyone else or he was pissed yeah he would deny it of course he would deny it even if he jumps to conclusions he would be pissed would i know how fast dragons can actually fly if it's a two-week trip to get to draconia from where we are-- okay if they were flying how fast could they get there potentially check it out and get out before they get back they've probably left a good amount of army there to keep people under control we'd have to get in and out in a couple of hours we don't have them it would take them a few days to get there have you seen the lizard people okay wait what really the only point of going there would be reconnaissance that's it no fighting no that sounds wonderful but if we get people out they're going to know something happened plus if we're lizard people the survivors aren't going to be wanting-- they're going to be afraid of us so we wouldn't be able to bamf out oh fuck nope this is danger zone we can sleep and wake up in the morning and teleport there we can't fucking go there when we haven't slept grog we'll all die they're so nice good plan guys good plan i wish you guys could see it up close obviously we're going to send a picture on twitter so you guys can see it but it lights up different colors it's got elvish for protector and growth did i say it right protector not protection protector is right say what thank you so much you're unbelievable lean it up against the table by the way i got terrible sleep i replayed everything saundor said in my head a hundred times i am terrible wisdom saving throw 12 baked beans tell me there's baked beans it's terrifying a rambling de rolo vote then i've changed my mind i want to go to marquet now sorry oh shit i didn't mean to fuck that up trinket what's your vote yeah what is what what is it let it be known i don't think we should go as lizard people anymore i think we should go as ravaged draconians at least that way they'll trust us pop in scry pop into draconia look around and next day pop out can we do that no we're going to draconia how can we go there blindly if you don't know where a tree is we would only scry on a tree we wouldn't scry on a dragon it'll still take a couple of hours to get there though it's 500 in the morning are you not scrying on a tree that's what he just said i've also got a scrying stone here no it's a scrying eye you can use it once a day i was going to bring it out it was just sitting there it's true maybe scry on lockheed at least you got one for free jutting out the side of-- okay i have an idea what if we tie a rope on something on this side and we all go out of the rope really fast and drop down they could potentially see us as soon as we come out of the tree this is risky you're the one that was most adamant about us going there why scanlan okay before we go through i'm going to cast pass without a trace on us so we can stealth through the tree like that's going to work i'm going to look for something very solid are there trees around us that we can go through right now all right i'm going to tie the rope off onto a very sturdy thing next to a tree that we're going to go through yes jump out you saw rubble but there's things that were crawling around amongst the dead no because that's dumb we're going to break our backs i'm going to cast pass without a trace on everyone right now because why the fuck not oh yeah i'm on the broom and he's on the broom i fly through stealthily i'm trying to get down to the ground quickly and hide behind something 33 we get down on the ground and go under and you're covered in wings 25 25 can i whisper in draconic lockheed and whatever the word is for come to me i pull out some of my food that i give to trinket and try to feed it i cast speak with animals is he an animal i would have known as a dragon expert that he's not a fucking animal then whatever i didn't fall i flew perch him on my shoulder and get out some more of the little boar meat we have in the bag of colding and feeding him can i speak draconic to him see if he understands any of that yeah i know i say where is tiberius in draconic where is home all right stay could we tell what kind of creatures they are don't do red maybe it's good to make us silvers and whiteish gern didn't have a tail and he was less than-- i don't think draconians will like us without a tail rags put us in rags like we've been living in rubble make us look like we've been beat up oh shit who all speaks draconic here don't actually speak japanese grog okay i'm stealthily leading us that direction towards where the lair is and for any of the lizard creatures coming towards us then let's quietly make our way that direction let's injuredly keep walking do we see any books that seem interesting as we're walking through them that means raishan was here the people that are scouring through the rubble are those dragonborn or just the lizard people can we look at their behavior and see what it looks like they're doing 13 this isn't having to do with dragons so it's 13 friends friends of stormwinds i walk up injuredly pardon my friends their tongues have been cut out by our captors i'm all that's left you know what i don't know what to tell you everyone with a tail's an asshole we got what was coming to us 19 i can shoot he makes boots she's really good at stonecraft choice b oh they're going to know as soon as we're in chains oh shall we drop seeming perhaps we should drop seeming wait i have to tell you something we're not actually draconian well we have some really good magic users with us look forgive us for making tails we don't know anything about your culture we're idiots we came here because we know you're under attack and we're trying to help yep because we're stupid 14 drop seeming just drop it i know i'm sorry no believe me you don't want the tail i repeat him here's the thing you're being attacked by a white dragon so you're happy with it right but now that the sky-walkers have already been torn down do you want to keep the dragon in charge so you serve one and he doesn't punish you at all he's a good master really bad how can we help that's what we're here for gladly but not in chains we do this freely i'm sorry that's not happening that we will yeah add that to the list our entire landscape is under attack now vorugal has helped you but they've made many others suffer not just draconians entire cities brought down for nothing we're here to right the wrong and help in any way we can tooma we knew that was going to happen who is tooma i explain everything that's happening in common as we walk is everyone still cool with this we're going to the chieftain they actually said they wanted us to chop firewood so if we can get sent on that mission we're set are we in the mountains no are we we have to go they're walking us to the chieftain can't just walk away now do they have tails nobody has tails down here that would probably work at this point right tooma we apologize for coming in the guise of your enemies unfortunately we don't know much about your culture and no one ever informed us of what you have suffered and we apologize 23 yes much deserved they do that i want nothing more for you than that let us help you much relieved yes they do we will do everything in our power to watch it die it should be back very soon can i roll an insight check on her 19 well we tried to do that one other time while it did pay off and its brother is dead a lot of people died in the process a lot very large strong people the risk here is that by destroying vorugal-- we'll bring the wrath of the others upon you thordak is much larger and i don't think he's been here lots of different places as you can see we're half-elves tooma are the frigid doom's armies around will they see us we certainly don't want them to see ours can you cast seeming again wait if you cast seeming will we still be able to get into the-- he was the guy that we talked to right when we got here can i tell tooma as we walk out ps if that dragon comes back we need to bolt thank you we lost a day but the dragon will still take the same amount of time do we see any big trees around here tooma is vorugal having you collect all of this and when you can't find anything what then i got a natural 20 when i dropped it giving up on it what is its nature is it vain does it want you to bow before it can i roll an insight check on her again jesus this is creepy 27 what are you guys talking about check for fucking traps before we go in there yeah let's not do that today this is reconnaissance can i stand on the top and look out from the platform and see what is visible from the platform and what areas seem hidden in the landscape i don't even need to look good oh this is pertaining to dragons we're all looking 16 they'll be able to scry on us for sure if we steal it they see us the minute we looked into brimscythe's do you speak dragon you have a great idea of how to kill it and also you're right in front of the scrying circle we spoke to tooma in common if we attack one dragon we start the war that is something we've been told over and over once one more is dead they'll probably all attack the greatest plan we have is what grog came up with which is pitting them against each other we came here to find out what its lair looked like in every aspect scanlan disgusting don't you didn't say that out loud you did not just say that out loud can we just step away from the orb while we talk can we sketch what it looks like i think you should sketch percy maybe urukat would want to come and fight a dragon what would we leave i don't want them able to scry on us i could leave trees too tooma just in case something happens and a big red dragon comes to pick a fight everyone hide get out of the way i think we got the information-- what kind of creatures do you offer to it for hunt how will we be able to communicate with them for them to let us know fucking shit balls scanlan we don't do that yep if you do that he'll know something is different we're about to get attacked back to emon he always loved them are any of the ravenites around us or are we alone is lockheed still on my shoulder i bring him down so he can say goodbye i get lockheed out of there i don't want him to stay in do you want to come in draconic i say it's all right i put my hand on keyleth's shoulder he loved you well princess were you going to leave a tree outside of the ravine man thanks loot crate
