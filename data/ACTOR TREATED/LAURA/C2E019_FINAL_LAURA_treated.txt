did you think that was going to be loud enough no no don't clap that's so quiet it's beautiful somebody wasn't asked this girl right here oops you know there are other things happening i totally was like nobody asked me all the oops sorry guys yes and if they're still there the vox machina dice set is around as well i know i tweeted it out because i was like no one told me that one was in that's exciting yes i think we should go talk to him that seems like it would be smart right is it what if what he wants us to do means that we have to stay here for a while though like for a lot of money would you stay what if the table offers you four times the amount you've ever seen yeah i remember he was trapped down by the spider the ones we made fun of woo go thed i'm going to jump up on the table and watch it jump up on the table you can see better finish him does that happen often in here fight me fight me right now do you want to do it just hit each other you piece of shit 22 i'm going to punch her in the face and cast inflict wounds at first level i could do it at third but i'm doing it at first yeah 18 oh no 3d10 i think so 17 i don't know oh shit yeah no it doesn't hit normally 18 i should have done it 3rd-level oh god oh no five no six oh no i think i pooped myself a little that was my shield yeah oh no it hurts already i'm going to use my reaction because i'm not stunned to use hellish rebuke on you fuck oh no nope aww no i'm unconscious and then caleb fucked me (coughing) whoa that was seriously awesome i would have done it worse but i thought we were taking it easy on each other and then you went crazy on me i understand completely how come you were you hitting me so much though because usually you don't have that much speed that was a while ago oh hi frumpkin you're a little evil creature that drinks blood no it's totally fine i did it to myself i don't like him that was creepy i'm going to use this time talking to him as a short rest well hopefully-- yes we have actually like swap creatures leading to berleben febron keyes okay well the other side of that was that we would get access to some potions and supplies and stuff is this something you can provide to us when we go on missions for you natural 20 (cheering) i think it sounds like fun shadygrove no shadycreek well that would be probably the second one right how do you feel about it yasha well i mean we're all leaning more towards this than going to the menagerie coast for the empire right that is as contract-y as contract gets (gasps) it does we can stop by hupperdook i have no idea i imagine that all of the buildings look like mushrooms yes we have to be careful of those monsters that came out of the-- it's not sweat i think it's-- i'm going to peek around and look at the gentleman is he moist eight what kind of shirt is he wearing the thing is if he was sweaty then why would he be wearing long sleeves he doesn't look like he's warm though normally when people are sweaty they're going like this (breathing heavily) you know we go in we try to find fabron keyes and secure the safehouse in the swamp and there's howling there so probably wolves or something secure it and come back and tell him where it is-- yeah so we need to go to berleben or we need to go to the swamp come back here and then go i think we should call them dookies what are we going to do if he's not exactly wouldn't it be better if we just don't know the greying wildlands are in the north i just want to make sure we're here for a full hour though i'm going to drink slowly i'm going to sip it i thought you get a point of exhaustion after haste am i going to be able to heal enough what i'll just use the one little spell all of it hmm-mm we're going to do that one and then the other one we'll say yes to both not quiet the passage that we were in poison and healing got it you will get 107 gold thank you well one and then-- oh i run back to the gentleman should we come back here after the first part or should we continue on and take care of them both and then come tell you that way you know we did it timely and we can get that bonus part okay yeah we already packed our rooms up no more pumat's as i leave i flick the wand of smiles at him again now i feel guilty it's cleared out we have horses you can ride a horse two horses pulling the cart five we have six horses i'll drive the cart i'll drive the cart when someone kicks him and he poofs does he automatically go to the other place or does he die for a little bit and come back my mother never did but the traveler told me lots of stories of everywhere there's faeries and that is how the unicorns get over here do you have wolves to the swamp i bet someone's going to try to jump out at us they do that to people that are on the open road that's really shit we should probably pull over or something and look around and see that's a fast burn that's not going to last very long we could camp on top of the cart because we won't be on the ground it's warmer on there i'll take first watch with him yeah it's not awesome but it's not horrible i'm helm oh goddamn it 13 that was an easy watch then what you guys i was at a disadvantage we're all camping together oh you guys are still on your watch it's so brisk and wonderful do you think the gentleman wakes up with frost on his face or his whole body i wonder if he has to crack himself he has to wash them every night they would be so gross hey nott do you think we're going to go by your hometown when we're driving up here oh really so you're nomadic do you have little huts you put up as camping tents did you like that i don't know i've never tried it is that why you left i saw you no i could tell you but i feel like it's offensive or something well my mom used to tell me that if you act up too much the goblins will come in the middle of the night and steal you away yeah and would you eat because my mom said you would eat them did you ever eat a little child nott do you even know who your brothers and sisters are oh that sounds a little shitty fjord like what maybe we do everyone likes bacon bacon is super good yeah she doesn't want to hurt her baby caleb is it into the woods or is it further along it's a small shack should we go knock on the door no we'll just keep going the shack is a mile away can frumpkin be a bird not for me though caleb hates me i want people to like me you're checking out the shack did you kill someone for that great maybe we should just live here instead of going anywhere else let's keep going don't fuck this up fjord have you ever tried human before i'm going to start making a nice pretty bed in the cart it's going to be really nice looking for anyone who wants to stay in here with me then i'm going to crumple them up never mind what or a sleep arrow at least we got a surprise attack that's good oh my god they're huge wolves goblins oh shit balls you don't want to curse it right i was expecting another six they are goblins as i'm lifting my shield the other one gets underneath it oh no natural 20 did i take damage from that one arrow 16 hits the goblin he has 40 movement (screaming) caleb if i fucking waste one of my fucking spells caleb i rush over and i cast cure wounds at 2nd-level to heal caleb that would be 2d8 plus four oh that's 12 plus eight so 20 points of healing (crying) it's not working i don't know what's going on i'm going to use my bonus action-- i'm going to use my bonus action to cast sacred flame at the ogre that is attacking us oh it is i'm sorry i was thinking because it's a cantrip-- you're right bonus action there's not really anything i can do is there (tearily) i'm going to try to drag caleb away from the fire behind yasha great caleb fucking me again natural 20 how much eight and nine that's 17 wait no i think-- did i no i did that wrong didn't i shit balls anyway strength saving throws i got to close out of that okay strength 12 and 13 i'm going to cast hellish rebuke in response to one of the-- that would be 15 points of damage to him you stay away you piece of-- it's okay you're still really cool looking though that's what poison does you get disadvantage on all your attacks if you're poisoned that sucks you're alive how did-- whoa we need to get you some ac i saw one that was good and i was like oh no okay i'm going to cast sacred flame at the wolf in front of me it's dex sacred flame does not succeed 2d8 oh five damage to him dang it then i'm going to cast for my bonus action spiritual weapon here oh you have one i want it right in front of me because i might as well have it crash down on the wolf as well okay that is 16 that is a d8 plus four that's nine points of damage to the wolf damn it yeah because i can't move he'll attack me but he's going to attack me anyway he could attack caleb though he'll probably attack me i'm going to stay right there oh no it happens oh it's magnets ha hit under his arm hit his ribs like you did with me hit his ribs hey yeah 17 (texan accent) drink of water yeah molly are you an angel at home you mean you were the only one of your family that had it (gasp) have you tried okay what did you say do you want us to leave the table her face looks angry just all of us staring at you i pull down my spiritual weapon and start licking it only the parts that hit the wolf and the ogre hello xhorhas xhorhasian i think he's a spy are they wearing underwear (horrified yelling) i'm going to draw that in my journal oh my gods can you imagine what would have happened if they were all over us when we woke up did you hang out with ogres too nott are you okay was it weird to fight other goblins oh you liked it what oh you were nott a torturer what happened to him did you leave before he did (whispers) really did you love him what was the distraction that's good wow but your goblin friends knew where the village was why but you helped him what if we cast disguise person on you and you could find out if he was okay what if after we do this we go down there and see we just killed two ogres and some wolves and a bunch of other goblins we could probably do some serious damage to your old mean tribe just because you look like them doesn't mean that you have to be like them there's that creepy smile again beau maybe there is a comma travis and maybe not though maybe some of them are nice like you in your tribe have you gone to other tribes maybe you were just in a really shitty tribe i don't know if we will all fit i'm okay in the rain i am i need to sleep i got injured i'm going to sleep oh all right
