it is you do actually ashley i think i got shirts for you when is that again a teeny-tiny poop just from sam oh oh my goodness i wish we had the box in front of us but go look it up it's got this box on the top and then it separates on the bottom and you can put your dice in the bottom yeah check it out did you see it ashley yeah we'll watch it on the break i've been in rehearsal all day for this because we literally got an email about it as we were starting yeah they're refugees probably we float down we float down yeah we can't we're in mist form (hissing) i think we should help them maybe we can -- maybe we can send them back to whitestone i float down into the trees outside of the camp around there near the rocks so that we're in camouflage no it looks like a refugee camp grog people that escaped from westruun potentially yeah i mean it's a large group of people i'm assuming they came from a city of some sort maybe we should pop them back to whitestone i feel like it might be good if we find out if they're hurting that's where we're putting our survivors oh we could rest overnight and you could pop them in in the morning are you out of all your-- oh mist form maybe we'd find pike's grandfather percy would whitestone be able to sustain this many more people all right you can't like leave them there oh so noble scanlan oh yes should we make sure they're actually innocent nice people stealth ahead can i sneak ahead and just listen to them hey like 100 yards out i just want to hear what they're saying it's pretty dark though but i do have good darkvision yeah we're in the woods right just kidding we're in the grasslands 18 there's no-- (laughter) do we see anyone that we recognize from westruun no well the guards are coming through with torches i don't want them to find us and think we're spies yeah but i don't want them to think that yeah i think you can stay 'cause you're more hidden than i am i'm going to go back to the group i feel like they're going to see me i'm so hidden shit all right all right all right just a second oh all right okay fine fine fine fine 23 holy-- (whispers) that's drez vina well should we go back to the group or tell them to come on in we have earrings (whispering) hey you guys you guys hey percy pay attention hey guess who i'm looking at right now well-- drez fucking vina drez vina was that dude that sent us on our very first mission together you guys yeah percy you weren't there yet percy you weren't there-- drez vina's the guy drez vina was the asshole hey keep it down i don't know who all can hear over these earrings see he likes us now we totally helped him well maybe not anymore the one you just mentioned do you guys want to just come on in make a nice pleasant chattering-- maybe you should sing scanlan as you approach so that people know we're nice what is it what is it hey you guys grog-- don't you remember us in westruun vox machina oh while that was happening i pulled aside his mother is this everyone that made it out of westruun but you're searching for a home cornelius is he the man i saw in the finer robes did he work in the cobalt reserve oh okay oh wonderful we're meeting cornelius he's a bookbinder vex'ahlia it's quite dangerous there right now a small older gnome there's a city a lot of the refugees from other cities that have been destroyed by the dragons are finding their way there and-- we could give you safe passage very quick safe passage there's farmland there are some empty buildings we have very safe means of travel oh possibly a bit deeper into the frostweald really yes kill some orc what does your brother look like understood (laughs) a very safe one well we've been to the frostweald before i'm not afraid to go in there again would there be any injured members of your camp that would want to head out in the morning to whitestone somebody that needs any medical attention should we scour the camp for her grandfather i know he said there were no gnomes but-- yeah right i just i don't know i wish pike were here that's wonderful and she can pop over they could go in the morning and just go find her immediately all right what the fuck are you singing what was that wow let's go find the injured yes can we find any families with children and maybe see if there's able bodies in there that we could send through yes maybe elowen could go how many sick people are there perfect i talk to elowen and ask if she can go find pike in the morning if she wants to go through and all that kind of stuff it's really fun actually you'll pop right out in whitestone it's amazing i pop trinket out and i sleep on him hugs and hugs yes yeah he farts on you all the time ey-oh what would you have seen what would you have seen we've got to walk them to the forest okay we can walk for two hours you know what i'm going to fly up i'm going to (hacking spit) and fly up and find a fucking tree i'm going to scout for a tree i didn't think about it i forgot 23 fly back down and i tell them i look along the path though and make sure it's safe the walking back is it okay i wear turquoise to blend in with the blue surroundings i do some circles around and wave i hang off of it as i come down like woo and then come back up dexterity or acrobatics damn it i said as i come down it was low i was low i grab for it and (hacking spit) as i'm grabbing for it okay okay 25 i'll bet you thought i was really falling i'm going to work on that trick you guys and it's going to be amazing we remember dear insight check he's lying 18 very few things are beyond his understanding like golems what does the circlet do scanlan what the fuck they're all sorts of different places we're trying to figure that out right now we're not exactly sure we're not exactly sure keyleth because what if he goes to find them is it morning yet can pike come join us yet tell you what master quall we're not heading there now but we'll be going back and when we do we will find your home and we will search out this circlet as well as something from your collection no we would want something as well physically do you know where they wander i give pike a hug as we walk to his tent that's pretty cool no no no lending is-- i am recovering a bit right now but thank you for the wonderful wonderful idea scanlan thank you i appreciate the vote of confidence we head into the frostweald we find the orcs and send them back and keep going and find this sphinx-y mate we just know frostweald pike of the what mountain yes you're stronger than grog now oh shit pike is so strong holy moley but we can't use it because she already used the travel through the trees but we saved all those people scanlan let's walk it is going to get cold though once we head into the frostweald we had all those fancy cloaks i had winter's cloaks for all of us before does everyone still have their winter's cloaks from a long time ago they're refugees that's really sad i constantly keep an eye out for anything in the front of us and behind us oh that's good that'll definitely not let anyone know magical people are on their way but put it on twitter so that everybody else knows what it is we should probably rest then right we'll be hitting the frostweald at night tomorrow not anymore the dragons are bunkered down i believe and i still have a little dried blood on the outside of my ear i could use a bit of rest you're really blurry percy i have no idea i want to pull my brother aside when we set up camp pike hasn't seen your beautiful mansion oh that's right-- we can do it both nights scanlan has a mansion pike i'm having a lot of talk with the servants about different ways to prepare food can i find-- is there a library in the mansion scanlan can i pull my brother into a library or something i just want to talk to you okay weirdo i couldn't help but notice anywhere pike was you were not all day today and i have a feeling it's because-- yes i do don't walk away from me please i have a feeling it's because of this raven queen situation i don't know i know that you offered yourself to her to save me and i can't put into words how much that means to me i'm worried that she took you up on the offer and i know you're worried about it too and i'm afraid that's why you're avoiding pike you're afraid she's going to see something in you but i wanted to tell you i've been looking through this book it's the best 35 gold i've ever spent maybe it was 30 gold i don't even remember anymore it was 30 it would have been worth 35 for all the things that i found in it look it's got all this information about the raven queen and i've been looking at it all the time i don't think she's as horrible as you're afraid she is can i tell you what i found it says that those that follow her must hold no pity for those who suffer and die for death is the natural end of life that's not bad bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate as the instrument of the raven queen you must punish hubris where you find it bring down those who try to cast off the chains of fate the raven queen represents death right therefore she hates those that live an immortal life she hates vampires we hate vampires they're terrible people right that's not bad watch for the cult of orcus and stamp them out whenever they arise orcus is bad if she hates him then she must not be that terrible oh and well that's understandable well we've lived half our life in the shadows you've made them your home am i right this is a time you can either let those shadows swallow you down and keep falling into a hole or you can use them to your advantage you can become a champion it's pretty fucking badass if you ask me i can smell it actually pretty terrible maybe we can get you some oils or something to put on it what i'm saying is brother i'm proud of you and i'm happy for you and i'm so so thankful for you and you don't need to be frightened this is a wonderful thing not many fucking people can say they're a champion of a fucking god all right but as someone who's seen the other side and has come back thanks to you there's no use living your life in fear i love my reckless brother as much as he hurts my heart i love you for that and don't be afraid to be that that's wonderful i love you and i walk away (laughter) the room of requirement shit i'm not even on my-- (grunt) oh that's good 30 oh wait 28 28 i need to practice with this broom yeah we have stuff to do all right fine i'll fucking practice does it help me at all to practice on this broom i start flying i clench really hard with my thighs to try to hold on to this broom oh jesus okay one okay that's not that bad damage oh it's automatic hit okay oh no that's 17 shit scanlan scanlan i'm so sorry i land i land i land and i instantly cast cure wounds on him fuck i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry pike pike help help help help oh god okay oh good that's good it's just 1d8 do i add anything 11 i hold my hand there pike can you help sorry scanlan you can blame my brother i'm going to practice a bit more you guys oh come on 16 sorry about that scanlan we should probably get a start on a walk yeah yeah save it we might come across some orcs i know right i could use some maybe you could think of the location of her mate the sphinx's mate well is it specific it's just we can see them bet you're glad you have that beard now huh keeps you warm no 25 are we in the woods 29 can we see anything around it any people any trace of tracks in the snow there's a look there's a fucking obelisk it's a tall stone thing grog (clanging) pike i'm going to hide behind a tree and watch i'm just going to keep guard getting a little closer but keeping you need to not use that dice right now we fought basilisks in the frostweald before can i hop on the broom and fly up and see if i could spot some basilisks around do i see any 26 don't look at them 22 pike she likes to get the lay of the land before she attacks we can't look at them right we remember that from before can we-- we can look at them to shoot at them and look away just don't look at them at all ah that's so annoying i can't tell how everybody's clumped they're-- just basically they're all amongst all of our friends okay can i fly down and land on a tall tree try to brace myself yeah okay okay i avert my gaze-ish i look off to the side of one but i can see it in my peripheral is that how it goes or it's like-- i hunter's mark one is that scanlan that it's next to i do the one next to scanlan-- that was my eye that's just a flashlight oh that's how i do it okay i'm going to-- that's right and i'm going to shoot it through the blazing bowstring oh i don't get regular because it's my favored terrain so i cancel it all out okay i'm at disadvantage 18 yeah plus the blazing bowstring plus an additional d10 17 17 yes 15 on the second yes i did yeah yeah on all of them (singing) there can only be one gnome that was fast (gasp) basilisk blood we need to take the basilisk blood remember that's super good ooh nice it's a bad luck night for grog rolling it's okay from here on out you're fine you should be a scorpion all the time do it pike awesome so it's the glowing one i get advantage on the attack because it's glowing i'm going to hunter's mark it i'm going to avert my gaze and roll a regular attack then since it's advantage that's 31 15 plus hunter's mark-- oh i didn't hunter's mark it matt and okay what did i say 15 18 and then do i still get regular attacks this is at disadvantage 19 18 i roar from up in the tree no i hold the broom in my hand defying gravity style i'm not flying i'm in a tree dude oh no was that all of them okay oh i roll with advantage because i'm in the forest oh my god i rolled a one twice in a fucking row i see nothing oh no what does it say didn't osysa say something about her mate wouldn't say its name and this is a symbol of ioun say knowledge in elvish a name is earned do you double those ones though because it's the dice ow nothing no i just hit my tooth marisha and we can get some and put it in my bag it keeps things good it's all you grog 25 i drop a pin in that and i tell keyleth now you can use that thing no i mean your spell keyleth fastest way to get to this point i thought you already learned it no he said just don't use that thing it's okay it's okay i can see it just use the spell and pretend that you never unlearned it that i pointed out to her see there we go we got some sure i go look at it investigation 19 no why would you do that matthew that's terrible we could heal him towards the beacon can you regrow his little arm like you regrew my brother's little nubbin of a toe oh we're terrible basilisks big lizard creatures was it just the three of you then not a large group of people can we-- oh no i feel terrible that's good that's good well it's like a two-day walk well you're more than-- actually-- he's rather smart isn't he here's the thing it's very dangerous dear and it's quite possible you might be turned into stone again no we don't want that for you either straight-up killed beheaded all options but you're more than welcome to join us for a short amount of time or you can head back to a camp that's about a day and a half away i feel like we should help him or something that would be good you've been to the base of the stormcrest mountains actually did you see something similar to this obelisk at the base of the mountain yes well we're sorry about the arm dear why don't you want to go that way have you seen orcs in this wood ooh actually we should probably take care of the orcs yes we did what do you say grog would you like to kill some orc would you like to stay here while we fight the orcs or could you walk us towards them and stay hidden then you come with us and then you stay very very hidden that was a lot of sidetracks on this particular adventure oh man she's creepy creepy as fuck 19 strength say what yes please next week is our 49th two weeks from now is our 50th may be a couple surprises in store
