merchandise i just finished organizing it you guys okay i wanted to give you guys some updates on some merch items those amazing posters they will be sent out in a week i think yes they will be sent out in a week because they're in the warehouse now ready to get shipped i've gotten a lot of messages asking where are the aprons and the reason that they're not shipped yet is because we ended up selling so many that the manufacturer didn't have enough cloth to make the aprons so then there was a backlog of that so they're done and they're about to get to the warehouse so you'll be getting your aprons in a couple weeks and then we'll start getting them so that's solid also we have these awesome necklaces also some other stuff so it's going to be a canon episode what if we all die at the live show i like how we all assumed it was going to be sam that was dead and flying above the audience wait no i thought he'll be back by then no happy birthday bb there's no cake y'all it gets you right yeah that's what happened to me that day (raspy singing) smelly cat smelly cat-- i don't fucking know yeah right that's where we have to go yes so if we have a heroes' feast that will take care of one thing and i have two chalices because we never used the one yes obviously all of us even trinket and pike oh no pike but what if vasselheim is attacked that's really creepy seriously wait no she has to prepare the heroes' feast for us before we say goodbye immune to fear and poison and advantage on wisdom checks do you guys want food now or do you want to wait until the break travis and that can regenerate how long do your inspiring speeches last yay how many did we get from that tell him we love him and that we're okay for the time being we're doing it live can i have one slice of breakfast pizza he's like hold on okay i guess we should exit the mansion and then-- above the water over to the volcano how do we do this okay so once we're there do we know exactly what we're doing and the volcano's underwater is that what the schtick is with it so it's an active volcano that we're diving into solid i don't think there's time somewhere we don't know where exactly no we don't know if she's there we don't know if she's with vecna i know at least look at this you guys we go to the shore then we climb up the volcano then we dive into the volcano but there's smoke coming out of it i thought maybe the top was coming out of the water i got it i think either percy or i you you thanks pike that's convenient yes of course is this going to be like the kraken fight are we going to be underwater fighting again you weren't there we almost fucking died because you weren't there with us scanlan i hated you at that moment scanlan if you die i'm going to be really upset i get the fuck back up again you're hercules mulligan are there spells designed to mask you yeah so people can't see us do you know of anything like that scanlan yeah because vecna's fucking watching us yeah all the fucking time yeah are we on the water what do our elven eyes see can we see the smoke that was a legolas reference in case you were wondering a perception check 20 is he pointing in a general direction i look where he's pointing can i see anything damn it i pull out a piece of gold do you know where the volcano is do you want to make some gold then can you tell me where the fucking volcano is paltry sum how much gold do you see every day i pull out another piece is this enough all i want to know is where the volcano is no yeah i'm going to look real hard we're a thousand feet up can't we spell ourselves out there we should rent a ship all right here's three more gold how about that introduction you're not the tallest yourself you know fuck it fuck it i'm not disguising him because of what he looks like fuck that of course i am i don't care that was a different reason and if your fucking dock mistress is such a bitch that she won't give us a good deal because of him then we'll find someone else i mean it's up to you but i don't think you should do it sure yeah probably be less than that but three days sure great wonderful of course and you have something to sign i'm sure percival can draw something up how much do ships normally cost 600 is very low but it was far less than this yes of course i agree but an entire ship i feel like would be more than 600 yeah so she's giving us a really good deal maybe you should amend that in the contract yeah that's fine (bling) oh it sounds elegant i have a feeling you don't believe this ship will make it back do you of course yep you strapping young lads are taking us out to the volcano the shore shanty captain santy of the shore shanty i love it only taller great how long would it take to go five miles on this fabulous ship i'm going to keep an eye on where the little guy said the volcano was and try to make sure our drunk captain is taking us to the right place you're mary ann you're professor there's no way to go any faster on this is there no way to go faster captain do you go out to this volcano often lovely oh you found it very deep is your chain long enough for your anchor to hit bottom cool oh and trinket i had him in the necklace because it was such a tiny little boat but now he's out oh wait can he swim he's good he did it before right he's an expert now after the kraken fight the red light i'm useless and percy's useless underwater i'll be just behind percival he's out he's swimming i'm equalizing really your ears wouldn't pop still oh right okay cool oh good we can't communicate you called him vex (garbled) we didn't think about fire resistance did we does anybody have any light we really need to say stuff though because no one's going to be able to understand us (laughter) scanlan don't you have dancing lights or anything (garbled) don't you have a dancing lights cantrip or some shit like that (garbled) lame can you make yourself a fire elemental and it won't damage you if you go-- or will water fuck with you yeah it might be magma coming out though yeah do that that's smart yeah man-made tunnels any dangerous creatures in the area and where are they but maybe it'll know how far away it is even though it can only-- does it work that way oh okay there you go so we need to go in the top yeah oh we can understand you no it doesn't do anything in-- it flies i can try but it flies yeah it'll just sit fuck how long did that take with no water there are tunnels here maybe we can go around the perimeter and see if we can find some sort of entrance some magical-looking entrance do you know percival what it looks like did you see it in your mind's eye through the mountain through the volcano instead of down the top like he just did solid then let's try it are they resistant to water and heat solid let's not do that just yet let's control current and see if we can fucking do it with some light this time ten hey you're smart grog so we can get through it yeah grog can punch don't you get advantage don't you get advantage because of your gauntlets let's get in quick and then cover it we go fast go in well didn't you say there was an air pocket yeah i go in after him i like how everything is like keyleth can do this can you wall it off with create wall yay which are brighter now because we're not in water that was fucking sick oh because you don't breathe oh great so any time we need a breath we just breathe okay i take a breath and i start looking for a door or any way out of this 18 (gasps) is it wide enough for all of to fit through hey there's a tunnel down there let's take it a little slow because we don't know what we're coming up to though i don't want to jump full-force into-- something like that lead the way darling let's just go in the water i follow him although percy should technically be up front because he's got light trinket is behind grog i know can you see by the light of the magma what did you see up and over let's-- yeah let's go up there can we cast locate object on the anvil don't you have something that sends a direct path to an object oh fuck were there any other pockets of water along the way does your creepy undead brain remember how long it takes before we die if we don't breathe do you remember that does your raven queen regenerate lost footsies two minutes ugh two minutes yeah all right grog are you good to run and jump over some lava (laughs) oh no okay but you were on foot if i'm on the broom then maybe it wouldn't take as long potentially okay i'm going to put trinket in the necklace do you want to get on the broom with me all right anybody scanlan (gasps) sick try breathing it oh smart we do have an extra chalice you know what i'm going to take the fancy chalice and-- as needed i pop scanlan on the broom and we fly on over i think there's something burrowing or an earthquake potentially i cast pass without a trace on all of us wow 25 trinket's in the necklace (whispers) i get my bow ready oh is it a worm a purple worm oh no there's three of them you should have just done it no trinket's in the necklace we were on the broom this is really cool oh god it's huge grog little baby bulette do we remember what its weaknesses were oh 20 does it realize that anybody but grog is there we could have potentially oh god i'm going to try to hit it with a lightning arrow what do you mean i'm going to try to hit the one that's breathing on grog but it knows you're there maybe it doesn't know i'm there plus i get a sneak attack on it because you're right next to it and i'm going to hunter's mark it (laughs) i say 25 lovely so if that was a 3rd-level lightning arrow then that means i get 3d8 lightning damage in addition to my regular damage or is it just 3d8 lightning damage wait roll the attack as normal the target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit oh and every creature within ten feet makes a dexterity saving throw okay if i cast it at 4th-level so no it's just 3rd-level wow really nine plus-- 15 it doesn't actually do my regular arrow attack damage it's just-- wow my spells are useless compared to my regular attacks 15 damage you still made your save five that's five total i'm going to try to hit it again then oh and i did hunter's mark oh so i did hunter's mark-- no oh i am never going to do spell attacks ever again they're worthless for me okay okay then i'm going to attack it with a regular-ass arrow that does more damage probably-- natural 20-- than a fucking lightning arrow okay lovely sweet that's seven 14 plus eight is 22 24 plus lightning damage 24 plus five is 29 damage with a regular arrow yes no i get two sneak attacks plus another four 29 plus four 33 no that's regular can i get on my broom i get on my broom how much are these monsters or beasts you want to move there's lava careful why would you so it's still in your blood you did actually that's right wow did it feel weird to have somebody else moving the people oh shit 19 how many i've got five here 17 yes so you're at 17 now you've got another one here right here okay i'm going to hunter's mark it and then i'm going to attack it with an arrow (old woman voice) bramble shot (old woman voice) bramble shot (normal voice) 25 oh can i do sharpshooter and do minus five to hit plus ten to attack this one is a bramble shot and it's a 25 to hit okay cool five plus eight is 13 14 15 15 plus sneak attack and lightning damage 15 19 23 25 and then 4d8 piercing damage 32 and then he has to make a strength saving throw then he succeeds i attack him again this time i'm going to try as a sharpshooter okay natural 20 and it's a bramble shot do i have to say that before too motherfucker so yeah okay cool all right right i'm going to roll all my dice and then double that then add my extra things how about that all right matt okay so 11 14 20 23 25 50 that's easy 58 60 oh plus ten because it was sharpshooter 70 i didn't add the hunter's mark damage well only extra two damage for that no i'm going to move on my broom so he doesn't know i'm there i'm going to fly to here happy birthday whoa what is that i don't think we've seen this but we haven't seen it haven't seen it up close oh grog is scary as fuck i'm sorry you're scary okay put me down just vault over it are you naked with a sword hanging from your hip he didn't shake them you just put them on down that was the shadiest roll ever if you did that in vegas they'd be like no maybe you can make it a pet no that was it the core anvil is going to float up from the magma wow very observant of you grog can we see now because of all the glow coming from-- does magma glow oh i'll use my chalice what why do you still have heroes' feast you're 12 feet tall so you're hitting the ceiling should i try flying down there with the broom i'm going to recast pass without a trace on all of us ps oh in our brains i like it are you still you scanlan just in another body it's weird that you're nine feet tall but your penis is still a cube sorry yes lead the way the allhammer was-- watch over us that was all in our heads yeah let's go how often can you re-up that jar oh god it's nasty water should we head down there did it seem like you could pass through that door you didn't try to get through it it's all right we can find a way it's just a door i am flying down with the broom does anybody else need to ride do you need to bamf your wings out or do you want to get on the broom can we reopen it bust through this shit or undo it do we have a way to cancel the seal out can i pray to pelor i'm going to pray to pelor i don't know if it makes a difference i'm going to say well we are here at a doorway i don't know if you speak to the allhammer if you know anything about this but if you have any way to help us get through this now would be the time trying to do good work here for you and all of mankind oh yeah well i'm going to take the bean out and say all that shit again with the bean in between my hands i'm going to whisper it to the bean because it's part of him that's why it was so good thanks are they glowing runes are they magical runes do they seem like they're magic you're little or you could have-- oh yeah could you have stretched to either side and he does a ninja warrior shit down the tube well that's what i mean what about a wonder woman situation where you (impacts) because you got the siege gauntlets on and you make handholds yeah sure that's what i did popped trinket out flew back up grabbed grog came back down is there a door knob or anything that looks like a seal 18 maybe you could push it check for traps would my greedy eyes know what kind of metal it is intelligence investigation (laughs) oh ten i did cast pass without a trace on all of us again a while ago i said it i even marked it off after the fight your one-inch cube suddenly grows i'm going to think in my head scanlan's the best scanlan darling you're fucking hot right now all right but i love you like you were you're always my favorite when you're just yourself i mean just part of my armor if that's not boots then it's probably just the front guards huh but i've got my broom that i just said i was on you want to hop up on this broom all right it looks awkward but stay there if you'd rather did you lose your earring because you're an angel now stop being creepy scanlan they're drawings i want to look at them too i want to fly up on my broom i was going to say it and then he said it investigation 22 i'm going to be stealthy i don't want to be noisy 32 yeah you had said 15 i'm going to go up behind percy if he fucking brings it up to a god he doesn't even realize he has it what are you fucking talking about would trinket's little feet hurt if he was on the ground well i figure i would have tried to put him out when we got in the tunnel but if his feet were hurting i would have put him back in the necklace okay i'll keep him in then how high off the ground is that relief i think you're supposed to stick your hand in it grog does it look like anything's supposed to go in the triangle does it look like a keyhole can we see how deep the hole goes i want to get close to it on my broom and look at it okay all right i back up so that i'm not in the fumes oh that's where we have to smelt the platinum do we see anything around the room that looks like it could fit in that pyramid shape you mean you'll stay like that forever you can't undo it and we can get to the smelter right now or it's beyond the crossbeams all the shit we need this is where vox machina dies because they can't figure out-- yeah to fit in those things yeah might as well yeah we switched all our gold for platinum in vasselheim can i fly up to the circle on the wall on the crossbeams does it come off we can't find anything that makes a triangle shape a pyramid shape in the room ooh maybe we have to kill them and then smelt into their faces all right how tall are they how big were they and they're made out of metal they're golems it's still for another hour thank you magic the gathering - puzzle quest (laughs) oh jeez i'll most likely kill you in the morning
