went okay well i've got to go and i got up and ran and i feel like an idiot briorities that's my thing oh there's no drink in my-- what is happening (laughs) just one it's just a ring finger but it's still a goliath huh that's me yes what i have no sunbeam arrow but i would like to dip some arrows in some holy oil at this moment in time i do have potentially an exploding holy arrow no this is a normal one and then i have a question mark as well fuck yes i do yes well no each thing takes three arrows so i can do six arrows altogether are we going to get there i want to do it right before we walk in the room matt don't do anything look don't touch is there something different and then wait of course he would oh we did we can't sleep in this-- so we split them up what if we used seeming and made one of us seem like lady briarwood yes (whispers) can i insight check her (whispers) 21 and upward should i stealth with you hey i get advantage because of the gold dress 23 him first yes trinket stays trinket follows percy he's following percy pike except for you darling that is awkward he likes it the actual cassandra well shall we shall we keep moving pike always ruins stealth (laughter) ooh mood lighting check for traps yeah perception oh yeah i should do it too hold on yeah i know right 18 for me how about wait a fucking second and let me look for footprints can i look for footprints okay i don't know which one to use i'm so nervous okay let's do this one that was a bad one i'm perceptioning oh well it's the same that is a 16 that's where the acid pits are acid briarwoods briarwoods he fucking understands signs he listens to you they got the message 21 again oh no yeah it smells like grog so avoid it okay that's not good eight nope yeah (nervous laugh) yeah-- just regular seven and trinket ate it too we're immune to poison (gasps) that's amazing he just grows a beard you have advantage on charisma you have advantage on persuasion checks that's awesome oh where did pike go god damn doors inspect it for traps can you pick it oh that's good that's better than mine but not much 23 can i do an arcana check or something to see if it's magic go tell us what's up i'm stepping a little back do you know what's on the other side a conductor that's a beautiful thing it's a conductor room how high are the ceilings should i try to shoot it when none of us are in the room that's true so can we clear out and i'll try to shoot it okay i'll do that do i add my attack to it 27 it did nothing the arkenstone definitely (laughter) can you disarm it maybe just try to get through the room some of us stay on one side some other people go through and see what happens to the first person and just go through the other door he's right there just fucking talk to him do it i touch another one touch one of the stones grog trinket this is totally going to work do we see any missing ones 21 nice is she on the other side of it is the door opening behind her goddamn it i dip my arrows in holy oil three of them we're all in the glass just do it do it you said you wanted to do it just do it oh is this your room i didn't even realize we were in your house right now how good to see you again darling oh my god we're going to die i drink my potion of flying that i took from ripley that's why the thunderwave hit us all because we're all in one giant room together do it we're backing up to where we're not in the middle of the acid preparing what okay can i hunter's mark them i'm going to attempt to yeah figured as much oh god i shoot my exploding arrow at the glass it's an exploding arrow it's something it's something i was going to shoot the exploding arrow at the glass door i did and it was 22 oh shit that would've been so good to have on them i'm sorry i know 43 grog this is on the side that they left through the door closed again does the acid go through glass can i take one of my glass vials that i have and try to get some acid and put it up on the ceiling i'm flying i took a flying potion to get out of the acid am i high enough that i can see where the pipes are coming in at so i could potentially grab hold of one of the pipes on the ceiling and try to move it i want to try to grab hold of one of those pipes and aim it toward the ceiling if i can move it i'm the weakest do i get advantage damn it get those boots of levitation get them on fly up because i just rolled a fucking zero literally a zero can i use my dagger that i have the pipe can i try to lift it i wrap my hands in cloth and then i do it yeah potentially but we destroyed them can you dimension door take pike but he's percy-sized right now oh right do it just try it go okay that's way better 13 yeah at the ceiling i keep doing it and i fly over to the other side and do the same thing i'll keep directing it shitballs we're going to die (laughs) i rolled a zero break the outside gem maybe you could hit it with a mace pike 4d6 i'm trying really hard to lift this pipe with my scrawny little arms oh no 12 for strength okay oh we have another gem hit it yeah that's a lot of energy hit it with your staff does it look like a big enough tunnel now that i can move the pipe and a bear dimension door out again yeah nine i kick it with my foot to move it out of the way i'm like chun lee my legs are so strong go on the other side so you can open up the door that leads out oh yeah you're made of jelly can you do it that's awesome okay this is the best oh four it's made of metal guys that's what he pushed push it unless it's still blocking the way because the door won't open so we have to go up and over the fucking door so that's what we have to do the glass door that is partially destroyed that won't lower we jammed the door it won't open so there's a tunnel we can go up and over i use the earring and i go vax vax please that acid is filling the room we're all dying i don't know what to do yeah up and over let's go i have the robe of infinite rope-ness i'm flying i tie him and then grog lifts him like a pulley i'm flying so i get underneath him and try and wedge him help him get into the hole oh my god i thought-- oh my god percival can we stealth i think we should because as far as they know we're dead now they don't know we got out of there yeah i'm going to cast pass without a trace on us wait can't you roll again now that i told you we were casting-- doesn't work that way nice 35 can i take some of it and rub it on some of my arrows i'm scared of all of my dice right now 18 i'm damaged a little i don't know how long i want to wait when vax is-- to sacrifice him that vasselheim accent is rubbing off on you pike i think save your spells pike i don't know stealth as much as we can and then take them out i don't know how high up can i fly is it all dark up i keep raising up i want to keep raising up so i can get a better view of what's happening are sarenrae and pelor good buddies would you know or should we get on each side 200 feet square one on each side percy what do you think marisha and can i see i raised up vax will hear me if i whisper down to everybody (whispering) vax vax (whispering) i don't know where we are acid everywhere vax please isn't there anything you can do (whispering) i would love to but i don't know where you are (whispering) please vax please isn't he supposed to not be able to get charmed i'm stalling so that everyone can walk around oh he's not here wait i'm flying up trinket's going-- sure vax looks like percy right now they know we're up to something send in the real percy i'm floating above keeping an eye (laughing) oh no this is so stupid and i'm sneaking into the dark as much as i can but i want to raise up and be where i can be above them and shoot down this is so brilliant oh god can i see i'm raised above right i'm going to stay hidden as my-- oh god-- and i'm going to dip the rest of my arrows in holy oil i float closer in the darkness up up i don't have something planned i'm just going to go i let go of my arrow and cast conjure barrage with a holy arrow at them yeah i know they're all there and it shoots a cone of arrows at them it's holy arrows all of them will be holy arrows because conjure barrage uses whatever kind of ammunition i have shot oh that's a good question conjure barrage is-- dexterity save there's a whole lot of arrows flying at you just letting you know 3d8 plus whatever the holy would be okay for each okay oh that's it i just do that 3d8 that's it nine not including the d4 two this is a problem 11 11 we're going to die all my dice every dice i don't have any dice left to roll you still look like percy i wanted to use my bonus action to hide 29 she helped him lightning bolt she's immune yeah you were there for that fight it was a long time ago silence her would be good too fall over and then chain yeah that's not a good thing maybe it's better to-- so you can hide behind it after you cast it me i'm going to shoot my storm arrow i'm going to shoot from my longbow of the sky sentinel at lord briarwood at sylas okay well percy that one didn't work that's a natural one for the first that's three arrows though the second one's good that's a 25 and the last one is a 29 okay so that is an extra 1d6 lightning damage for every attack 15 for the first one and then 15 for the second one and that was -- oh no yeah that's it and that's the first attack the second attack is another shot with a holy arrow at him again okay so 25 okay 15 for the last hit too i use my bonus action to hide again i want to hide natural 20 (cheering) oh sneak attack damage she's a rogue i like it now i can see oh shit don't say you sold your soul to a hag that's a sneak attack but this is the same as a sneak attack is she blinded but he's pretty close to dying what about-- oh sorry yeah like a radiant blast or something i know i am going to cast-- nobody's in a clump anymore they keep moving around i'm going to attack lady briarwood with just two attacks trinket's going to run next to vax okay and then i'm going to shoot her a couple times natural 20 yeah the first one was a 23 natural 20 again 17 for the first one and then what do i do just double the second 19 for the second hide instead of backing up can i go sideways okay can i go below where the steps are to hide behind the wall okay then i want to stay high and i'm going to use my bonus action to cast hunter's mark on her oh man i should have done that at the beginning but i thought i was going to hide again what a waste she's trying she's trying to fight it if only scanlan had inspired you well i thought trinket would be able to help you but you're not doing anything just set it up you could do it on this move then on the next move-- (quietly) can you inspire vax pretty close kill him i love you too your headset looks really pretty awesome i'm going to shoot him yeah with holy arrows that does not hit him come on 19 17 plus two holy damage yeah yeah 19 i'm afraid my flying potion's going to start to wear off soon so i'm going to move is there a roof on that middle compound building oh really can i land on top of the pillar yeah but i can still see-- yeah okay so he can go heal himself unless we can get him like a ketchup packet violent shot get out of her view a greater we wasted a greater he's a mist (laughing) that was the lamest thing that was way cooler than what you said how does it feel lady briarwood what about yours the lady trip her seriously she's hunter's marked is he under the thing still or did it break i float down in front of him and slap him across the face oh god you can handcuff her behind her back yeah maybe greater restoration her oh sorry cassandra that's going to suck can i see from being on the roof what's inside the building you said there's no roof to that temple i was up on top of she's inside the temple can i drop the rope down from the roof where i'm at so everybody can get up in okay i'm going to do that i don't know if you want to try the doors but i just thought we could get in i lowered the rope so you guys can start climbing up ugh can i shoot at her i want to okay i don't see it it doesn't say on the-- you can't throw 80 feet no you can't we're on the roof around it i feel like it's 120 feet oh i do that's great then 13 can i hit her again it's a bigby hand 20 was the second arrow that i shot at her can i maybe go through the piece of paper that she's reading 19 damage to her is what i rolled do we get advantage on it at all 16 another 18 points of fire damage oh okay oh no have i recovered at all to shoot again have i recovered enough to shoot at her again i know bad news are you up on top i can't give it to you can i take a potion really fast what are we trying to do i'm going to guzzle a potion and then i'm going to shoot percy's special arrow question mark at the orb then what am i supposed to do killing her what good will it do maybe she's a sacrifice at this point i had said i was going to shoot the orb all right i'm going to shoot the special arrow question mark yeah exactly 23 i don't know what i'm doing 15 oh shit no 15 should i have shot her i'm sorry i should have shot her can i still fly i'm going to pull out a fancy robe from my bag and i'm going to try to fly towards the orb misfire oh wait i took a potion i took a potion i said it on the last turn and i didn't use it i don't know how much to roll for a greater healing potion that's why i didn't do it (whispering) i'm going to die no i'm serious i'm going to die right now okay 76 i know that 11 wait 13 am i close to it can i roll for acrobatics maybe i can catch myself okay i don't know where a d20 is acrobatics liam and and i'm unconscious that's my first time i've ever been unconscious no i took out a fancy robe i was going to trap the globe all right you can kill her do it with as little blood as possible i'm dead i'm unconscious you're not going to try to heal me you're not going to heal me trinket's at the door going (sad bear noises) get me out of here oh no it might work on the roof (laughing) oh my god i'm going to die oh god okay save i've only failed one three times grog you smell terrible (chuckles weakly) no can you put it in a vial oh god don't touch the orb you want to put the two bad things together no two negatives make a positive yeah i can walk that's so far away might as well try it do we have any acid you have acid can we pour it what i'm laying on top of lady briarwood right now great magic it kills all magic can you try pouring acid on the thingy and i rolled a one right as that final i can't believe i almost died again from that damn death ray if i hadn't taken that potion right before i leapt off-- a bunch of wasted healing potions long
