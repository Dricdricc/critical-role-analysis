and par-ty is it you and gilmore making out what is it what is it no i want to see it oh my god he looks so dreamy solid rock which i haven't ever played but ivan was telling me about it and it sounds like so much fun it's so hot in here though i didn't get drunk at all a really hot dragon i remember thinking he was really cute i had a thing for general krieg i was really sad when it turned out he was-- super thick ugh when we kill it we can make armor out of him no nine oh i said i hid at the end of the episode i said i hid are you rolling your special dice (laughing) don't be a dick i can't wait that was wonderful yay (shouting) what you can make us fly oh really but i'm so far away from you ugh i'm not going to be able to get to her okay will you be able to move forward okay i'm going to send trinket up to that little alcove keep running no a little further-- a little further that's as close as he can get to you okay get him tucked into that little side okay and then i move forward so i can see him right there all right and i'm going to hunter's mark him and then i'm going to shoot my longbow of the sky sentinel at him so that i'm going to shoot an arrow and it divides into three arrows and they all turn into storm arrows so i roll an attack for each one of those for my first attack okay so the first one is a 26 should i roll damage for that one the second one is a 29 the third one is a 20 17-- 20 23 for the first arrow nine ten 11 13 17 for the second one and then 14 15 16 22 20 what is that 27 for the third okay i'm going to shoot through my blazing bowstring for my second attack yeah that was just one 25 i know it's ridiculous 16-- 16-- 19 and then an additional d10 so 19 of fire damage so 25 for the third for the fourth arrow and i rolled a 15 for stealth not that it probably matters anymore and then i stay very very still they're squares (laughter) matthew mercer you're trying to kill us no this is the one that pukes ice this is what made the dude frozen look at this cone you have yes yes freeze the other worm it does 40 points we're going to die you're going to go past the worm though shit thought i was helping you've left us stranded we're going to die pike is on the other side me and scanlan ten rounds okay can i see him can i shoot through him you can float up to the ceiling and then attack from high but half of the party is still not able to escape you're made of wind cool i know i've got to save you i know okay all right are there any stalactites coming from the ceiling okay i'm going to shoot conjure barrage at the ceiling and try to create noise away from us how about towards the ceiling above the frost worm which way could i shoot that he would not be in the way huh god i don't know i mean i'm going to move as quietly as i can around towards that little crevice just add my dexterity to it 17 okay now i want to shoot conjure barrage at the ceiling above the frost one okay that is 3d8 i guess 14 plus five what's 14 plus five 19 seven damage because of the stalactites i'm going to look over at trinket and i'm going to go-- i'm going to go like this to trinket and i'm going to shoot another arrow i can't do the same thing i'm going to shoot an arrow at the ceiling right above the frost thing and then i'm going to use my bonus action to hide okay oh god that didn't do any-- well i was hitting a stalactite which is totally still so it was 13 so just a regular d8 yep 11 and then i stealth for 21 points of stealth why would you do that why would you do that you're going to kill her she would hide i'm sorry i didn't shoot an arrow i just realized i didn't shoot an arrow at his worm and i meant to and i'm sorry the one that you're in can i do that to her just back away from it so obviously these worms don't even care about each other at all that is what i'm thinking we could get them to fight it's also what what does it say yeah right since you cast it you could break your concentration it doesn't matter it already happened so you can cancel it if you feel like canceling it some people's brothers in the room are at a really low health level right now i don't know who we're talking about but some people's brothers-- we're in the middle of a battle i dropped stalactites on them so yeah there's lots of loose rock is that the edge of a cliff over on that side got it somebody's got something of acid resistance though somebody has an item i have it hunter's marked can i feel it okay there could be other worms around can you take a healing potion in case he starts to digest you some more can you go like that and get a healing potion and (mumbled) go like that no i was further over i'm going to shoot from my blazing bowstring at the icy worm yeah i know 17 balls balls balls so i'm going to shoot-- nope not going to do that i'm going to shoot a regular old arrow at him and it doesn't do anything it goes right past him and hits the wall and he looks towards the wall oh i could have used my inspiration i should have used it on the blazing bowstring one everybody's staying can i use my bonus action to hide i do that doesn't matter then i don't do anything go pike damn you dick is it sneak attack because keyleth's standing right next to it (singing) purple worm laura & you didn't even get healed (panicked gasp) that's good so you can move a little bit an attack well he will be once he takes his damage you just killed my brother oh no it's going to get keyleth that's a huge radius get it percy i'm going to hunter's mark him and i'm going to shoot two arrows at him because what else am i going to do oh pike can help you i can't tell what happened grog went to save you 29 on the first hit and 27 on the second hit okay 20 on the first hit 18 on the second hit i'm going to stay where i am shut up (laughter) whoa that hits too grog you've never been so hot calm down grog calm your tits grog no there's gold there's lots of gold on the other side scanlan you're right there get as much gold as you can and dimension door over to the teleporter you're right by the gold get the gold and dimension door i need it yes oh my gosh get so much gold i call trinket and i tell him to get over by the teleportation circle and i'm going to run as fast as i can over to where i can see them hoarding the gold because i want to see it can i try to get some of the icy armor off of the big worm that's right next to me now i just want to pull on it and see if i can get some of it it's okay i'm more interested in gold anyway yeah we've got to get out of here yeah if we feel anything let's go okay got the gold let's go let's go teleportation circle jeez he's rolling he's rolling scanlan run oh shit slow-motion turn around is it a purple one or a blue one which is a good amount i have a feeling we almost died don't do it again not in combat dr dra right that would be smart what are we going to get-- are we doing-- wait here's a question i have do we have to give dr dra the portion of what we found down there because technically it's not in the house technically so whatever we find in the house is what we give him a percentage of yes yes right and honorably it is truthful to say that we didn't find it in the house technically it's across the fucking world they tried to steal our money scanlan and you're letting them have free rein in our house right now right we found the owner of the house and he's been frozen we should take it for ourselves just to keep it safe the house yes pike we made a deal for anything we found in the house i'm not condescending pike i am rationalizing this agreement i'm going to tell him you said that it's not evil evil it's not an evil house well exactly it's got secrets we have a house that has powerful secrets in it that people shouldn't be in i'm saying we should claim it so that we can keep other people from falling victim no we just say-- keyleth really you think that's how you would phrase it you'd say we heard rumor that the owner of the house had gone missing we went to investigate and discovered very powerful dangerous secrets within we know where he is he's frozen on the other side of a portal we need to make sure nobody else falls victim to it so we close off the house and we say we'll keep it safe for the time being we tell him we heard that somebody went missing and we were investigating where he went what we have to go through his guard no we're part of the council i think it's a very fair-- percy exactly i'm not saying it's ours i'm saying we just make sure no else comes in yes we did (laughing) that was the lamest slogan ever (laughs) lalalala i stop and i get the golden tea set and i take off after him what the fuck was that about so you're lying you're lying grog yes you are we're already out of the house maybe it was lying to you how about this how about nobody ask the skull any more questions i don't like evil things in the bag of holding we have lots of weird things in there i don't know how it'll react should we put a cloth over it oh shit that thing's alive that is definitely alive no no no there's definitely something in that stone it looked at me allura she's not here she's-- oh just one of us though can you transport items with it you get the wish grog you sure get the wish that's true or me okay i'm going to go speak to uriel and see if i can tell him what just happened you can all come with me no how about we all go together to whitestone yeah but then it'll be in whitestone no why did you run the skull out of the house i don't know maybe the skull was trapped in the house maybe it wanted to get out of the house i think we should hide it and then open it up when we're in front of allura pike grog what do you guys want to do we can't just count it right here away from your friends but back at the keep not at the moment but we will once you tell him that we're here yes but we would like to write it down first oh they must have seen him right after you saw him we heard there was a council meeting we're here because there's a council thing is everything all right uriel an old friend and discovered that it was in fact true the owner that was missing has been killed yes no i believe it was built by krieg it seems rather old this portal i have no idea incredibly dangerous it might be best if we investigate it ourselves thank you no you all look quite lovely today and we will leave you to your business i'll wait for him far away they closed the doors no but i thought i could wait in the back of the throne room out of earshot excuse me handsy i'm leaving no they fucking shut me out i start chatting up the guards on the outside of the door to distract them a little bit scanlan what are you doing here i tell some guards on the way out just to block off that house and not let anybody in it don't go inside on your life not a lot of troops just a couple of dudes is good okay jarett any issues while we were gone good man i pat him on the shoulder don't you have your sheriff badge call the council those guys they'll make it worse don't say that scanlan you've got a cube like a sister you dog then you didn't know there's no part of you that knew you had any children just make sure that she knows that you love her and make sure that she knows that you're there for her well technically it's still defined by-- you could make a really good move of it by helping her get out of the stockade trinket scanlan needs help you do a good job of it keep drinking that ale i can stay and count ooh i like it they do have a range we're useless oh okay out of sight of zed just so you know i know right 1050 (singing) knick knacks and how much in platinum (whispered) oh shit oh my god they forgot to grab their gold i like them oh i run and check the silverware no what about jarett he was supposed to be keeping an eye on them i hate your friends what about our rooms is it just the kitchen that's cleaned out or did they take everything in the keep there was shit in there anyway they don't know i shopped for everything at home goods so joke's on them we should heal up and get ready to take this to whitestone in the morning yes are you going to try to shove it in the lock it's okay scanlan is going to buy all new stuff for our kitchens oh that's okay you can give her all the gold that she needs to buy new things for the kitchen you have about a thousand gold because i gave it to you it wasn't fancy silverware it was utilitarian and other things or send somebody else if you'd rather i'll go hi oh well why yes of course i'll tell the rest of the group we were planning on heading out to whitestone today but we can put that off if it's very important all right what were you guys fighting about before can you tell me really it looked kind of serious is anybody in trouble can i insight check him 23 okay well we will be then yes if you see my brother anywhere can you send him home thank you he is so sneaky i need to train with him more i go back and tell everybody what he just told me right (laughter) i feel like your room is very secure maybe how many times can you use that little tree thing keyleth fuck yeah take the stone from his sister and come back let her know it's useless after the one use got a good idea what if you go you don't take the skull you tell allura what's going on bring her back with you through the tree she's really really smart she can go right back you can send her right back well then you come back-- it doesn't seem tampered with at all the door maybe we should make sure there's like fabric over it you're seriously the coolest guy we need to give him a raise did you find him vax well there you are what's going on i believe you fully what do you mean well that's a very deep question no (sigh) sit down seems like a problem in your mind are you mad because we're stealing gold are you mad because everybody's running off in directions and you can't keep up are you mad because you almost died right that's really all we're doing now just on a grander scale yes you are he doesn't despise you i get ready for the evening (giggles) yay wait wait wait as soon as i notice that i touch grog and vax's shoulders and i point up really fast could i tell from my favored enemy-ness that it was dragons no that was wrong 23 one black and one red can i use my primeval awareness to see if it's actually dragons close by oh my god they were red and black-- of course they were fucking dragons everything else was dragons why wouldn't it be dragons are we fighting something now oh hi dragon you're my favourite customer 14 the castle looks really badass it's just off of camera are we really fighting this right now what's happening yeah no i think we-- we brought this on ourselves jesus bad 20 20 didn't save or go inside running towards keyleth okay i don't know why we're not running inside instead of away are we running got it okay i'm going to shout out in draconic and i'm going to say raishan is that his name raishan so sorry for whatever pissed you off so bad-- your fight's with us not with this city leave the townspeople alone and i take off yeah yeah of course oh oh can i cast something can i cast something i guess i'll do hunter's mark on him i was going to do protection from poison so i might not full dash i'll hunter's mark i'll just dash i'm just stupid (gasps) what about gilmore where is he he was right next to us what happened to you percy oh god so we're totally getting in the tree i know it we're going to make it that fuck that was like the biggest dragon ever ever west east he died he died to the keep get underground i shout gilmore before i go though did this all happen because we went back to general krieg's place did we kill the entire city because we went back to general krieg's place or maybe this was a long time coming and it just happened to time up you destroyed your whole city matt this is act two of the game of the video game that you're playing someone won
