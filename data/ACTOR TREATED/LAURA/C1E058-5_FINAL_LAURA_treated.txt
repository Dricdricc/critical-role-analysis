clock we're supposed to fix oh my gosh we fixed it that was so much fun liam i'm sorry i killed you so many times wait how much time do we have left yeah let's do that bixley criticalobrien sam and i hope you guys spell his name right good job man [break] oh hey guys oh thanks for joining us sam he really did though is that the camera or is that the camera i feel like we could squeeze in would you consider taking-- question travis are you really-- in this game oh man that's so sad i don't know you can't count past six anyway that's so sweet we're what 27 are you in your 40s oh really do gnomes age differently we are too we live around to 150 don't we we probably look around 20 it was exaggerated pierce is real emma's real all of the layout of the booths is exactly right there is really gold coming out of the kitchen all the time and he started playing dnd because of critical role yeah that's right i know right the abilities i know you're so quick that's too hard it's really fun to watch but i would feel so intimidated trying to play who knows where life will take you guys i think some people would be okay with that travis on a scale of one to 22 how much do you-- oh it went away as i was reading it shit taliesin that was a while ago i want those so bad no we're going to go yeah we're going to go visit ashley and go see it's a problem which class would you have been liam had you been playing we would have been twinsie rogues again watch the shipping i favorite a lot of drawings because i love looking at art of it no we're not we did have a conversation out during the break about how hard it is to have an animal companion who is really cute and you want to protect it but you want to take advantage of the fact that you have it i know at least you could pick up bixby like back in the day when we had to walk around with trinket travis you are my favorite like we can answer that i know i know because ashley told me yeah but i knew before there was a question that i talked over wasn't there what your titty your titty ruxpin i thought it was a demon oh i saw the question what level were we when we all started the game we were all level one when we started matt was very kind to us when we first started playing people springing when we were trying to help people jumping out of wagons question does grog have any love interests (gasps) he does sam not having any time ever if anybody said that i don't know if i'd be able to handle it in a session if they did what you did pick up i'm sorry pick up pick up i would die no it's a broom damn it and here's the thing here's my thing about the alignment i was neutral good stealing a lowly little broom and i'm going to say that i did not realize because i've never played this game outside of our game that if you stole something from another player it was a bad thing no but i just thought it was funny some people say it's a no-no to steal from other players i didn't know that because he was coming on and it was funny and it was a fun thing exactly so i just thought it was funny but vex for the most part has very good intentions for everything that she does so if anything i should have dropped to just neutral or is there such a thing as chaotic good i feel like that's what i should have been but straight-up chaotic neutral i feel like was dropped two levels of alignment which i think was wrong i have talked to matt about it afterward because i feel like for where she is in her head for her to be that alignment i'm a little worked up about it you were great liam are there still tickets is it still up go check out the link man that's awesome can you show everybody your picture from prom because i just love it so much oh were they it was the first musical i ever saw seeing phantom of the opera is what made me want to be an actor once was so good sam and no hell no i would hide i wouldn't have gone out anywhere really i didn't have anything i had a dagger that's all i could do you're right being a rogue is lame we told you to do it and then we didn't even look i just saw a thing saying did we have a baby we didn't have a baby we have a dog named charlie but no babies plus we wanted matt and marisha to be here when we announce the winner they're so good i am not pregnant i don't know i pretty much agreed and you really got pulled apart when we were killing little baby liams was your brain in them oh no that makes me feel so sad i can't read this fast i like that it's stadium seating i like that it's a small theater because i'm afraid i would get so nervous if there was a lot of people scariest moment going into the kevdak fight i think we realized too late-- plus and then when we started i was like okay we've got to get to liam we've just got to get to liam and then he throws those assassins in i was not expecting that if you would have rolled a one-- at the live show oh man i know because we don't ever have any kind of romantic stuff yeah felt pretty normal it was so weird to be at the studio and know the location and actually be able to visualize what you're talking about it was so weird yeah and the brownies yeah i never feel angry ever like when we joke and we're like fuck you matt there's never any real anger towards him at all it's a joint game and it always feels like he's trying to help us that's awesome is that on youtube plus we don't necessarily know you dumped pike it went so fast now it's going so fast who would win in a fight stinky jules or percy and i am pretty damn sure percy would win stinky jules is a vicious son of a bitch all right (regular voice) i do think that her level is way lower but she was pretty fucking cool discover it as we're playing it we're working on it there was a point when we were all talking about what we were going to do in the kevdak fight where we were like can we technically do this and marisha was like hold on and she got up and walked in the other room and then came back we were on facetime with each other she was like matt says you technically can't do that that was a total joke travis plays all sorts of types when he was joking about how-- last question it better be a good one you guys why hasn't scanlan's daughter smelled the poo note and taken it out who knows she might've who asked that question yeah that one was pretty bad you would have realized it was all an illusion i think my biggest regret is that i couldn't bring vax out of his sadness that he was feeling as a sister i wasn't able to-- i couldn't bring him out like no raven queen could that made me sad poke your head up out of a pool of blood pirates
