can you see him is he there my brother i can't see you you're hiding in the shadows i can yes what you're crazy yes yes see that's exactly what i was asking travis is like in a few hours oh really is it ending tomorrow night or is it ending tonight i'm scared it's actually ending tonight he thinks it's tomorrow night but i think it might be tonight it's probably tomorrow night he's going to murder us all very shortly all these overlapping things happening and we've got our critical role logo on the back so cool they're soft they feel very nice on your body but yeah those will be up as well for a week for pre-order so yeah check those out get whatever shirts you can and i think there's a limited amount available for purchase right away so if you order fast you might be able to get them but that's a very small amount and also to everybody that's been messaging us on twitter there have been some people that have really been wanting us to expand our sizing and we are definitely working on that it's hard to find some vendors that can accommodate us but we're working on it so hopefully moving forward in the future we'll have larger sizes available to everyone critrole critrole by the way i have some of liam's dice in front of me maybe my brother should hang onto his things that's a wonderful announcement we already rested though what do you think keyleth i mean it's your family i'm rather winded actually is gern completely out of the picture have we lost sight of him you said that so weird like how what do you mean are you going to poop us a bed i know are we just going to watch you diddle yourself let's have it what is this a teleport sort of-- is it that fire plane where we just-- there's no dragons in that plane what wait could you technically do this with any refugees i mean where do they go when you make the door go away like attractive they're all hot so terrible why the fuck not and i walk on through what the fuck no wait do you pay them or do they just work for you this is terrible scanlan are you sure have you asked them your purpose do you enjoy your purpose wow do you tip them i believe you what in the fuck is this place how are you doing this so wait you built this entire castle so how do we know that you haven't installed creepy spy things into our rooms scanlan i don't trust you that is terrible it's a terrible path you're going down right now i am uncomfortable with this-- so uncomfortable right now scanlan where are we staying where's our rooms for that's really sweet it's super-duper weird it's really weird is the door protected can anybody come in or is it only if you invite them this is the best fucking mansion ever how-- i mean-- what (gasps) no but they could run away it's not like time freezes i pull out my crystal and i call upon the great power of trinket i choose you we have a mansion you built a trinket room that's okay he'll stay in kaylie's room for the time being and then-- pike loves him i bet he wouldn't mind-- do you have any rooms with very high ceilings the very front but i mean somewhere i could put a bed for myself and trinket with very high ceilings wonderful i'll move my bed down there that'll be perfect trinket needs to train all right totally i understand no we're killing cows we're killing we're killing poor servants-- that's so dark grog stop it look you're hurting it trinket blocks it no grog actually i think you should train for a little bit at least just come down to the basement and maybe train for a little bit i go down to the training room and i stop the servant and go can you bring down a bed for me thank you grog can we train please yes i think i need to train with you specifically the minute we get downstairs i start pawing into the bag of holding i just need to (grunts) (a phone dings) oh just this cleaning utensil is all are we by ourselves nobody else came down right yeah i just wanted to do some cleaning with this broom that i-- i put it in the bag of holding before maybe you can train over there on those dummies and i can just sweep up some of this sand that's around in this area right here yes well trinket actually wanted some training with his cannonball if you will stand still so he can run into you a few times that would be swell it's fun right go ahead and try trinket oh god you're really doing it yes that's the point of this to get trinket to run into you is the point his attack bonus is plus eight and you're knocked prone while all that is going on i have a broom in my hand i put it between my legs and try to sit on it and i jump in the air a little bit okay i say up fly lift up fatty arbuckle shenanigans ren and stimpy i don't know fuck grog (irish accent) fatty arbuckle (laughter) (groans) i put the broom on the ground i walk over and i punch grog as hard as i can it's not i'm pretty fucking weak sorry i hurt you grog i know that was a very strong punch are you guys good do you want to keep training nothing i put the fucking broom back in the bag of holding i figured the servants can do it i walk upstairs i go find keyleth hey actually-- no i don't want to talk to you keyleth what do you know about magical things like a lot oh fuck thank you so much scanlan i might need to talk to you dear why yes we should i go get the broom from the bag of holding again i follow him up and knock on the door wow well darling i shut the door behind me i have a favor to ask you it's nice mood setting i like it you're so smart i've always thought that about you that you're very smart yes i sit down next to him on the bed cozy help me what maybe okay scanlan i'm a terrible person i know i took a broom from a poor poor dragonborn maybe i know i'm sorry i know i'm terrible and now it won't work and it was pointless and i want it to work help me because it flies scanlan i don't know there's just something about being up there in the air that makes me feel alive in a way that i've never felt before okay wait-- oh you mean with your cube i'd rather you do it with this broom actually and not in any weird way just to be able to help me make the broom fly do you know how to do that oh no i speak elvish draconic undercommon but you saw it well i tried fatty arbuckle i thought maybe that was something coral carol what was the oh coral carol i don't remember the other one's name stimpy was it stimpy it was stimpy wait but what does the word say where's the word can i find it what is it what is it what does it say that's smart (hacking spit) (singing) something has changed within me oh my god oh my god scanlan i hug him i hug him as hard as i've ever hugged scanlan i love you so much you're my favorite person in the entire universe right now i owe you-- i love you i sit on it how high are the ceilings in here can i sit side-saddle on it (hacking spit) i don't remember how i said it before why didn't i choose something more fun to say yay this is awesome i'm really high oh my gosh can i take my hands off oh my god i probably should have been lower to the ground when i said that okay that's fine oh i'm still exhausted 20 can i point it down towards the ground and get lower oh my god this is the best day of my entire life thank you thank you oh i know i know it's terrible how bad of a person am i i'm a horrible person well i tried i was going to give him a lot of dragon scales and he wandered away well how do i help him because i feel terrible i will help as many people as i can while i'm flying through the air i think that's a deal scanlan what are you like a hag now i sit on it and i open the door and i fly through the doorway i'm so happy it's the best i'm going to try to sleep it's going to be really really hard because i'm so excited but i really need to get some rest (whispering) it's the green one i come skipping into the room for sure what a beautiful day it is oh that is so sad can you heal it can it be healed wait scanlan can we store things here or does it all disappear as soon as we leave we should leave something inconsequential no no no no let's not thank you scanlan for making me feel so guess what i can fly a-plus did you have a weird night do you want to tell us about it okay so i sort of kind of tricked gern i'm a terrible person i sort of kind of this is the worst took something that wasn't mine in a way i mean i was holding on to it and then i slipped and it fell into the bag of holding i stole from a necromancer yes no he was a nice guy we did we took it scanlan and we didn't tell allura we're terrible i know i know i'm afraid these rogue tendencies i've been learning from you brother maybe rubbed off a little bit no i just i know i shouldn't have i wanted to return it right away and then he wandered off that's a lie i didn't want to return it but i did want to pay him no i did i did i wanted to pay him but he wandered away and then i didn't pay him and now i have this broom that i stole and there's really no way to return it well i probably could find him but i don't want to because now i can fly you guys no i'm going to keep it actually percy do you know-- i know you can build things and make things wonderful i pull out the broom and i lift up in the air no i've been practicing i've been practicing no no no look i'm not holding on percy look at me not holding on okay shut up 13 oh man disadvantage okay 16 oh shit oh god okay okay shit balls 13 mother bitch i really need to work on this okay yes percy this is the thing can you build a seat on this what if you could build a seat and then i can sit on it instead of trying to sit on this tiny little stick really how's that mimosa treating you oh no are you already drunk keyleth i float down i float down eye-level but i'm still floating why are you trying to be an asshole here's the thing keyleth i'm not afraid to die anymore i came to this realization i've seen the other side i've come to terms with it it's pretty wonderful that's right i'm not going to steal anything while i'm riding on it i'll practice as much as i can and percy's going to help me so i can be stable on this thing i will give you all the money you want maybe but i feel so good i start eating while sitting on the broom where should we head to did you want to head back to-- actually keyleth you said something weird happened last night for you as well yeah i look at my brother all right cool keep going that's one of the dragons what do you mean they adopted a dragon how so she was making it seem like she was 15 oh eventually right totally that day the day okay well that's good to know got it do you guys have vegetables maybe any vegetables cool chicken and mimosas it's my favorite breakfast little where are we going next you guys we need to talk to a sphinx a sphinx's boyfriend that's with your tribe so do you want to go now or do you want to maybe swing by somewhere we'll remember well it's all actually around westruun right aren't your people around westruun so we have to find them last time we ran into them wasn't it on the way to kraghammer i think it was the frostweald is-- south of westruun yes potentially well grog would know cool yes i think grog really wants to go yeah around there okay oh weren't you-- and oh the hat of disguise very big the wolf oh the wolf in whitestone well trinket can smell six okay oh i hold up mine too how many hands is that steal from the goliaths that could work does he wear them all the time does he put them in a chest yeah you're right if six is the right number as a hat no he has locations of other vestiges i feel like pike would want to come with us grog you're very dear to her you know of trees outside of westruun and gatshadow is where grog got his scar right allura i think handled that right you saw her yes we have been to the frostweald frostweald is where grog mugged down with the nymph right allegedly yes you do let's do it i mean we could try westruun's under dragon rule there's an actual dragon on westruun let's do it let's do it let's do it yeah oh shit go to the forest no this is great ugh no we are we're super fast i pop trinket back into his little crystal percy what if instead of a seat what if it was like i was straddling it and there were two little things like footholds no no it's up to you it's totally you i was just coming up with ideas to help you out no no it's all you it's all you can we mist down a little closer to get a better view of what it is wow no 16 for me oh this is where they make their offerings that's good to know i have advantage on anything having to do with dragons it's good to know that that's there though yeah perception 31 they've imprisoned the people we can't talk to each other i don't know what good we'll do right now i mean how many guards are there around there what do you want to do what do you want i noticed it too oh shit can we stealth as we come out of it i want to cast pass without a trace immediately can we go down in an area that there's shadow to where we're hidden somewhere that when we take form we'll be hidden i don't know and i cast pass without a trace so it's extra ten 32 add ten 32 we just want to sit here for a minute and talk about it can we just say so here's the thing those guards are attacking the farmers i'm pretty sure they're using slave labor at this point kind of like you scanlan slave labor to provide food for the city vax really wanted to stop down but the thing is if we kill the guards and set the farmers free everybody in the city might starve it's a tough situation right now i'm afraid right now i don't know what all we can do in this town until we can defeat the dragon which unfortunately is rather close i mean we can tell him to hold out hope he could also be one of the assholes that's serving the dragon just like people in emon act natural keep picking hey you do you like the dragon or do you not like the dragon do you like the dragon or do you not like the dragon good what's the worst right so you have to provide food for everybody living in the city is that how that goes well here's the thing we're trying to help you we're trying to find a way to (clicking) (choking) kill the fucks you get me ill-kay the agons-dray act natural keep picking keep picking keep picking we want to help you we really really really want to help you oh shit the guards they're keeping your daughter keep your voice down they the guards the people that serve the dragon to keep him working there's a dragon farmer what's your name reginald reginald we want to help how often do you see the dragon flying around once every couple days when was the last time you saw him (gasps) what do they look like shit scanlan green and a black i feel like we have to help them we have to help them i'm keeping an eye out for the guard i want to keep an eye out for the guard make sure he's not noticing 17 well i saw him on the other side of the thingie i have an idea can i give my idea what if we ask reginald to call for help like he needs this fuck's help and then he comes over and then we spring a trap on him i can use hide in plain sight on us and hide us and make us look like we're part of the crops to set an ambush the other guard yeah can i take a minute to camouflage us and then tell reginald to call him over got it reginald act like you're still picking and act like you hurt your ankle and call for help from that guard over there we'll protect you just step back and call for help the minute he's in the high crops so he's out of visual from the other guard shit mother bitch that's a bit obvious okay i was picturing all the plants suddenly losing their shit festivities and we gained another plus ten so now we have plus 20 to all of our stealth by the way from that hide in plain sight we have pass without a trace which adds plus ten hide in plain sight adds plus ten that's what i camouflaged us fucking for 46 (whispering) i notch an arrow grog oh shit good job there what the fuck is that sword grog what is your sword doing it takes in the blood grog the little dude your little friend you killed him on purpose you wanted to could we wait until nightfall well as soon as we move we won't be camouflaged in this crop anymore we'll lose that keyleth can you use your powers to suck him into the ground so that nobody sees him i use my abilities and try to camouflage the body so that nobody finds him reggie the other guard yeah right now they can't hurt us when we're mist see what we see can we stealth while we're misting let's try that so we can spy on the city get closer in why at least if we go in grog we can see what we're up against it's not cowardly grog it's safe all right all right can we stealthily head towards a pocket of people do we see a crowd of people being held this is my mist form stealth checks yes 39 and the spikes are facing inward towards the city or outward can we see wilhand anywhere what about the mayor's house where we heard horace-- can we see kevdak anywhere i look for a bigger goliath than the rest or one that looks older and bigger 16 we don't see a cluster of prisoners anywhere out in the open yeah do we see a cluster a cluster of prisoners out in the open at all or is it just out around-- can we say go back to the-- yeah let's go back 39 no ooh is it reggie no ugh that's us totally boring you know not a lot to see there there's a lot of goliaths and a lot of other bad guys walking around oppressing very nice-looking people it looks like if we barged in straight in they'd probably have very good fortifications they really want to look scary so here's the thing do we barge in totally risk our lives or try to find a way around this situation it's where the mayor lived before yeah it's like a big house taliesin and i wonder if kevdak goes to the sacrificial area where they leave the hoard for the dragon as long as someone is or is it a walk in and try to challenge him no you're not going to fall grog we wait you want to go in there with pike we wait for pike we wait until gilmore's up and standing and we bring pike here with us for what they never met her is reginald still around hi reggie so we're going to help you you might have to wait a little while we most definitely are spread the word that hope is alive we will find a way to beat this don't tell anyone what you saw here though right that's a good answer man grog i like it i want pike here too you could totally have taken them seems appropriate good call she's little
