marisha's dead we don't know where taliesin is we would be doing so well if taliesin was here he would totally know what to do right now we got to go to the twitch stage oh yeah the back area let's make our way to the twitch area what the heck is happening i want to know where it's going yeah there's plenty at the side-- i bumped into you right i marked that down oh she gave us a-- a foam sword no she gave us the wooden-- taliesin and she was being so kind stealthily we don't want to make noise past the meat mass hello no through the hallway i feel like the nerdist office-- i just feel like it's going to be here and avoid the server room i'm sure there's something heavy that i can grab and use as a weapon in the nerdist office is it just perception oh god i rolled a failure on the red this is the only one did i see anything nothing yeah but-- do you know how you get pink eye i'm just playing with the pink eye system i'm playing resident evil yeah oh my god the farmer jumped out oh you guys have you played this oh my god you guys i already took it off dick and you're in the kitchen i'm crazy hey guys thanks for leaving me behind in the nerdist-- well your funeral is obviously referring to if you go through the curtain you're dead i was born in a box how do i end oh and it's got-- how do i end i was born in a box how do i end you end from the sun so i'm going to stand in the sun sam and oh maybe the cross too a wooden stake situation can't you die from a cross if you're a vampire aren't we vampires look at my teeth we did coffins dude no we were born in a box okay i take the wooden stake and stab the heart on the ground should i leave it here or should i back up what should i do should i leave it on the ground or should i-- i'll leave the stake on the ground very cohesive it killed the heart travis and are there any more clues around do we see any more writing let's see if the key card opens the prop closet did it work (gasps) is there a weapon in here can we look for rats i need a rat i want to eat a rat again it was really good i'm serious three successes for me three successes i'll do a dex brawl just one success can i share it with sam though i have to eat the rat all myself okay i eat the rat just one i tried i wanted to but it's such a little rat (slurps) (gasping) you're going to suck arcade's blood you got two fails yo he's giving in to it (gasps) you can't get rid of your other one i'm looking for a weapon in the prop closet with the rats what were you going to say sam but we'll also make sure-- we'll make sure travis is okay i mean he's a pretty fast runner i'm probably the slowest out of all of us i got two tens how many stakes i stick that in my belt like i would at a ren faire yeah did i find a world of warcraft weapon too whoa is it made of metal this is way too heavy for me two yeah what was it look at this big-ass sword i found do you want to switch me i'll take the dagger and you take the giant sword okay all right this is really badass oh shit i forgot we were trying to solve a puzzle wait marisha died by mushrooms he probably still has some on his skin silver do we have any silver oh shit i did i had silver chalice written down i thought i could drink out of it well you could hit it silver is bad for vamp-- does this hurt to hold yeah it's right over in the corner over there dude i'm going to go in the back offices i'll be at the back all by myself you want to go to check out the back offices with me holy crap erika i'm already in the back office i don't like it oh god we haven't even seen ivan yet he's not feeling it yet what happens if you get five hungers i'm going to go back in the back office i'm going to use my obfuscate that's right so i can be totally sneaky okay what does that mean i get another blood two i get two extra-- i'm so hungry all of a sudden past where we filmed the slayers' cake thing through to-- i'm looking for writing any clues i can find there's nobody in here do they smell good does ivan smell good whose back is to me as i'm coming around the corner i'm assuming they don't see me because i'm-- ivan into the back corner and ivan seems completely unfazed by it but everybody else is creeped out can i sneak around the room so i'm behind ivan am i going to die i just do it oh wait no wits and stealth oh i should have done that earlier do i have to use my two news i do i have to roll three reds on this shut your fucking face stealth and wits okay hold on (counting) okay i got to choose my right dice here okay here we go oh my god liam and but i got a success it was already three and just because i did obfuscate it seems a little fucked up that i have to use my new hungers on my power you didn't have to do that you didn't have to do that i'm just saying it's bullshit yeah well-- i'm really fucking hungry do they see me yet did it seem like amy was a vampire before she shattered can i-- i'm going to walk up behind damion and bite the shit out of his neck okay i figured that's what i just rolled and it was not good (whispering) i want to suck his blood a good amount of it not all of it i'm going to leave him twitching success one success yeah he didn't so i get to suck his blood at least that's something maybe i'm part of ivan's game he had a lot of blood you smell like taliesin where's taliesin i get five dodge it's four one success sam and i don't even know what that means and for each willpower i reroll a dice okay i'll try it because you're saying to do it two more successes strength plus two (chomping sounds) ooh well no no failures but one success well he's sitting right there no i'm good i'm going to let him live i'm going to push him forward against the table and back off really quickly yeah so he doesn't lunge at me as i back up like he can't walk in the darkness like i'm walking whoops what ivan hi you too man this looked like a pretty crazy game you're playing yeah i remember paranoia with you no you know what i think i'm good do you know what the deal is with that circle out by the twitch door is you have how long has it been i just thought we're on the same side here no it didn't seem like it was possible to win travis learned this lesson before i kind of want to pull a card i will sit down if you answer a question as i sit down and then i'll pull a card okay i sit down this is a stupid idea marisha sat down and had some tea she died i don't know i wasn't there i just know that she drank tea and then she turned into a mushroom how come we were put in coffins and turned into vampires and some people are delicious yeah it seems like it right yeah just waiting for the door to open to the twitch stage well we're doing pretty good pretty good looking for clues i will answer that if you make sure i pull a good card beneficial card for me not for you oh shit i turned into a vampire you're some weird electric thing that's fun (laughter) i know yeah i did yell for him travis about that loud i know but i don't know how quiet it is in the building travis i just feel like he's really going to want to pull a card and i don't know if he should i feel like maybe if this is a bad thing then we'll-- this will be just me and then they will never know yeah (yells) is this one of those magician tricks where you're telling me to pull a certain one and i don't realise it oh no i just got rid of these things shit ugh yeah dude it was how do i solve the-- hmm what coincides with the picture of the head on the puzzle am i still bleeding from my fingertips creepily all things considered though this isn't as bad as the spider or the shattering body i'm holding my hands up so i stop bleeding i hate paper cuts yeah that we know that we're vampires basically i think i'm okay ivan he's made of electricity now baby i pulled a card yeah okay but you didn't see what happened with the other cards there was a giant-- amy rotated like she was made of glass and then shattered like gone and sam got eaten by a giant spider i'm so hungry can i get up you just hid in the bathroom the whole time what i can't i can try (straining) i can't stand up i'm so hungry sam you want to come play this card game i did i learned something about the thing did we see max yet that's a long walk you have a power whoa max come sit down yeah can i get up i get up oh okay max can pull one then max what happened how long has it been it's been a whole week do people in the outside world know what's happening that's true you should do it yeah you'll be able to solve it what'd you get what'd you get three bloods you have three bloods already oh no you've maxed out your hunger (gasps) you killed max sam you killed max i'm going to take my dagger and try to stab ivan while he's distracted with all of that i'm going to try to stab ivan he would have let you die he wouldn't let you leave you would have been stuck here forever dex plus melee melee not brawl oh really that's so dumb i didn't know that's what it meant obfuscate unseen presence i could have done it before he realized what i was doing cool what strength plus melee that's definitely why i'm doing it sam ooh three successes and a crit well just one ten not technically a crit but all three were successes god that's so many dice oh shit well you just seemed like you were probably kind of mean i don't know what's going on ivan i'm sorry yeah well at least maybe sam ask your question i mean i'm just saying the game is still going on i totally interrupted the game you know we should just-- i just try to hold him on to the chair i'm just going to keep holding on yeah no i'm trying to let you go but i'm definitely trying to keep him in the chair i'm trying to let it-- you're not coming off of it (whispering) ask your question quick doesn't he have to take a hunger dice for it i know i'm sorry i'm really bad you just got to kill someone in order to-- what do you need to know we found that in order for the head to be unlocked we have to put something on it that proves we know we're vampires we don't know that one yet does it hurt it doesn't look like you're in a lot of pain i can't tell yeah sorry ivan what are you what's upstairs i'm going to pull my dagger out of him i guess okay yeah come in you got it sorry about the stabbing ditto quickly did i see anything cool on the bookshelves i didn't four successes five successes ooh get that cross five i climb the shelves to get up to it take the cross smart he knows all these vampire things because he watches werewolf movies and vampires attack them no he's into it he's scared of ghosts what does it have in it hey i bet this is a thing skull book does it tell me how to be a vampire do i learn anything cool about myself yeah i want to peruse it wits and linguistics i shouldn't have said it was cocked i'm at three hunger i really need some food you had to drink all of max's blood i'm so hungry oh god i'm down three so i'm minus one on academics i'm so hungry i found a book i don't know i'm so hungry does it sound like people i could eat what like i gave it to you and the book i'm going to put on the head i wander out into the kitchen looking for somebody to eat i listen real hard do i hear anybody i forgot i had that ooh that's good oh yeah four successes i'm going to quietly walk up the stairs i think it's a rat i need some food i don't know where any food is around here should we use the book on the other one or i could bust out one of my fangs are you judging me now have you not had any rats yet you've had a rat no of course not okay cool yeah we should try the book he said it's cerebral the book is a cerebral thing see i feel like i should eat before we go in there what if there's something bad in there what one rat's going to feed us all why are you doing this to me baby don't you love me thanks sam we walk upstairs quietly stealthily i'm not going to use my full unseen presence but i'm going to obfuscate any d10 six (whispering) do they smell good wait (quietly) hello is anybody up here hi i don't know what's going on i woke up there's scary things everywhere can we hide in here with you performance shut up you're a dick see there's so much risk every time i'm rolling my hunger dice i don't like rolling for anything now god dang it five successes one red fail but a lot of success hi i crawl under the desk are they under separate desks oh this is sam i huddle up next to the girl and act like i'm really scared and i bite her damn it so anyway you guys work at smart girls and then i bite her three successes one red fail i'm going to hold her down well i've got three hunger so a lot three oh god i killed someone take a hunger dice don't tell anyone i killed this chick oh man i feel so much better this is so dark oh no travis are you still hungry from where we should get in the twitch stage we should go in oh my god rachel rachel turned into a werewolf travis they are going to kill us we're vampires werewolves hate vampires you've seen enough of those movies yeah i'm going to run into the twitch room you have the best three successes triple sixes creepy oh no what'd you do it's totally ed and rachel muscle your way through the door much better don't you have to roll every time you use it so you risk getting another hunger dice where's willpower oh okay so i have three willpowers okay success success four successes yeah of course i'm going to make sure you're okay this doesn't make any sense but so much sense at the same time i will protect you so you can protect me okay that's how it always is liam said i need to protect him so he can protect me but the thing is you're back so you can protect all of us we should block the door so that rachel and ed can't get in here yeah dude did you see the tattoos while they're doing this i'm going to push one of the heavy things in front of the door what does that mean because he wants to survive man we're inside the twitch stages we're like right here i am going to obfuscate oh crazy are we like out there how fucking creepy would it be if we walked out i'm going to stay away from them so that i can be sneaky i'm going to go well there's really only one way around i'm going to go around this back way around that other stage so that when they come up this way-- oh shit oh god like around the other side of the stage like they're hidden that's cocked unfortunately one success yeah i couldn't tell it sounded like the crew was making creepy noises can i look for my dice bag my giant one that's as big as a head so i can roll like dice on the ground if i need to like it's going to explode if i touch it or i can take it not usually is it close by my bag that i need i'm going to take my bag i said i took it well i got my dice and i was going to go around but i can come up this way you're making sure nobody's going to jump out at you this set oh my god taliesin's inside are you inside this set
