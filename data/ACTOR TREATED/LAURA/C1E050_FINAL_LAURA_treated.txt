that is correct it'll be going up very soon do it now he just said it yeah they did she's actually shot all of our photos from the very beginning she's freaking amazing we're all wearing our shirts so what does that mean ashley it's alternative apparel and it's super-duper-super-duper cozy inside you could use it as a pillow you could use it as a hoodie dinner you could wear it to dinner just a few packages i'm sure they're really thrilled about that it is masterworks well i want that bow (laughs) he healed us all up before we left right yeah what time is it it's mid-day so maybe we should hang out in the mouth of the cave and take a short rest yes maybe we should take a long rest unless i was healed and i don't remember being healed i'm at 11 health points so i'm feeling a little sore he healed me back to my age did you get aged i was and he healed me he's really fucking old right now look at all those wrinkles his ears are starting to droop are you sure you want to do it pike are you sure shorty rest and then we'll walk i mean i could roll my own hit dice who you talking to grog yeah sure yeah i did i think i did take quite a bit of chicken aw the chicken we can't take it that's okay i've got boar meat do you want to feed your stomach the boar meat i'll mark it down to half the boar meat is gone now you guys well he's a big guy that's right well you have to roll again no joke though we all run out i slap him across the face oh yeah 19 can you greater restoration him don't break it what do you mean his soul could be inside of it how can he be how can he be dead he wouldn't know anything about these-- can we go back in what about going back to kamal no but he's right inside the cave what if he knows things the sphinx me and scanlan go back into the cave and search for kamal again me and scanlan take flight and we go back in and we try to find kamal again shit has it been a minute he just did it it just happened we just ran over oh my god is that stupid (laughs anxiously) okay okay then i reach into the bag of holding and i get out grog's cask of ale okay i pour a little in his mouth just a little bit so he doesn't choke i turn his head so he doesn't drown in it this is so stressful 16 he's taking a picture i know yeah it's either really good or really bad matthew oh my god what the fuck is that sword grog what how come he's getting a whisper and you're not getting a whisper hey you guys (sobbing) check out those how do you want to do this hoodies-- (laughter) oh my god you came back and grog died grog you died yes you did pike saved you pike brought you back shit can we see what's going on i run over and i block it i stand next to percy and i block the sword percy gave it to you grog the sword pulled you into it you were dead your soul was with whatever the fuck is in there now pike saved you nobody should touch the sword percy i feel like it's going to try and suck anybody in right now no can we talk to it i mean can we see what it is the shadow's not there anymore i mean what did it sound like four out of seven he has a third testicle it's out there i said it horses don't try to steal your soul grog oh it was lord briarwood maybe some bone knuckles i hear those are pretty badass giant's bone no how about we just wrap it in fabric no but i do think that whatever it is might know something do not use it against kevdak you don't want something making your strength unnatural when you fight your new foe you'll chop off your own leg-- he's got a vestige he's still just him that's right no there's a little left in the cask here here's your cask the dread emperor that we already killed no somebody could use it no how about you throw it in that pocket dimension and then we can always go to that same pocket dimension and get it if we decide it's bad there drop it in a thorny patch do you have any more 5th-level oh you do why not try it before we send it you're at-- okay bam shebang what do you think greater restoration will do i'm afraid it will make whatever's in the sword come out but if it comes out then we can banish it or kill it and-- it will be just a useless sword at that point fucking try it pike oh that's good what just happened drop the sword eat it craven edge well fingers crossed nobody gets it we can just fucking hang out for a day she's out of spells yeah he's got so many weapons ooh that's good yeah but this one gives her fire resistance does she have to-- in the levitation boots can you move we could tie her onto the broom we could tie her onto the broom we just short-rested but now we're going to sleep it's been a traumatic five minutes oh in the mansion fuck we'll sleep in the mansion --that we have that triple the wrinkles triple the nuts you want to work on it or you want to fly around can i stand next to you while you work on it would that bother you oh percy i just want to see what you're doing by like two whole minutes yes i pop trinket out of course so he can hang out shake it out run around get some exercise i feel like an asshole for keeping you in this thing sure percy i feel safer already i would love that what it had done to you can i see can we see it why come on yay i float on my broom and keep an eye out in front for any sort of problems shh yes i'm leading would you have kept it if you had known all those other things or would you have wanted to use more of it oh shit do any of our people have identify don't act like you know for sure (laughter) 26 oh did you want to look for that lake or are you good grog doesn't it lead into the fey world the plane in the fey world we should probably but i do want to come back here oh let's go to westruun oh shit (laughter) aw because you saw it what if i'm on the broom though no we're coming back soon because we're going into the feywild i think keyleth wants a reward where'd he find the wood i thought there were no trees around pretty traumatizing i would assume yes if all goes well you may be able-- no i don't know it may be a while but we're trying was there anything else you wanted to do keyleth all right okay what are we what's our plan here grog what do you think grog what do you want to do walk right into town a rematch i would think but they think you're dead as smart as you well he's in the mayor's-- yeah but if the city if the rest of them don't see him defeating kevdak then it's worthless they need to watch it happen but what's to keep grog safe in the meantime i don't want to abandon grog to a fight with kevdak while we're freeing villagers no offense to them i want to have grog's back what if we stay hidden yeah which you kind of did grog so wait we stay hidden and you call lightning warhammer you gained the ability to grow a beard in the afterlife it's pretty major kill kevdak it's a pride issue grog would you engage in a fight with a magical being who wronged you if you thought you were better than him nice beret there scanlan that's right he's full of shit and if we remove all of the villagers it'll definitely gain the attention of the dragons yeah what if we do the same thing that those orcs did when you go in and cause a distraction and lead them out we spend the few days that we're waiting for the dragons to build a massive trench you can use move earth and lead them all out over something and drop a herd of goliaths drop them into a trench they're stuck in there while he fights kevdak can we aid you this isn't like the crucible smart sure we're keeping a good distance as we get closer so it lasts i cast pass without a trace on us add ten because i cast pass without a trace that's really good plus ten yeah because i cast pass without a trace on us 33 32 was his name frederick no it was with an 'r' oh that you killed i rolled a better stealth than him though oh that's so much better no it's good 30 they're going to see he's missing i can fashion something reginald we're so sorry we will rescue your daughter oh shit it's coming tomorrow that means tomorrow it's coming back is that it or one more which is actually worse we need to put something back up i don't want anyone else to get hurt grog i agree don't pass it over she's full-on reading it oh i want to know what it says so fucking bad the cube over and over and over again we're still outside that's one less fuck we have to worry about it's possible i have a feeling they're having a hard time finding any sort of hoard to offer after this many days fuck yes it's possible if grog can take control of the herd they may be able to fight with us but i wouldn't trust them we need to tell the others well dragon came not happy you'll be glad to know however that it took one of your herd away with it yes that's what i think as well yes not much what are you going to do when a dragon comes and takes someone away stand there and watch really they may not be very happy with the dragon right now they may not care at all so we start today yes while grog shits i'm just going to take a little nap while he's shitting it takes a while usually right something to recover a little bit of time i'll be right back oh no blocked don't say that at least it gets them out of commission yeah good i like it if he brought his father back to fight underneath him wow he had an intelligence of four so this is only your fake father walking up at this point yes we're going to kill kevdak he's going to kill kevdak that's true i could be hiding behind you and drag you you could be a fucking triceratops again for all-- oh my god that's amazing oh my gosh a floating severed head yeah but you can make the illusion of a head talking the head is so perfect the head be a head be a giant floating severed head i like it me i mean i can use the tether and tie you to the broom do it come on scanlan i'm standing nearby on my broom i'll fly in and pick him up he can dimension door out though very quickly it's okay yes laura and fuck yeah can you dig a hole under and we can hang out in a hole with something over top of it so we can bust up out like shallow ground but we have to be able to get out of it okay and then we go in we stay at the very edge stealthed as fuck i already did ten what time is it it saw you you're invisible no no no no no oh he's out of range shit he's out of two miles' range it's a 15-minute walk though you're a fast walker for a gnome oh again
