machina logo bag but it looks like it's from gilmore's glorious goods i have never sounded nerdier in my entire life and i love it sam yours is a total troll dice you specifically asked for-- yeah you were like i want people to not be able to read it so his is sparkly with purple on pink it's really hard to read mine is really beautiful because it's inspired by my white dragon armor yeah and the 20s have our little icon on the 20 and he's got the de rolo family crest i know what a loser there's the segue online right now they're in the store right now i know in the store right now yeah this is coming out this week and then we've got more merch coming out for the holidays so you know keep your eye on the shop you don't have to i'll be announcing it you don't have to yeah i have enough for all of us to take you are so fancy i don't even have a portal gun and he's got two guns what really it might work it's hot in here so my cake is melting yeah we can totally eat it at the break so we're playing as our characters playing a game so all we have to do is outsmart grog you're like fallout glamor yeah i've got some really good songs but i don't have all my songs yeah it's fine i've got plenty of time yes at supanova come see i found it just a little hungry you're sup-- oh oh maybe you guys should i sneak ahead should i obfuscate ahead obfuscate no you just took one out does that mean he's like an old vampire like he's been a vampire a really long time it was so good yeah we don't know that they're all dead we just know the twitch studio has exploded for all we know the rest of legendary is still there fuck no i have to remember yeah i have to remember what is-- no don't throw things do we hear any sounds coming from the tunnel no our only choice is to travel underground i want to we can see i think that's a really good idea liam you should stay here and be safe do it go so fast or i could sneak down because people can't see me if i do it well okay i'm going to do that he's not going to go fast i'm going to sneak in i'll go caw caw the red two i get hungrier but i can do it okay okay i got hungrier so i've got to put my fangs back in you guys does it feel stable what does it smell like oh so i can see i'm going to lick the algae just like a little lick not like a big big lick hmm not like rat droppings i know i am shut up i keep going forward it keeps going oh okay wait i go back to them follow behind me but not right behind me just you know whatever like 50 feet behind me is that far yeah and then unless i make noise like a scream or something then you know it's safe you can keep coming forward yeah i'm so tough yep and i go back to where i was and keep walking holy shit it's like catacombs is this serious this is serious yeah you are really creepy looking i can choose okay guys it intersects with the sewer there's got to be so many rats in the sewer here's the thing y'all rats are super good they're like so fucking good sofa king delicious but here's the thing this tunnel intersects with the sewer we can either continue through this tunnel and try to figure out i don't know why we're vampires and see if there's some source to this power or we go to the sewer and we live yeah we can hide out in the sewers under la look wait we're fucked we're vampires there's probably other things that are scary true technically i did too but it's not important it's just a chick it's just this chick up in the smart girls no i didn't know her remember we were there fucking together look travis not all of us have willpower like you i get really hungry and if i don't eat i get really angry here's the thing we could record at night after a few days with these teeth i think i'll get used to talking with them i know but i don't do very many of them really you think so thanks about what i mean we can go we can keep looking we might die that's true you can't swim at the beach and stuff you know in one of the games i did where i was a vampire vampires are allergic to water yeah i don't know if that's true or not oh is there water in the sewer i'm going to wind over and put my hand in it and let-- did it hurt though okay then i don't think we're allergic to water so what do you think do you want to go to the tunnels some more you want to stay a vampire aw you didn't feel anything should we go to the path but don't forget this is where the tunnel continues on from where geek and sundry was okay gross can i try to get a rat because i'm really good at it now i rolled two successes yay can i try to catch one for travis is it dex brawl again whoa critical success oh but i got a one on one of my red i can make rat hamburgers i'm less hungry i can take my teeth out never mind they won't come out i'm stuck like this let's go to the sanctuary i will oh shit two successes one fail really that's really far well but no-- oh that's a five i look up yeah forward or back what is it a lizard like a person lizard (gasping) oh my god what is it can we eat it oh oh shit stay back liam it's too dangerous how long have you been here they're the lizard people of los angeles how can we not be vampires anymore ish we don't know anything yeah but what about this just kidding yeah can you help us are they going to kill us i don't know yes like me we'll see yeah let's do it before we release you pinky swear that you're going to

let's release him for sure i know can we cut that cake oh yeah i was thinking of the restaurant we love that place it's so good what that's creepy damn this is big which direction did we enter from jeez louise that's big and intricate what is his name lock what is lock doing right now this is still underground are you going to come in with us is it scary because he's big and strong so travis goes first then but you know what mine is four as well liam you stay back you have to be safe does it look like it was all done at the same time or has it been added over time so it's like a surgical theater oh that's good you got a critical success he got two tens on blood dice things are kind of crazy out there aww you got us three weeks there was a giant meatball that seemed to be turning people into other things oh yeah there was a guy that we know that when we woke up all of a sudden he was a wizard and he had electricity coming off of him do you play d&d hey i have some merch we were going to sell in my pocket do you want coasters i've got some strongjaw coasters sort of like the scales are less vibrant here's the thing we just want to know what's going on with us we just want to know what's going on we don't know anything is there something we can do to help you that will you know we help you you help us help us figure out what's happening yeah i'm really good at rat catching i'm sneaky any other animals that you don't care about that's good a boon we can do that i mean we're really nice pretty genuine-- no it'll kill us i saw what happened to matt how long have you been a lizard person lock have you always been a lizard person are you thousands of years old cool just wondering i mean we might not change back you guys let's go it's one of those oh cute marlo

second it's really bad maybe get a different one can i see a door is there a door is there anything cool in this room are there buttons i open the gate is it possible an entire day passed while we were down there because it's still real super dark it's just regular humans nobody seems scared they're not running around it's not scary i'm suddenly super uncomfortable with it ugh stinky meal but no successes it's going to be so stinky he's taking a while eww i feel like there are more subtle ways to get blood you're going to kill him it's different when you're surrounded by crazy things but now that we're out in the normal-- you can't shove a whole body into the-- but what if the poo is stacked really high gross okay anyone we recognize four successes oh my god wait i know those guys no but i have a feeling i feel like mike is just crazy enough that he'd be down for this i'm going to go talk to mike for a second hey okay let's go hi mike what's up i know it's been a while no totally fine you know there's a bunch of stuff going on have you seen what's happening over at geek & sundry i totally understand hey i have a quick question for you we're doing a vampire shoot yeah it's pretty tight ti-ti-tight you want to say hi to travis he's over here i know you're busy but dude i really think you want to see him one two just two successes but no-- well yeah no ones at all yeah i mean i really think you'll be interested in this so we're going to make small talk on the way back over like i was wondering if you had any pickleback stuff because i have been craving-- it's a whiskey shot with pickle juice as a chaser i'm so sorry i didn't-- we meet up with travis hey travis look our shoot is right around the corner here and we take him around the side of the crypt but don't kill him no here's the thing no mike's cool with it look mike i have a proposition for you have you ever met a vampire have they ever sucked your blood would you be willing to go for that again no you get to be sucked that happens post-bite yeah that's how they did in interview too be nice about it what are you doing he said he was cool with it no you're going to kill mike i rolled three successes do i see it happening i'm going to try and stop him i love you (sobbing) no wits plus brawl where's wits it's six did you get a ten i got a four i want to jump on travis' back before he kills him travis don't kill mike don't kill him he's human no no travis don't kill him he's fine with it he said he was fine with it no i just don't want him to die he knows we're vampires it's fine no seriously i know you're saying okay i know you do that and then you're going to snap his neck no he totally would know it's really hard to do i know no just wake him up he's fine you want to bite manzi see you're fine we can't get rid of the last one without killing something don't worry about it thank you just wake him up and tell him he's going to be a vampire soon mike mike how are you mike you fell over you passed out you said you wanted us to that's how you turn into a vampire so be ready you're probably going to turn in the next few days yeah they've been looking for you i think have a fun shoot it's like i said when we were in the offices everything was weird and it seemed okay and now that we're out there's humans around oh that's creepy you have poop on you i can smell poop on you god i'm so sorry you had to witness all of this and we have coasters it was so good wow did you feel better let's do this no mike diva's alive i hope we make it out of la before people find his body the cleaners the porta potty cleaners do i have cake in my teeth is he a vampire you can't tell it's a club where vampires are the globes oh that would have been so smart i smile at him i'm trying to make you smile back at me did he smile at us damn it i don't think we're trying to get drunk sam it's like a blade club where they bring humans in and then when the music hits then everybody gets bit i start dancing we have no money no they took all of our stuff maybe check and see if the bartender is a vampire i'm gonna dance too i'm definitely dancing too the alcohol can you imagine if somebody walked up to the bartender doing this shit he'd be like get the fuck out it's gonna taste like shit sam and i have started line dancing i walk over to sam and be like you just don't trust me just don't me too i could sneak past him oh our friends yeah that's good why i'm going to go over against the wall in the dark and obfuscate you can't even see me can i try to go and do i need to roll to obfuscate i roll my hunger roll three hunger roll wits and stealth like you do two successes is that on your health what is this health and humanity stuff that we haven't even looked at yet we can all go up the bouncer's gone let's go can i come down the stairs from above and be like what are you guys doing down here these guys are with me two successes one blood fail well yeah but those don't count it's only blood fails that count hold it maybe it will coagulate or scab over better than one stop sucking on my husband's finger did you see us go up i come back down he's the last one i swear come on in interview with a vampire it's bad to feed on other vampires right it's bad to feed on other vampires but in the book series i read vampires fed on other vampires and it was totally chill does it feel like blade like are people dressed super-cool are there any tables in the corner anywhere where it looks like important people would be sitting hey satine can you help us well do you know what happened there do you know what happened up at the studio it's fucking crazy it went crazy like the server room is a giant meatball everybody's-- like nobody told us what was going on we just woke up in coffins is he like us we were buried with no money does that matter is this like a mushroom-- (singing) maybe we can get rid of some of this hunger help us something red drink it up homies true vampires just kidding baby if it had been somebody we didn't know it's just because it was mike california king comfy do we get rid of one of our blood dice from this lager (squealing) i run over and start dancing with erika are you a vampire oh my god how long have you been a vampire really oh that would make so much sense erika where are the people that run this place where are the people that run this place how do we find them how do we know what's going on it's great this is a lot for me celebrities okay should we be nervous oh my god this makes so much sense like he's a ninja for real what's up man we didn't set it off it went off around us no i don't think it was matt that did it i think-- yeah they said that people go down in their tunnels they're super pissed no it was the head of the lizard guys so gygax said he wanted to play with matt mercer but then mercer got killed by the sun and so-- so how long does it take to actually turn nobody walked us through it is that bad i didn't mind i mean the only person that i killed got burned up in the fire when everything-- so it wasn't like we left any evidence you know yeah nowhere in public are you adopting us oh no yeah we can get sorted give us a family how do we get a sponsor i'm going to look for my big-- this vein and i'm going to stick it in there almost a lizard person how much blood do you need i filled the cup up like halfway brawl why fight when you got up and gave a speech is somebody about to fight you oh kotori that was the name yeah that was the name of the leader did he die sam you shouldn't have tried to hit on that girl after she told you no one critical success oh man should we talk or is it best to-- i give a big hug back please don't stab me in the back i knew it why is he stabbing me wil titansgrave n-n-n-n-n-nineteen oh damn two successes one point of-- is that marked off on the health okay why i thought we were buds she's going to kill you i thought wil was my friend i got it because i didn't say anything yeah your speech was very poor (laughs) it was so bad it scared me out of talking what about travis did nobody stab travis on the grand poobah i saved your life i'm just slashed across the back still i read a lot of vampire novels i've watched a lot of movies i played a vampire in skyrim and in bloodrayne here's the thing nobody told us we weren't supposed to do that i didn't know it was fight or flight at that point and as soon we got out to the real world and we were around actual humans and i realised it wasn't the apocalypse-- i kept him from killing somebody oh babe that's really sweet no i'm not okay with that can i help him can i aid him what do i do okay i have a critical success i have two tens and two more successes outside of that so four successes two of them are critical mary which one travis or-- you're taking me you're going to adopt me oh my god what about stove are we cool that we're still married and we're in different families okay cool
