she's writing in all caps sprinter's boots (laughing) oh god oh god really okay can ashley roll do you want to roll ashley she's-- oh oh no should we read that oh she should take-- she should take a potion or something she's got a-- she's got a greater healing-- pike has a greater healing potion that i know of so she can take it she's got 15 points that's true should she wait should she hold it well i want-- it's an action if she-- if she gives it to anybody else she can't she can only take it as a bonus action for herself - oh that's really good though nineteen - we just gotta get out of here oh my god we're all gonna-- i'm not gonna say it -we're gonna-- - we're gonna get through this you guys we're all gonna get through this fuck -

eleven for pike seriously - she's unconscious we're-- we're-- i don't know how we're gonna get scanlan back but he's there and-- just waiting crossbow loaded yeah and then we can't get out a bunch of dead people you could get a bunch of dead people out that wasn't her last spell by the way she's got three spell slots left close to death - he's closer to death than me pike's unconscious - i'm one fail he's two fails scanlan's dead i've got cure wounds if i'm awake no keyleth no i don't know man lava lava has a new rule now oh my god 53 - get up get out you can get out of it you've got seven points left can she get out of the lava or is she just in belly flopped into lava at least you're out - oh my god this is the worst does j'mon sa ord have any healing spells sweet even better you're double digits scanlan we've got to just-- we've got to get scanlan back it's gilmore - the round's still going so it's grog it's your turn grog 4d8 plus four i mean 4d4 plus four so pike is awake what's going-- actually she does have a third level spell left - yes she cast revivify at fourth level the last time holy shit i have it circled right i'm scared of all these dice i failed it yeah cause the only time you used it before was when you bamfed up to my broom after i grabbed the dagger yes kima's conscious it's the last egg just worried there's gonna be another lair action in the same spot it needs like a dispel or something i wonder-- i wonder if the beehive thing above us that the holes are covered in magic as well am i-- i am conscious but i don't know what that says but it's now my question is pike runs up thank you oh oh if she runs up is she gonna be able to get her hand on-- on scanlan she says she can use the sprinter's boots twice in all caps actually she did write that before we said it - okay so pike puts her hands on either side of his face and says scanlan your letter to me was wonderful and i want to do what you asked but i can't raise kaylee alone i need you to come back and she casts revivify on him i'm so scared thirteen warm up does anybody have a blanket - okay - she did she sent a picture of the sprinter's boots cards with two uses glad you're back scanlan are we gonna have to take a short rest can i-- can i-- i know i'm gonna-- can i broom up to the holes god i'm so scared to get on this broom again oh in our order did you let the dog out scanlan did you let the dog out do you have it left - why would you just-- wait but-- i hate that we can't get out of this fucking area don't get too close into this area percy cause this is where the fucking lair action keeps coming up what are you gonna do are you gonna run and hit an egg there's an egg left over there - did it look like thordak you were right or by-- maybe we should hold onto a piece and try to pass through it that's me i used a level-- did i use a level four spell already shit oh that's right i did i did use it cause i was-- so i have a level three left who needs healing me and pike and everybody you do so do i i got five i got five points how many you got so you have nine points i'm gonna take a healing potion i mean i'm gonna cast cure wounds on myself - so 20 points - okay can i run over and get some dragon guts on my hand and then to try to put my hand through the thingy please let me out of this spot oh does your guilt have a mass cure wounds in that case doesn't matter oh geez fuck - fuck fuck can i sense anyone but j'mon sa ord as far as dragons go nearby i drop down to my knees and concentrate - nothing nothing she's nowhere fuck i can't believe that we all came back it was just giant clusterfuck from like halfway through with just everybody falling down and trying to get back up unconscious so gone gone-gone - and then if you hadn't counter spelled the color what oh my god - wait what is a 10 is 10 insta-death what is 10 well hopefully oh my god oh yeah if j'mon had not gotten three two one i got to attack one time that round every other round was just trying not to die
