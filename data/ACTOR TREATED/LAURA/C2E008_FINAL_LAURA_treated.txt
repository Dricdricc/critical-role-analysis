mean he takes many forms maybe i'm the traveler i mean yeah sure i worship him sure he's more like my best friend probably how do you know what the traveler's like do you hang out with the traveler too oh right well he's probably not the traveler then have you ever killed someone before i'm okay with that oh yeah who was it that had that stuff can i have it i like rings ooh what does it look like is it like a kaleidoscope i don't know what does it look like do they fit over your-- ooh then look at the ring that i want he totally just took the ring from-- ooh do any of the rings that i have on my fingers have a pearl on them (gasps) you have a pearl do you want me to carry it for you let's do it i hope they have milk i'm going to sit next to caleb and watch it all happen don't you need to pull out your book so you can look at your spells oh this is true while he's doing everything he's doing i'm going try to very subtly draw a dick in his book natural 20 it's our first item what is it caleb you can stand on and move across any liquid surface where did that come from probably it was probably nott wow this ring is so cool what is it how fortunate what is it what is it of course i do yeah i'm on the level liam  this is too dangerous for you to have i'm keeping this one-- you have to tell us unless it's a wand that makes doughnuts or pickles then i probably won't try to steal it probably no caleb yes what does it do wait he's doing it ah oh jesus okay okay okay okay oh 12 oh it didn't do anything that's a very low dc because i rolled shit a dc yeah that's a nine right it's a nein sam and plus three what kind of metal is it to the blacksmith i have a glaive look at this glaive a glaive whoa is it too dangerous for me to have what is a glaive is it something that i could use can i use a two-handed weapon oh i have a shield yes i need to get a better weapon though you guys because this sickle doesn't do much it's really cool-looking right that's why got it how's it balanced is it good no well what does it do because how much is it worth okay zadash i'm writing magic glaive (grunts) i don't know not me because i drink milk what is it can you shoot fire from your hands can you shoot lightning from your hands can you catch things really well i don't like caleb looking at our shit anymore he just looks at it and steals it (gasps) this is so cute this is a great wand i point the wand at nott (laughs) i pull the mask down oh my goodness that's really creepy nott how do i make it stop i think it lasts for a while yes it's a wand of smiles they have to roll a dc of ten for charisma saving throw or be forced to smile for a minute that's the cutest fucking wand i love it we'll find out where's-- oh frumpkin frumpkin's gone okay oh well you don't want to keep it you hate burning people you have to stick it on your forehead what does it do look this ring is perfect for you that way if we get near water you don't go in it cheers to caleb thank you fjord for saving my life didn't you give me a potion i woke up and you were over me giving me a potion like a knight in shining armor i probably would have probably i did do it for you though nott i saved your life i hold the wand under the table at caleb's leg and try to do it to him too it's charisma you had me do charisma you succeeded but you didn't even know i tried but we have always been roommates okay matt's totally taking advantage of the fact that none of us are hagglers this game it's hard it's really hard totally obvious that he's fucking us over (imitates crute's laugh) more money will come tomorrow because we are selling the ears tomorrow yeah of course yeah i have the ears right here in this pickle jar no i have them it's okay like who wants pickled ears really except for me i'm going to go eat some pickled ears no i don't i go upstairs and i'm conversing with the traveler i'm going to doodle and talk to the traveler can i draw the general gnoll peeing on a little fire hydrant and the rest of the gnolls behind him fighting over a bone then i'm going to draw the cutest baby manticore you've ever seen and it's dead i'm going to tell the traveler you know i don't know what's going on i'm just hoping that you're here because this is the farthest i've ever gone and i'm afraid that you can't hear me anymore and it's freaking me out a little bit because i know that i'm around a bunch of people now and i haven't been before but i want you to know that you're still my best friend and if you want me to be alone i will be if that means that you'll be here thank you okay that's all good night what did you hear that oh right oh shit i take the symbol and i hold it up to my cheek and i go to sleep he's totally looking shakäste's wouldn't it be funny if there was like two copper and a bunch of bird seed shakäste was fucking loaded oh jeez you stole an old blind man's food and money the pearl pops out and flies across the room never to be found again one ear's up hey what okay what okay i'm really smart so i'll probably be able to figure it out demedan your request has been approved and the toordolbo extract will be arriving in a case of rose wine from the evening nip in the coming week many gifts the gentleman i don't know but i like your addition of douche to demedan i agree oh yeah who specializes in a rosé you're right that's weird especially not the baumbauchs no they make like ale toordolbo oh bloodroot that's good what if it's the boltodoor bloodroot is probably pretty good though would i know bloodroot 20 oh bloodroot that's right it's a type of flower super-duper red i know because i tried to make a paint out of one of the flowers one time and it made me want to like seriously puke my guts out and do the spins if you know what i mean super bad that's bad that means it would be extra strong yeah oh my gosh well the gentleman wants to poison people oh no the baumbauchs yeah i understand wow do we need to tell someone about this if we hear about an outbreak of people vomiting-- or about a rosé yeah in the coming week that's soon when did you steal this oh my gosh what if we could intercept it then we could have all of the poison and the nips i like it let's make a decision we just did it oh man i'm really hungry though i'm going to go downstairs these ears 19 sets yeah no it was 19 sets i marked down sets technically matt i'm not telling bryce this five of those sets are hyenas 14 of those are gnolls for sure we also brought home live people and also some dead people we brought home seven dead bodies 25 gold a piece how many live people did we bring back i didn't have those in jars that's right i did write down herma and jules petrov oh wait oh that's right wait did anybody write down the

he did a great service to your city starosta it's good to see you again it's been a while about hold on i get out my sketchbook and i look through it maybe like eight years almost your hair hasn't changed though you should change it the ruby of the sea says hello of course make sure he spells it right fjord he really should have changed his hair i mean it's pretty hideous oh he visited my mother years ago yes the ruby of the sea you've heard of her no well she's mostly known for her hmm-hmm-hmm outside of that her voice is amazing you should hear her sing what does what mean she has sex for money mostly i mean people pay her a large sum it's like three guys mostly she keeps a few people at a time she doesn't see everybody because she's super famous you would you really would (singing) the ruby of the sea is the best lay ever yeah well i wouldn't know exactly because she never told anybody that i was there i bet if she had it would've been crazy you know in my room well no i wasn't trapped but you know-- she read me some stories and a lot of times i would listen at the door and hear her sing no exactly i totally understand she loves me so much she really really does it's just you know people frown upon courtesans with daughters mm-hmm yeah yes that's why i'm such a good painter oh no that came from the traveler well yes well yes but-- i feel so nervous all of a sudden everybody's looking at me okay so they were totally in love and she was going to marry him and he was totally in love with her and he was going to marry her and they said they were going to get married and then she got pregnant with me and he said-- they got married and he was going to go set up his house and then he just never came back i know it is really sad no i'm going to find him so that i have somewhere to live because i'm not allowed to be at the house anymore well because i'm kind of in trouble in nicodranas well because i sort of played a prank on this guy who was seeing my mom well-- so the traveler taught me how to make myself look like other people right so i made myself look like my mom and then i lured him out onto our balcony and he was wearing nothing but this girdle of hers and then i locked the door and i thought that was funny you know it looked really good in my sketchbook yeah which is no big deal but then i found out he's a lord he was really pissed off it was in the day oh everyone it was so great but he said he wanted to kill me and they said-- --that was cool and he could so my mom was like go and i was like okay lord something something lord robert something something i'll remember it eventually i thought so too he looked really good i know right well i mean-- i know right i mean i've never met him i thought it would be cool that's who i was looking for when i met fjord over there i mean he's supposed to be pretty darn cool he wears lots of rings on his fingers too you guys thank you kind sir fjord it's your letter bye thank you bryce
