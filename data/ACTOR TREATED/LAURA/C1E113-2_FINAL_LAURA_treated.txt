you should because it's really good yeah do it all again the forcs wait did we actually take a short rest i thought it was intentional we took a moment so i didn't actually get my action surge back am i don't you worry about it samuel should i run down there and kill him i don't know maybe we can lead him toward us and then-- yeah and then you can take him out away from the guards that're sleeping what if we hit him with a rock and he comes looking for it oh that's a good idea and i take a really big branch and i break it in half (hooting) i'm trying to sound like an owl in the night hoo-hoo okay i like it do i roll at advantage then oh i rolled a three minus two oh no hit him before he does that 22 times two do it rip it out quietly you should snap its neck it's quieter he's a creative one mozuu i think they know we're here we didn't take a short rest though that would've been real smart maybe i should rest while this is going on because i should really rest you're going to sleep too wow 5d8 it's 5d8 of-- oh okay i know no eight you could hide so they can't see you i'm going to jump down i'm going to run at them and attack the one that's got him oh no four slam down with my

is that's right unbreakable that's me kill the weak one wait seven times two because it was a critical so 14 you're so speedy i walk over and use my maul and smash down on one of the ones that's sleeping ooh 16 plus eight so that's definitely going to hit and it's not a crit yeah 20 plus five 25 here i'll catch you no of course not right as he jumps i let go and start picking my nose don't bite his throat i start grabbing at him like it's a piece of paper blowing in the wind oh no athletics or what athletics is ten 25 we're going to ask you some questions seven i lift him up hanging by his ankle do we want to use him as a pi√±ata who do you serve who do you work for who sent you where are you from who do you work for all right i drop him should we take a short rest while we talk about him can i sit down i'm going to sit down and listen to what he's saying he can't break me i'm unbreakable man-swine can you show us in 30 minutes because i want to take a short break we'll pretend that we're the guards that we just killed i'm going to use him as a pillow as i take a short rest no but then we'd be-- doesn't work as well if you join us you could be my pillow as long as you want i fluff him up and lay down almost full not quite it's okay borg-borg well he said his name twice all right i sit up you're very comfy i start taking his ropes off him as i pat his little head well because i thought he needs to walk i don't understand what the problem is all right should i undo his feet then okay is the bright lord down there do all of you wear special hats or something that's pretty i could wear that you want me to give it a try all right i walk over to mozuu and slap him as hard as i can across the face five i can't understand you and then what no no the man-eater the face-eater good idea i start yanking his robes off of his hands his robes off his ropes off of his hands i'll take his robes off too just in case all right i give him his robes back
