search of him the party meets his childhood friend and their new companion the gnome cleric pike grog apparently hasn't been acting normally and had marched off on his own through the bramblewood towards the ominous mountain gatshadow the party followed dispensing with a troop of roadside thieves along the way and wound their way toward the mountain deep within they encountered an abandoned subterranean city and eventually a crypt housing a mind-controlled grog the reanimated corpse of his father strongjaw and a dying mage attempting a ritual to lichdom our heroes slayed the mage but not before he could complete the ritual and embed his phylactery into grog's chest returning to town in search of aid they find there are few of enough knowledge or power to ascertain the nature of grog's wound also rumors of missing children begin to reach the party's ears while contemplating all this at a local inn the party is approached by a mysterious elf named drez vina who wishes to pay handsomely for the party to infiltrate an archmage's tower and retrieve a particular brass box within pushing forward in the hopes of speaking with this archmage the party accepts and passes through arcane trap after trap to reach the top of the tower deciding not to steal from the archmage but instead parley with him for his aid the tower's keeper realmseer eskil ryndarien agrees to help and sends the party to collect two items he requires for the ritual the skull of a nightmare and the heart of a nymph the caveat their defeated foe is indeed a lich now and in merely two weeks he will be reborn within grog they travel north to the umbra hills wrestle with a small cult to slay their infernal messenger and his nightmare steed and find a fresh companion in percy newly freed from imprisonment from there the party rushes south to the frostweald a forest shrouded in eternal winter battling past basilisks the party finds a single unfrozen pool where they coax a nymph from her dimensional sanctuary talking their way out of battle grog enters the sanctuary with the nymph and returns holding a jewel gifted by the beautiful creature the heart of the nymph is trinket allowed to
