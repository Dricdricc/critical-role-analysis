how's it going you haven't seen a single episode have you i'm so nervous i thought we were gonna get a theme song oh no what do we do i know what do we do wait there's little things that means there's probably cards  or something that go in here i mean the potions alone all the ingredients a little overwhelming but so freaking cool oh yeah where marisha found the tarot cards but i stole them from her very quickly because apparently i do that wait i'm gonna look and see if i can find special-- they're numbered i swear you guys i'm so lost  [everyone agreeing] we're trying to gather-- we're trying to cast a spell exploding potion we can make an exploding potion let's look i immediately start thinking i can make an exploding spell a potion  that will get us out of the room like no problem  so i start looking for ingredients to make an exploding potion  which is probably the wrong idea there's probably a magician in here is there head of garlic over there it's an exploding one it'll get us out of here wait elixir seven elixir seven this one's important we haven't done anything that is when i realized we might be in trouble what is he doing boredas stupificus boredas stupificus boredas stupificus that's gotta mean i'm really stupid in latin that you made us repeat over and over again marisha and how many times-- boredas stupificus [continue chanting] that's cool thanks guys thanks i think probably we're taking so long on the very first clue  we need to have the helping hand okay tower it is tower what's the last word what's the last word what's the last word okay oh what do i see in this amazing crystal ball oh it's doing something the crystal ball lights up matt starts reading it is it backwards yeah it's an anagram these letters make a spell but purification isn't-- there's no f in this that's it the potion of puissance dust of funny bone snake fangs no wait wait wait there's water what about water or a slug it's starting to figure out that this potion is gonna be a huge pain in my ass peppermint acid sour sardines spiders eat flies oh what about this coagulated blood of flies drops of water now water octopus's ink you're gonna eat this chris i'm putting in the peppermint oh dragon's tears we're putting in dragon's tears what is acridness none of us have any idea what acrid means acromantula or sardines or cod liver oil and then we sing-- is there one in there that says something about strength grandma's sweat [jenga] i know what that's from and then we sing-- is there one in there that says something about strength grandma's sweat [jenga] i know what that's from that's it that's it it's going in ground vocal cords who's gonna drink it gross ha ha he had to drink that wasn't me pull out the sword from the stone adding vinegar to the potion we added vinegar matt and everybody that's been working on the potion solve it try it matt he drinks it-- [travis offscreen] --nothing happens  [sounds of frustration] is it because we added things to it that shouldn't be in there i haven't really been helping much at this point so i start looking around the room  for secret doors and things that i can pull the candlesticks by the way-- don't move but i tried all of them gain might-- the finishing touch must be sung maybe we just have to sing it  ♪ i'm drinking this potion down ♪ ♪ oh yeah and it's disgusting ♪ this potion is foul i'm pretty sure we put some wrong ingredients in there  because it made me want to puke just a little bit the sorrow is dragon's tears as we're pouring through these various potion elements i immediately remember that one of the spells  we have on the table immediately relates to making something holy or blessed right there right-- no here okay wait now what's next that was the coagulated blood now sing it and drink it matt in magic it's not the song that matters but the purity of the singing travis is tall travis is tall ♪ i'm so short ♪ which he did and nothing happened a spell what is this and lo and behold-- i found it [reading scroll] wait decode it where's the necklace [matt offscreen] i glance over and start looking through some of the  potion materials on the shelf and i can see this nice little square  sticking out of the top of one of the large vase-type structures okay the book of spells okay now what so once we have everything finally put together for this i put it all on have my big harry potter moment i got this one so we start trying to find which line connects to which item travis takes one of the lines and marisha takes one of the lines so i take one of the lines  and we're all tracing and following each other around while not colliding with each other it's very strange the third one down is this cat we rocked that one pretty hardcore fuck the potion puzzle i gotta say everyone fell into place very quickly on that i was very excited fuck the potion puzzle  blacklight puzzle though yeah yeah all about that i'm the third maybe we should write the symbols okay what is it arcana okay that's an r then r r-- order okay time arcana order focus balance-- oh the cat is number three at first i thought they might be related to the tarot cards glad i didn't go that far this is two four four is the rock number one is the feather number two is the matches  number three is the cat four is rock five is chalice six is the last thing to banish evil conjoined be arranged in banded geometry  once per soul chant the spell until the evil sounds its death knell this was probably the final spell to finally banish this dark sorcerer  and complete this puzzle i hope conjoined be oh good then you can see which one is the top and the bottom wait what's the top one dimisisti inimicum meum in tenebras we have this spell that we've arranged geometrically banded together were we supposed to be in banded geometry what does that mean in geometry  i don't honestly know what's happening right now like it is completely confusing to me oh that's a-- for the wand though isn't it we know we're on the cusp of finally winning this and we hear this creak behind us  and we're like did we do it no but seriously i kind of want to live here and matt had to drink a disgusting mixture three times the vocal cords weren't supposed to go in there we were just supposed to sing it but there's vocal cords
