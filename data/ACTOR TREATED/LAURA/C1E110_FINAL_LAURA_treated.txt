did you what did you say about merchandise cool sorry about that do i still have pass without a trace on us i will be behind them yeah i'm bamfing him out right now i didn't get to sort them you can read dwarven now you can read now grog you can read four- to five-letter words thanks scanlan let's do that keep moving up right that's where the city is while she's doing a nature check i want to do primeval awareness and sense undead in the area within a mile of me within the mile are they all above us or are some near us what if we earthquake the titan to fucking fall apart yeah but we could take out the entire city but it couldn't move for a while potentially it could shit out a lot of dwarven zombies yeah mostly liam what do you think he just did do you think he just fell we'll keep going quickly then we probably should right i want to go with him i need to keep an eye out for the zombie dwarves that's good add ten to it i crawled up but then once he took off again then i stayed i guess we follow i think that means that there's a split in the path scanlan you go one way and we'll go the other if it's facing us no its right our left percy keyleth keyleth dig him out i start clawing at the wall where he was i would be closer to percy than trinket is no wait oh no you guys guess what we didn't do we didn't have a feast 21 as well how do we fight rocks that sounded like you were casting a spell but you slice his fingers off when he does it okay i'm going to cast hunter's mark on the biggest one this one and then i'm going to shoot him with sharpshooter wait okay oh no 19 minus five 14 yeah you motherfucker okay 16 wait i didn't say sharpshooter i didn't say sharpshooter on that one did i i didn't clarify it would be 21 i should've said it but i didn't say it 16 plus five lightning damage and then since he is next to scanlan i get sneak attack ooh 12 15 sneak attack and then hunter's mark three yeah i'm going to stay where i am don't you add six though natural 20 the ground raised up she's fine oh wait that's pike hold on yes it hits me my armor class is 21 can we shoot him with an arrow as he sinks into the ground they're all vanishing squish him make a building out of him i don't know now i've got david bowie in my head he got bigger that's so cool look how much bigger she is than those fucks aw buddy you're okay well i would if it was trinket's turn pike's going to run down and stand between scanlan and grog oh grog yeah and then she's going to hold her action until a thing appears attacking oh right okay i'm going to call trinket away from the wall so he's going to run down next to grog and then i'm going to kick off and get on my broom so i'm off the ground don't speak how high is the ceiling in here yeah i'm going to want to hover right in the middle i don't want to be high up i want to be right between the ceiling and the floor yeah (southern accent) and i'm going to hold my action until i can see one of those things uh-huh pass without a trace is still-- oh no no i hunter's marked the minute something shows we're all going to be like boom but nothing's going to show thanks grog oh no down there why does it matter that we're clustered yeah they can still sense you and then we won't know that you didn't get sucked under oh shut up that's so cool ten feet oh no oh no he rolled a one oh no this was a fan gift oh no is trinket right next to grog at least oh now trinket's all alone and me yeah that's a thing 26 okay the first one definitely hits the second one is 18 awesome are you fucking kidding me he's not hunter's marked 27 combined yeah i need more coffee oh good she can attack him i want to do it i should not have claimed this oh we don't add anything to it she was saving her action though it doesn't hit i put my foot on its fist and-- oh my god thank you so much i know but i didn't think anybody was going to do it really go for the gnome that means she can still attack she can't see anything though no i mean there's nothing to attack in front of her he's underground still we're holding a physical action so she has to be next to something in order to attack it did you use all your movement can you get within ten feet of something five feet of something i want to be able to hit it if it comes up oh man should she do a cantrip she should do a resistance or something but that's an action it's not a bonus i'm going to help i'm right there that's what i'm going to be aiming at darling he's raging he doesn't have logic okay i'm going to move my hunter's mark over to that dude (radar sounds) and then i'm going to attack him with sharpshooter so i'm at 20 okay this is so weird four lightning damage 28 for the first arrow plus the four lightning damage and then the second attack is also sharpshooter and that one hits yes definitely six lightning damage 19 oh and i didn't add plus 20 to both of those plus 20 overall because of the sharpshooter you're welcome i'm going to stay wait what about trinket can he try to save against it i don't know what the difference for a saving throw for trinket would be 15 can i hear him does he make noise i don't even know it's trinket do i i aim my bow at it she's attacking it does it no she gets to act first yeah so that's 24 to attack she always gets that now that's 2d6 plus four radiant damage so ten 14 should that count it's not as good as the unintentional but that's okay 19 yeah does she just attack the once she goes grog watch this you can see you're big yeah because she got trapped be careful i think there's another elemental right there i think trinket's an elemental oh no don't you make me attack my own bear oh no 17 trinket i run i would see you the minute you attacked oh we got to take off we got to start moving run i think she's saying run as we're running i cast pass without a trace again should i okay never mind i don't cast it is it old is this-- no this is not mountain this is titan okay so not underdark do we know what gods dwarves worshipped do they have specific gods five she had stealth boots yeah but it doesn't matter because she's got the dawnmartyr do you know where can you sense where it is you want to fight it and there's no other exit from this cylindrical chamber okay oh i mean we could try it i'll put pike on the broom and we'll fly over to the side of the cave-in yeah but she can turn undead as an action as an action yeah oh wait you can use your channel divinity twice between rests and is she 18th level ooh so now she can do it three times between rests so we should try to get her in and turn him okay yeah let's do that percy really wants to find treasure well we could just turn around and walk away and find our way up to the city all right okay okay okay i'm going to cast pass without a trace on us now it could just be a fight to take away our stuff before we go to a bigger fight yeah fine oh my god come on we cannot wait for 15 minutes while he's doing that what say it again you should open the door you should open the door yeah 16 no grog ready to turn undead can pike see undead in there plus 11 20 can we see anything that points to what deity it is from inside the chamber can we see anything oh yeah no what about pike though because she's looking in 13 you're going to try to undo the trap (groans) luck okay good are you making sure nothing's invisible in there i'm peeking in the door yeah they're not locking you were shutting them as you went it's not that they were locked they were trapped just wanted to double check ah it's all empty i look over at percy it makes me far too uncomfortable how excited you are about this oh no oh no you rolled too low it's okay well it's not okay he's got better constitution 75 points of poison damage oh that's good the box is empty was it worth it there's a center cylinder there is an undead thing maybe one undead guy got stuck in the middle you know what scanlan you should probably bamf inside and see no no i'm joking oh shit there's no traps no let's just pick his for this i'm not in this room outside the door seven oh my god so pike is-- pike runs over and casts greater restoration on scanlan no you're not scanlan no you're not she gets ready she casts turn undead yeah so she should do that pike's going to rush in as he's doing that and try to rip the hammer away from the body and run out of the room she's like well check for traps because we've been there darling we've been there check for fucking traps how about nobody dies get out i found a hammer grog is it cursed can we tell if it's cursed can we tell if it's bad i don't know yeah here does it feel magic we suck what about the belt oh it needs attunement just to have it this is totally worth it we don't know what any of this shit is you can do what yeah the other fucking direction does it look like that thing in the nine hells that we saw or in the city of brass (gentle old man impression) thank god you're here i've been-- you don't know what matt would've done with whatever you think eww what is that do any of us know what it was read it out loud okay that's really big what is this creature do we know what this creature is scanlan with disadvantage oh well that's better than four is there anything else interesting in this cavern that we can see yes thank you for informing us oh man yeah uncharted the lost legacy came out this week you should check it out i play nadine you should go see it go see it and then play it yeah and also marvel's spider-man show premiered on the 19th i'm gwen stacy on that i saw the episode too and it was really good i wanted to look in the chamber and see if there was anything else interesting before we walked out i didn't roll it 29 do they look rich okay we're in a hurry right i'm not going to go search for stuff yeah i'll look around 21 no hinges no nothing did you want to smash your way through this very loudly no yeah maybe try to push it first a really old fart can i feel if there's any wind coming from one of the tunnels like there's an opening somewhere that leads out yeah i want to feel the wind on my face thanks 25 for wind (laughter) can i tell where it's coming from her mace i think there's an exit ahead and to the right (whispering) maybe you should kill it before it says anything to you i don't know this is all you that fast oh fuck indianapolis oh i guess i'd be next to-- bear is with grog trinket really likes grog he's a big guy 24 oh i didn't roll for pike ooh 16 for pike hunter's mark that troll that i see i'm going to hunter's mark grog okay and i'm going to shoot him with a natural one okay this one is going to be sharpshooter with blazing bowstring so hopefully-- goddamn it what the fuck oh my god that's 11 to hit jesus h macy can i climb up those rocks behind me and stand on the top of them and then trinket is going to run over and stand next to pike he's going to try to protect us can he move far enough to be on the other side of her 40 yeah he goes to the other side really that's what she's going to do i guess it's undead she can't try to turn undead fine 23 great good it takes an additional 2d6 radiant because he's undead with her mace of disruption i just did it's seven 2d6 plus four radiant damage so that's what all he rolled and then since it's undead it's an additional 2d6 an additional seven because he's undead whoa fuck yeah one for each can't she move away from him oh no because he will get an attack oh yeah you've been trying to attune to it he started attuning to it as soon as percy felt something from the belt so if it's been long enough are you going to attack the guy with it oh no this is something weird is it like if you roll below a certain thing you hit yourself instead oh my god roll high wait you forgot to add stuff he's going to get back up is there other shit in there he goes for keyleth those are good attacks without sneak attack no 25 to hit i know that's the problem none of us want to do anything they're regenerating something's holding them together that's why i was hoping my bowstrings would work but i missed my shot t-pose please yeah i don't have any of that well but my blazing bowstring i'm going to try it i'm going to shoot the one that i tried to hit before yeah i'm going to do it i'm going to try sharpshooter again goddamn it that doesn't hit (sighs) okay i'm going to try it again yeah plus 14 minus five that one hits that definitely hits that is yeah so that hits right okay i didn't say blazing bowstring so it doesn't count 14 plus one lightning damage yeah sneak attack plus six is 14 for the sneak attack and then five for hunter's mark i didn't say blazing bowstring for my bonus-- oh wait that's a 4th-level spell should i use it or not all right i'll save it i'm going to transfer the hunter's mark to the one attacking my brother and then trinket is going to run up and stand next to my brother so you can get flank attack should she do turn undead each undead she can see within 30 feet yeah they're scared of her yeah they have to move away if it's got nowhere to move it can use dodge it doesn't say does it one minute or until it takes any damage nice at least it can't do a bite attack any more what the fuck is this stupid-ass hammer are you drunk we've got to chop it up or set it on fire what does that mean i know i don't know what it means 23 jeez scanlan you need better armor you're going to smoke everybody is it possible to do it without hitting grog it's scanlan's choice you're a dick oh motherfuck 11 can you use that wand again you can do that you didn't even see it no i'm going to fly over can i get to a place where i can see the troll well how many is this i have 50 feet on my broom i'm going to shoot him and he's still hunter's marked 17 oh thank god i didn't say it it didn't happen 13 plus three lightning damage plus one hunter's mark 21 the blazing bowstring blazing bowstring sorry i only get two per short rest so if we don't rest then i don't get it again six lightning damage plus nine plus two 11 but that's the exit that's where we need to go to shit would trinket have been able to make it over to him (singing) guiding bolt up the butt i don't think so 12 guiding bolt we need to get out of here it's crumbling i go check for traps on that chest right there 14 all right then i'm going to open it awesome look at all this money i'm going to pick up that little pile of gold those couple pieces of gold i see on the ground can you get through it keyleth whatever other tunnel options there's probably other monsters trolls fucking undead waiting there too she's going to try to greater restoration grog do you have time to attune to your other thing is it
