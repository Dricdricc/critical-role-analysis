where is he is that where he's at i don't know where he is what is his mother's name it's lenore i know it it's scanlan's mom-- wow really it's sad shaka man oh yeah (laughter) what about black widow do they have black widow hell yeah they do yay thanks marvel puzzle quest (high-pitched) hey there's stuff in the store you guys you should go look in the store and see what is there you're welcome it's going to be epic i'm so excited oh yay no no hey look at this cool dice bag i have it's got a bear damn it [opening credits] you get another thing that's your mantle wait is it a cloak don't you already have a cloak on but can i go talk to keyleth actually i did want to ask you-- are you allowed to leave how does this work exactly should we talk to your dad all right ah they were talking all about you actually yeah yeah yeah it's this whole conversation about you no i heard she was saying how much she admired you and he was saying er i don't think i feel it as much and she was like no really dad you just need a chance to really talk to him and he was like no just believe me i did talk to him and i don't feel that way and then she was like-- never mind (laughter) they actually said that as well they were talking about how amazing i am (laughter) yeah are we doing this tomorrow morning we're heading out to hell first things first what grog oh she's got plane shift right no ships well we know the city that we want to go to dis city we could pop into it we could pop out of it it's very ordered however scalebearer big high guy really important guy said not to make a scene he said if we make a scene that would go poorly i think he's probably kind of powerful might be hard to lift him up you have morning morning has come i mean is it similar to the city of brass it sounds so similar but we are not devils therefore weak and liable to be taken as slaves so the person that we made a contract with was a devil that ended up being the one that killed pike right that was a devil disguised as a demon okay yeah we don't have a wish okay so we make no deals when we go no deals no contracts no shaking of hands no signing of anything oh no don't touch anything that we can wear over those gloves no tary no signing anything no signing of contracts although i'm sure you're good at reading contracts as well yes you can read them but don't sign them how about that no no signing (laughter) and we come back here i don't even remember he signed a contract i feel like that could be very dangerous for one person to go in alone grog no last time you were alone-ish you almost killed two guards in vasselheim right you could always look in doty's diary and find out exactly what happened fu manchu oh really actually i know that from reading a lot about the raven queen i can answer that for you i'm sorry keep going well that's difficult that's difficult (laughter) yeah yeah ashley is in new york (laughs) no it's ashley's character though no but i mean it could be we don't know definitely i'm liking it more are you sure-- okay so we should just go down act like we're evils like our souls have been claimed by another devil already can't they see through that okay maybe you could be our conduit the person that brings us to-- sure wait wait tary do you have anything like a spell you can make any kind of trinket (laughs) that would help keyleth be better at lying well not that no i'm talking an actual like ability to tell lies better something that would up her maybe charisma that's better that's perfect that's perfect seriously seriously yeah all right did you ever get a response from sam on his potions so i didn't want to tell oh i didn't know you wrote it down grog you can't count okay we gotta pass these potions out who wants a superior yeah yeah tary gave them to me did you steal them from me when i wasn't noticing because if you did i would have perceived it yeah i would have because i have really high perceiving yeah i don't want you dying again take the superior is that all right with everyone really tary because you have all those patches i thought that's the reason you gave them to us do you want two regular potions how is that tary is that good for you in addition to your patches or would you want one of the greaters that you bought for us wow all right sure take it back okay i'll take a greater as well good call greater for grog so that's all three greaters taken two regulars for percy two regulars for keyleth and that's-- well that's two regulars left okay so grog you have two regulars and one greater all right he keeps calling him that what about von what about musel infernal but they speak common i'm assuming as well ah shit we don't know anybody who speaks infernal do we why did you take one of the greaters if you can make healing potions on your own right oh yeah understandable man-spreading no i speak abyssal but that's the other ones a succubus tight then make yourself a succubus i really want to see what you look like as a succubus personally oh but that's different than knowing their language no we can't hire anyone why can't we just a hire a tiefling don't you have any other tieflings in your tribe aw that's great i think we go so go in the morning find out if not we'll just go there and hope that someone speaks common yeah it's just hell no big deal fine ish the fucking deal that i made with your fucking goddess who knows if she'll call us out on it but there's that well hell no she creeps me out i saw her face it's fucking weird yeah that happened did you know we saw her the giant white mask i feel like grog's getting more-- i feel like you're lying more now than you used to i actually understood it how fucked-up is that this is true i mean we're all here oh wow this is happening (laughs) good one grog i mean yeah i'm going to hopefully build up my small house no no it needs to be i don't know who that is i would love to know what that is i feel like the grey hunt is something really terrible and you just haven't told me do i get a jolly hat out of it meet something do i get really high is this the whole point of the grey hunt do i have to find the highest animal in the woods oh wow do i go alone or do i get help oh shit sounds fun i look forward to it look my light-up 20 just lit up for no reason as we were talking about it i think it'll go very well don't look at me can we go to bed it's windy you're up on a cliff that's gross he's just been drinking mayo (laughs) that's so gross all right oh cool yeah it does it sounds like klingon emphasis on thok (laughter) (whispers) insight check episode 91 where we force matt to make up an entire language on the spot yai equals yes nai nern (laughter) no not 'ermahgerd' no he is not oh my god that's canon thanks a lot liam we're not here so don't worry we're not having this conversation in front of her for the past 20 years you should ask like how to say 'don't fuck with me' ermahgerd kathrek kuthrek it's koothrek what is it no did you learn all of the language well tell us what you learned so that we can speak it too kuthok got it got it check it's like 'yay' only kind of weird i think probably 'do you speak common' well yeah what's her mother's name did you learn how to say 'leave us alone' that works it's the nine fucking hells nobody says please and thank you check this is great all right we should probably go uh-huh you've got to be like so cool you've got to be the coolest i know we could all die let's do this let's build dis city (sings) let's go to dis city oh shit i mean i was kind of joking but sure let's go what is this what is this creepy weird-- who dis who dat oh god wait i have a question we did a heroes' feast last night right i thought we said we were going to do it i thought we were going to do it didn't we say we were going to do it i thought we said it in the last game shit balls mother bitch fuck balls ah that's some of my favorite wood right there it should be 'ermahgerd' but whatever fight yeah we did (whispers) dis tower let's put our hoods and cloaks on weren't you going to make yourself look like a tiefling can i see if anybody is watching right now is there a-- i mean iron tower i thought you said an eye on a tower and i was like that's a different tower can i perceive anywhere that looks like where travelers would stay 30 oh crap ow ow ow ow oh my gosh good thing rubber doesn't exist here well i don't know what to do other than to-- does it look like there's anybody around us that can see us anybody watching i mean i'm glancing subtly trying to look like a badass but also stealthy 18 okay is it like that thing we ran into in-- was it kraghammer where were we where that thing was like a mash of bones and stuff is it like that okay ew you can't even see legs that seems awful wait imma put my glasses on so i can see it again oh you already closed it oh my gosh that is so creepy okay do i see anything that looks like normal exandrians people that are just like-- right i go back to our group and say well i was spotted for sure nobody seemed to pay me very much mind but there's nobody here that looks like us i don't know if we've happened to pop into a particular area of the city that is inhabited mostly by devils but that's where we are yes the market oh right oh that's true you would know i feel like we should put our hoods up and just generally act like we belong here can you do it quickly i mean-- we're in an alleyway can you just lean in front of keyleth put some mayonnaise on it you'll feel better can you imagine how sour grog must smell all the time he just has mayonnaise on him i want to be one no change it up-- stop taryon two more people (laughs) kidding he knew yeah grog can look like grog but make him more red pink no no we need to get a-- we need to eat okay well that'd-- concentration yeah and then we'll just alter self again white way to totally blend in good job rogue lillith was an albino that's why she was so pale i'm not i'm not act like you belong here act tough and cool oh no act like you belong people will buy it we just walk looking straight ahead don't look around too much the tower's in every direction i feel like only if it's called for yeah no probably not just yet i know they could but they also thrive on order and i feel like that's a little out of order me too keep doing that yeah it's concentration (gasps) maybe we can drop a little bit of dust of tracelessness behind us though so we're-- no i'm going to keep an eye out for anybody that looks like they're noticing us too much anything of course oh god that's really sad does it look like people are coming in and out of that building maybe we can post up and see or just walk on in well our surroundings are changing we're just not-- as soon as he opened the door i wanted to get a look inside of where he came out it was almost a 20 but it was a 25 fuck where's a fucking place we can have a stupid feast you need something-- they see me-- no do i see any buildings that look like people are coming in and out raucously he's going to keep an eye out for anybody watching us while i'm looking for buildings i could fly up in the air and see if i can spot a market was that what did it no it's always off to the side right how about i watch any of the people the humanoids or anything like that that are together-- can i see them talking does it look like any of them are speaking common if i'm trying to read their lips-- i'll walk in the direction just get in the area that they're in so that i can try to read their lips that's cocked (deep voice) 27 17 that was bad the fetters i still can't see what they have in the cage i'm going to walk up to them before they walk away i'm going to be casual as i do it i just walk up i don't even look at the cage at all like i don't give a shit about it and i walk up and i say-- oh are you with me i signal at you to come over i don't want to look like i'm talking to the people yet i'm just walking in their direction and i lean over to my brother and say god i hate this place don't you (exhales) it's so hot i wish we were back home right i make eye contact with the woman as i say it 30-- no 20-- 21 can i help you you were staring at me darling oh you had claimed it sorry everything here's claimed that didn't go as well as i planned (laughs) i just want to find a fucking tavern yeah but as they walk away i want to look at the fucking cage and really get a good look at what they had all right before they walk off i go oi you made a deal for that one yet where do you go i have something i'd like to sell as well it's not working i'm trying so hard (whispers) oh god yes i am whispering to you it didn't work we find other people i mean do i see a tavern around here it seems like a busy sort of street percy where are you going i follow in the general direction of those people that walked off you said they split off they split away from each other we step off to the side not the one not that one it doesn't mean it's the pit fiend ugh this is like hellraiser oh it's a buddy movie well you are quite lovely brother into the tavern it's up ahead i glance back and see them yeah i stand outside the tavern with grog and wait for everybody to get inside ohh-- (shuddering noise) oh yeah yeah yeah should we-- i just walk up i'm just going to ask for a room and just go up oh my god kuthok rooms no more keyleth no more eye contact do you have rooms available organ as he's talking i turn around and lean against the table that he's talking over and see who he's looking at well yeah but i'm going to act totally calm about it i think he might be the owner can we insight check the guy we're talking to okay sure why not here we go yeah yeah that's good 17 wait before he walks away how long have you owned this space who runs it then i'm curious big man that's all (squeaking noises) 18 let's get up to the rooms i want tary to identify it once we get up to the rooms don't don't not yet keyleth you ate a soul keyleth oh my god let's go up to the room no no tary let's go upstairs no we've got one for each of us i open up the bag of colding and just like put my face next to it no i just want to breathe in the cold wait should we all go to one room then and i want to look all around the room and see if anybody's watching if there's any kind of holes in the wall 13 yeah we were close there not yet just hold on one second maybe i'd cast identify on those just before you eat another one wow okay keyleth okay (laughs) you just ate a person you just ate people (gasps) well it was fragments so maybe it's only like five souls completely but does it heal you what do the fragments do i mean do the soul fragments just like-- -- do you just feel better are you healed or are you just not hungry anymore well we're about to have a heroes' feast back to the plan okay scry let's scry on hotis let it settle grog do you want to keep leaning against the door maybe i'm just afraid-- i feel really uncomfortable in here are there windows in the room at all okay maybe doty can lean against the door stand in front of the-- does he take fire damage okay oh shit that's kind of cool don't touch doty oh no we're going to scry on hotis it's okay it was already dead keyleth or maybe it was like the soul gems i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm kidding kidding i'm totally kidding yeah it was probably a really bad person and now they're inside of you so cast it at a higher level at what level we can be do we know if the nine hells have day and night the same way-- does this place have day and night the same way yeah but are we going to scry first yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah shit eat it hotis marisha and eat that scry oh god he is and then being stabbed by scanlan (high-pitched) rakshasa anything else anything else anything else did you see anything else or become police officers yeah yeah yeah then as soon as he wakes up-- he only stops when you kill him down here or like gilmore oh i can't even imagine hotis disguised as pike yeah we have to re-alter ourselves before we go downstairs oh i'm sure yeah i mark off 1000 gold does that mean all of our heal-- our points are healed or are we just-- oh oh that's the question i wanted to ask you did we know if here night and day is the same no that wasn't in any of his books well fingers crossed okay wow i want to throw up why are we inspired by hearing you talk all that shit about tary i don't feel inspired you know what it's getting there next time share the compliments make all of us feel cool so over this part i don't know should we rest i don't even know what time it is here it could be like early morning and we could rest and then wake up in the middle of the night but it could be a completely different time here oh that was a burp i forgot we were filming (laughs) i feel like we should just fucking try to do something well there's the owner downstairs the creepy guy oh jesus i follow wait we're not altered oh god tary can he heat up to the point that he doesn't work any more you made him after all you would know tary can you alter self again on us if we're screwed we might have to be us but you'll be out of other things you can do oh god yes you know he might do great here i haven't been doing so hot let's just send grog down yeah but everything i've tried hasn't worked so far maybe they're immune to persuasion down here and maybe all they need is a little (grunts) a little jostle let's just fucking go we're going to be okay he says he's got enough for everyone still no he can do it again to all of us it's up to you percy dear with with grog you're going with grog have fun storming the castle did he really did you take soul come back

people are going to notice all right all right how would we do that what if somebody threw a rock and hit us we're quite innocent well tary is (whispers) don't say his name freddie i wouldn't know that-- oh my god how wonderful would it be if scanlan could just dimension door-- oh i shouldn't have said his name could just dimension door down to that thing to the room and just slice up the little egg and then-- -- bamf out probably not probably what is it no scanlan (laughs) well he's not here-- like you walk through walls god i really wish we had the stones with us now yeah but-- i mean you could find your way down there no not an imp it's an insect you'll bamf into yourself oh wow i just don't think we should do that to barry i really don't feel like he is don't say our name don't whisper oh dear lord to killing an archdevil travis and could be like a pit fiend or something it won't be easy let's be honest this is going to suck you're not going to have to sign anything yeah these are the least stealthy people i think i've ever seen and we know pike he's quiet he's really quiet his boots are made of fur they're very quiet yeah oh my god can you cast locate creature right now just cast it and see let's do it because it's a level fucking four oh you're not a-- well it doesn't matter a tiefling anymore she could be a succubus those are the golden armored things was there anything else flying other than them oh god there's no window it's just wall she becomes leader of the ashari and dies as soon as she gets to hell wait are succubuses devils down here or are
