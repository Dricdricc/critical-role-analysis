this is what happens when you get half the cast in a session together oh man yeah on tuesday i think it was tuesday we finally got to admit i got to say that i was in gears of war 4 (cheering) any idea i know i'd already had a bunch of messages on twitter but i couldn't confirm them until the 8th and i finally can travis and but in conjunction with that liam mcintyre who is one of-- he also leads in the game-- i know right i already like him because his name is liam but and i also like him because he's a nerd and i say this because he just started a kickstarter for a card game that he developed called monster lab so if you guys want to check it out it's really really cute it's really really fun i think it's been going for like 15 days they're doing really well on the kickstarter but now they're going for stretch goals so monster lab they're so cute hey look at this beautiful box no no well that's true but we used it right away and we got here 20 minutes earlier than him solid announcement do you know about those you should use waze (laughter) it's a lake so we know it's relatively close we should probably head there i feel like we need to we told-- we keep changing places and nobody's going to know where we are pike is in whitestone how do we let her know we're moving or are we coming back here to the loch let's leave word at the slayer's take that we're heading out so if you know allura or pike shows up wanting to find us-- so wait a couple days and then we're heading out i thought we were heading out now are you coming with us well can we wait a day to the loch okay i feel like we're missing something wait you're trying to get us passage to the back-- or are you trying to get us to the lake i'm so confused this is out of character i literally don't have an idea what's going on here's the thing also our lady keyleth the beautiful princess that lives among us she has a way she can travel us very very quickly through trees so we don't actually need passage so unless we're getting supplies and we need to travel with a lot of things then you know we don't actually need passage do you think that this is going to lead to some serious fighting because it sounds like these vestiges are well-guarded i'm sure you know what grog that's an excellent point hanging on a tree branch under the lake roll a 20 and add it to your history so 11 well we just loaded up on a bunch of potions some dickhead let's try it well we're not going to get there before dark so maybe we should sleep here tonight and start out in the morning maybe the slayer's take knows more about the lake about these vest-- no these are pretty secret i think the vestiges are a pretty well-kept secret people aren't going to just know where they are i wonder if somebody knows about a cavern under the lake or maybe we need to breathe under-fricking-water is there a library nearby i've got a pretty decent investigation you and me brother all right 23 is somebody watching me at the moment are we just perusing a bookstore or-- i sit down on the ground and start reading through the book and see if i can find information oh hi i keep reading oh i thought this was a library of course well can i just check and make sure that it's actually got any information that i need because if it doesn't then i don't want to buy it you understand all right of course yes are you just going to stand there and watch me peruse then well i just start looking for what i need i just don't know i can't really tell if it actually has anything interesting what's the back that's 30 gold 30 gold it's so dusty though i mean is that even worth it if it's this dusty 30 gold does it have spells in it no oh oh no i hold onto it well i know people that you know care about dirty old books so i guess i mean i might be willing to purchase it for them but they usually like things in mint condition when they buy their antiques this has a damaged spine i see it and yellowing of the pages and it seems like somebody's bookmarked this one oh this is the worst haggling ever what's your name (groaning) 18 i feel hurt and i pull out 30 gold and i say i suppose-- (weakly) i'll buy it damn it it hurts it hurts me in my soul it is actually the first time i kind of respect you i'm a little impressed benjamin cole you're a dear (cackles) yeah he was not on the anniversary matt not on the anniversary there's definitely going to be ghosts there kashaw do your holy shit when we go there all right oh really is it not like sarenrae sarenrae is that your god you're married to a god wait you're married and you-- good times i want to hear more about this not in vasselheim grog how could you my brother best friends forever (gasps) we're off you know what that's true all right i just think outside of vasselheim you know things come out at night but whatever if you guys think this is the most brilliant decision i'm on board so much wisdom keyleth can't you turn us all to mist and then we poof there then we could be there before the evening can you mist walk us all including trinket horses would die out there yay let's do it (ghost noises) we probably should have talked out our plan before we did this we can talk in mist form that's awesome from above could i see any sort of caverns or openings in the ground or something that looked like caves that's what i was keeping my eye out for as we went 22 is what i rolled okay is this technically-- are we in the woods is this my favored terrain again how do we stop being like this should we turn like people again tell trinket to turn like a bear oh can we talk normal oh tell him i love him killer (gasps) can we mist underwater can farts travel underwater that's kind of cool or we'll drown thank you grog can i go hit the place where grog hit his head and see if i can crack a hole in the ice this is going to suck and i put my head underwater to see if i can look around oh shit oh with disadvantage doesn't it count as disadvantage by destroying the rest of my dice perception that is a 31 no 41 yeah 31 what (gasps coughs) it's down there oh it's so cold my poor little feathers are like poo how deep does it look oh good good is there any way-- because i have this horrible feeling that we're going to get underwater and then we won't be able to get out because it's covered in ice can we melt the ice can you do something walk carefully i feel like we should we didn't rest we're idiots let's camp-- oh god i'm going to try to mist down and just see if i can i'm concentrating on making myself a fart he's doing it too can we go in as gas i go back up oh killer let's try to set up camp in the trees so we're not on the ground any sign of her kash oh natural 20 maybe keyleth can find out something with your tail (yelps) did it seem like a perfect circle zahra or was it jaggedy how soft was the ground when you dug into it it was softer than the rest of the ground sounds to me like a creature that would burrow do i know of any creatures that are underwater-- is it like the worms that we encountered before it's possible it's a creature that's burrowing or it's possible that's an opening into our underwater cavern and nothing can grow there you're going underwater now it's freezing cold she's really attractive now isn't she that shark huh (laughter) sounds like a creature (laughs) pucker point we should settle down to sleep as we're settling down to sleep i make sure that trinket is laying between kash and keyleth always yeah trinket keep keyleth warm she's cold she was in the water you need to rest you got beat up you go to sleep i'm going to stay up for a little bit because i'm fine we climb up in the tree and keep watch it's difficult trinket's very thankful oh shit he went to bed i was awake it's okay i'm good 34 trinket-sized furry entities i can't see if they're actually bears i cast pass without a trace on everyone around me and i stealth we're already stealthed 24 owlbears let's just watch them we just sit and enjoy this magical moment of seeing the rare owlbear in person did they leave any feathers behind after they get away i want to climb down and gather the feathers that they left behind okay i want to fletch an arrow owlbear arrows oh shit really you know those ones i have okay i have thieves' tools because i'm a thief now i stole them dude matt told me i have thieves' tools dick 27 27 dexterity shut up these are special cool shut up i'm writing two owlbear arrows oh i warn them there's owlbears in the area before i go to sleep ah fuck you i have pass without a trace cast on us-- shitballs (laughter) it's the cow-roc when we were cows when we saved a roc oh shit percy you've seen it mary and i elbow him you're snoring a-fucking-gain-- i wake up can you guys talk a little quieter some of us are sleeping i guess we should breathe underwater and head down right extended period i can well i have really good perception so i can go down and see if i can find an opening that you guys didn't see yesterday could you like make a you know parting of the red sea sort of thing try that oh that's good useful that could be useful if something was attacking and they wouldn't attack fish i'll run in search around we'll all run in search around like maniacs for ten minutes let's do it and run down and search i feel like that's killing a lot of wildlife keyleth i have total faith in you you know what i'm running in and keyleth just be ready to throw it away i run in and start looking for anything i'm going to that and seeing if there's something there i go to the hole to the ahnus and start looking oh i just stepped right in because i'm really smart you guys hold onto me i'm going i'm sinking grog grog help seriously quick come on come on grog help i take out my rope of infinite twine and throw it to trinket's mouth from far away pull me out this sucks you guys grog why are you being a dick-fuck i need to get out of this mud seriously great use keyleth we found an entrance point ish you're not going to even help cool seriously we're dying we're going to die yes please get us out with bigby can you scoop out all the mud in that fucking hole that just tried to kill us once we're in and water's covering it we're not going to be able to get these stones away oh that's true if something happens you can put it up hey you know what we're not doing anything for you you fuck 'cause you didn't even try to help us we didn't even talk about how it's our one-year anniversary-- that is paper oh my gosh it's so beautiful mine too is yours just you 'cause mine is just me and pike we can show it and this is artwork by wendy baby baby creatures (sing imperial march) (all warble imperial march) we're moving-- but we should probably i don't know stealth i don't know what would be alive down here but there might be undead actually can i take a moment and use primeval awareness and sense if there's any undead entities around any ghostly or undead zombies anything undead aberrations let's start with undead up to six miles one thing i cast pass without a trace on the group can we stealth oh that's true we are really camouflaged no add ten to it 28 you know what i bet if they live in the dark light will blind them guess what there's fish people up ahead can you see us we can't see anything should we get some light i have a question in my book that i bought for 30 gold did it mention what level of the multi-level tomb the champion was buried on i got played it was a worthless 30 gold then vax can you guys keep it down i can hear you from here is it a dead end so it's a wall in front of you do you see any openings down there shit wait wait you're going down into the snotty-- it's really fucking dark i want to keep an eye out for any traps or anything i want to look for any imperfections in the stairs that look like they could collapse at any time or they could be unsafe 28 for me can i crouch down and look at it and see what it is do they look like the owlbear feathers that i picked up earlier hey keyleth have you ever seen feathers like this why were they covered in goo fuck the raven queen right that makes sense thank you you guys ravens yeah oh was i supposed to still be at disadvantage 26 does it look like traps you want to perceive them wow you're really smart can i perceive around and see if i see any switches or anything that would turn them off this wouldn't be underdark-y at all would it then i rolled a ten someone with little gnome hands maybe so it's wide enough for your fingers i pat his little head as i walk through the blades not his cube just the top of his head (laughter) walk quietly dear you have a-- wait you can fly i could maybe try to leap from the sides of the hole or something i could totally parkour that (whispering) i think we should go down can we look down can we just look down three that little ledge won't support-- i mean is it a long hallway that ends abruptly or is it this much space i drop something down into-- a rock that i find-- and drop it down into the hole (long pause) it's pretty deep guys can i since it's only five feet away on the left can i look around and see if it looks like there's any similar sort of traps or anything down that hallway i hop over to the doors too 31 you rolled for trinket (gasps) oh my god can i leap forward and try to grab him trinket turns and puts his claws into grog's hand good to know you can jump at all are your hands okay are the doors locked are there traps on the door i check for traps 16 (door squeaking sound) i push oh good more darkness like a platform like a tomb can i stealth i want to stealth and perceive-- i'm going to like step in 20 oh 30 because of pass without a trace which is still on us (whispers) there's definitely creatures in here i don't know if they're hostile (whispers) can i just shoot an arrow i do (gasps) ohh i forgot wait (gasps) shh (whispers) they know we're here obviously you threw a fucking rock they want to fight us-- whatever it is they're protecting-- this champion's-- you want me to just yell it out cool hey there's people on the other fucking side and they're going to attack us when we walk in here they're saying to defend his fucking tomb sam and i'm stealthing to the side i want to get up and meet him at a-- i use my earring and i whisper they're calling to their master something big i stay stealthed rolled stealth yeah everybody still has pass without a trace was i supposed to roll stealth at all on that 35 21 uh huh-- nine ten-- awesome i'm going to-- ooh is this sneak attack because i'm stealthed oh okay i'm going to cast lightning arrow on the guy in the middle 'cause everything within ten feet is hit oh you know what i was using those little blocks as feet marks-- is that it wouldn't get the two guys down-- okay so let's do the middle guy and-- yeah aw man which one which one let's do this-- that's 30 30 no 28 lightning arrow is 4d8 lightning damage okay 27 plus sneak attack 29 15 okay 13 i'm going to move-- yeah i'm going to move behind that wall there yeah trinket is going to-- move-- i don't know where that is-- move behind the pillar can he get there maybe yes yeah cool no sneak attack i thought you said it didn't get sneak attack-- that's better (gasps) no (muffled) oh my god you i don't remember all the things i don't remember all the things oh no got it got it got it good to know (gasps) oh my god is she unconscious or is she awake oh no okay she's alive six seven your ranged attack bonus 11 6d12 holy crap girl okay am i-- can it see me in its eye would i be in its thingy i'm going to move stealthily along the wall so i can maybe be out of that thing can i be fuckin' shit bitch am i hiding am i still hidden no i don't want to do that i just want to make my motion hide behind a pillar maybe yeah i appreciate it my pouches are still pretty heavy i'm going to hold my action until he's looking away from me and i want to move trinket behind the wall so now when it looks down at us does it change the direction of the cone add your inspiration add your inspiration whenever you need it but you have an inspiration dice here that's good so you're at 18 where did the beam come out of where's the eye where's the phantom eye just do it can i ask a technical question if i've held my action until he does something and he never does it do i ever get to go i just hold it until the end of the turn it's good to know i'm gambling that away if-- i didn't do hunter's mark on purpose because i can't do any magic on him because he's looking at me say 'screw it' 12s you need 20s for attacks plus your attack modifier oh no i don't think so i use my action since that's the end of it right i pop out and i shoot two arrows at him (grunts) that's it just like (groans) because of my bracers no i know but my bracers only add to damage four to damage why four well this one is 29 20 yeah oh god that's pathetic five ten everybody's hiding oh that's right he can't attack anything within his own cone i am going to-- (scoffs) if i run back to where i was standing am i out of its fricking cone all right i'm going to do that (laughter) all right back to all my magical stuff all right i'm going to shoot from my sky sentinel at him that's my first attack for that and that is 22 for the first arrow because it splits 20 no that was wrong no that's right oh that was weird 16 okay so that adds 1d6 to my damage with those okay balls eight nine ten 16 for the first 14 for the second and then my second attack i want to shoot through my blazing bowstring at it 17 oh no that wasn't one of my owlbear arrows for sure i'm going to duck behind the wall right there if i can no okay i push trinket out and make him run around and hide behind the other wall (laughter) i love you move he's got 40 so technically he could make it behind that other wall what the-- everything at the walls anything hiding this is our spot i duck so he can shoot me it can see me okay 21 yeah 14 kill him grog 36 for the first me i was taking a snapsnot it didn't make any sense at all fuck okay 24 23 it's 23 kill him keyleth mmm i shouldn't say it do you get to stay as an earth elemental if you're right in front of him they don't work in front of him right they're magic okay zahra you're going to get him i can feel it those are all 12s yes times two-- 70 i immediately call out help kash i run to look over the edge to take care of kima too i'm pulling the rope out and trying to lower it over the edge if you'd gone down there i would've jumped right down there look for any loot i'm trying to-- brother i'm going to go look at the stuff that they're finding okay be safe and i run over to the sarcophagus (laughs) all good kima it's infinite rope can we perception check the tomb and see if it's safe to grab shit out of it one for trinket six for trinket it's a good night you guys i'm unconscious trinket-- yeah i'm going to throw up oh no (whispered) that's good that's good what happened i feel so cold knocked out (sighs) well that was a close one (laughs) did we find anything (exaggerated sobbing) god why are you crying what happened what all right all right your breath is lovely okay how did i-- i feel-- i feel cold how am i not dead then if i died-- (softly) vax-- wait percy did you set off a trap is that how i died (laughing nervously) well-- who brought me back oh oh yes yeah yeah give me some of that it'll warm me up we need to get those-- those leathers those vestiges or whatever and get the-- out of here can we not-- can we investigate it and see if there's any traps i mean how do we make sure it doesn't happen again thank you dear we need rest i feel like we should maybe camp and sleep and rest up and get-- i don't know it's up to you guys okay (whispers) thank you zahra want to kill it both of you yes we'll meet you in whitestone we could all head that way
