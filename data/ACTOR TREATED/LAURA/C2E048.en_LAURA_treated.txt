invisible person in the chair i'm going to sit in the chair and see what i see what does it look like from the chair like maybe this old dodecahedron down here not here wait rumors we squashed by spreading a batch of molded fruit crop kryn that's what they actually are (gasps) blah blah blah extremely difficult to work with attempts to isolate a substance capable containing and sustaining the dunamantic energies within a casing has proven both time-consuming and costly-- you have some of the same stuff wait look-- i don't know in these past weeks we have successfully distilled a single vial that should enable a temporary influx of dunamis to even an untrained soldier once i can remove the beacon itself from the process i hope to have this alchemist produce a number of batches over the next 12 to 16 months refining the method with each step until we can certify its use in combat is that your friend the alchemist listen listen word has found me of trent finding a few of his proteges have a knack for early dunamancy-- blah blah something something i am eager to look over their findings and perchance fold these skills into my own imagine-- something something --could be accomplished by the assembly should we further learn to command these-- there's so many things i can't read because it's burned away --existence the dreams are already thrilling you don't they're going to be so pissed when they find out we have that thing oh no that's going to be way harder to cover up we can put the foldable tripod-- we have a bag of holding oh that's right why should we break the chair we need to get out of here let's go quickly no i just saw the room was there anything under the chair on the underside of the chair go go do we need to clean up caleb's puke will somebody be able to find us with his puke not here no it's staying in the bag don't worry you need somewhere-- we can send a message anytime yeah my mama-- you sneaky motherfucker i can't wait to interrogate you
