taliesin you're so loud it's so loud what are you doing david bowie labyrinth is that giving something away i feel like we gave spoilers oh that's true never mind yeah we leave early tomorrow morning good times aw that's awesome shoot you're shooting your gun be percy oh you fall over she's healing him pew pew and then i'll go oh then i wink at you and then i shoot another one at you [actual intro plays] we need to trap the dragon obviously on the ground is there how would you do that what about blacksmiths in town are there any blacksmiths left can we help him at all he took three hours doing that i'm an expert on dragons what do you mean shut up 17 where's the gland located would i know that like in his throat it would be instantaneous at least oh getting fancy now scanlan shorthalt the armor that i took from him well-- are you here are you next-- are you next to me now it's the armor that i won fair and square from him yes i am wearing it right now it is scanlan that's going to cost you a lot of money you think your little armor will fit me what kind of armor do you have which is cold resistant i doubt that what is it is it plus two okay well sweet then yeah sure give it to me strip on down there scanlan no you first i want to see the cube and then i'll give you my armor there's no time for that i try really hard not to start laughing that's a good question do you want to walk away for this i completely ungracefully take it off and throw it at you give me that armor how is this going to fit me i'm just naked trying to squirm into these extra-skinny jeans what color is it is it beautiful does it match my storm bow you might not be getting this back scanlan wait why did you need to change-- are you going to be up close and personal with him well yes but this was a really stupid-- why did i give that up now you're not here are you planning on doing something as long as you're not melted from all the acid can i be talking to zanror i bring zanror a big tankard of ale and sit down in front of him matt oh good to see you yeah zanror did i hear you correctly before that you have been the one speaking with the beast in the past so when it comes and gathers its treasure it stops and talks or does it just come and take it and leave so if the treasure looked different this time it might stop and talk about it i'm curious because i know you said you are lacking in gold and treasure what will entice the beast what if we had a way of providing some gold and maybe you provide an offering of a different kind what if you say that your father kevdak had been plotting against the dragon and you found out about it would you be able to offer his body and the body of his allies as tribute to the dragon dragons are vain well we may be able to get that back how are you planning on hiding your fellow warriors from the dragon so as not to attract its attention because we may have some ideas okay a dragon's lair is not-- we wouldn't do much damage to it there in fact it's probably laid several traps against us already what if we could trap it onto the ground here we have a wonderful tinkerer quite talented and he's creating something to trap the dragon plus we can provide several chains once it's on the ground maybe your very strong goliaths could try to snare it grappling-hook it throw some chains up and over well hopefully it would only be needed for a small amount of time before our magic users have their way with it and now turn it back keyleth ah ah no strings once it's on the ground if we can pull it down enough she may be able to lock its legs into the stone i like how we're walking through all of these ideas and none of it's going to work when we get there surprise very lightly it was pretty great the only thing i'm worried about zanror is that if this ugly beast flies in and sees oh how many of your men do you have 25 men standing around don't you think it's going to be a little curious as to why all of the sudden-- all of a sudden there's a large number of people around that's never been there before it'll be super shallow just enough that they can come on up and out not a lot is going to get a dragon shaking in its claws a surprise attack is going to be one of our best shots at grounding this thing we want it to land then we strike we just want it to hit the fucking ground some gold to give the stallion that mounts the world for sure so we really need to dig a trench around the area that the treasure is going to be when you dig the trench can i use my perception and my ranger ability to camouflage things and make sure that from above the ground from the height that the dragon will be looking at it that it's not seeable at all i don't want this trap to be seen-- i guess i should wait until we find out if percy finishes his trap and gets it in place to do all of this i know hide in plain sight is for myself but i feel like as a ranger i'd be able to hide tracks and stuff we can use a little dust of tracelessness or something i know all of these things all of a sudden no he said if we're going to do it make sure it is hidden i don't know if i wrote it down he was the guy who saved us he saved us when the white dragon came to westruun oh shit give him food grog oh no have we met old davin quick answer it hi percy look for noja's book look for noja's book what's up grog dabdrist cojo are you with us pike pike's with us hey what's up you want to help us clear some stuff search around help him search oh god roll really good she's super busy brother so busy (gagging) is that still there including your grandad oh he went away aw this is just not-- okay well at least he started did you guys make out was it really fun lots of making out there i understand you have him on your mind you can't get our names straight do you still think you're talking to my brother i turn around and see him is he just standing there um hey hey what are you doing are you coming to help us or are you just standing in the middle-- do you want to help build i don't know a trench set a trap what time is it we haven't even started digging the trench yet what fucking time is it we're not there come on did he work all the way through the night oh god there's more we have to do we need to get fassbender into the middle where the treasure's going to be you're speaking my language how many arrows can you do that do thanks i really enjoyed the idea of that it can be maybe in a chest above fassbender 'cause he's going to be buried and then it can be triggered maybe when the dragon lifts it up 20 feet is really big oh my god you know what you could do you could make a trigger if he gets a certain height off the ground and that way if he's over 20 feet above the ground then it triggers and he's the only thing that would get affected what if it gets above a certain feet in the air can it trigger then i thought it meant if the glyph lifted in the air but it might be better if he lands and then we spring the trap it could be a thing if he tries to leave it explodes would i know is a black dragon-- does it have any weaknesses it has no weaknesses what about fassbender is he immune to any damage can we fuse some chains into fassbender so that he can be attached to the ground ready to go (squishing) two big ones all right these are heavy wait where are we putting it you take left i'll take right where do we attach these chains to the ground just ten why can't it be 15 feet below the surface when are we going to set the trap that percy made why this creepy music because the fucking dragon's going to see us right now fassbender will lay on top of the trap right he can't lay under the trap you want to sing me some inspiration 31 little dust of tracelessness make it look like there's treasure on it i take some of the gold that we have and-- a thin layer where it looks like a lot of gold but it's really just a thin layer of gold over top of rocks grog question we sort of thought maybe we could use kevdak as a tribute like we sacrificed him to the great shitty umbrasyl is that his name but it doesn't quite have the same effect without his head do you still have that head in fact i think i might have the head did i put it in my bag of cold would that be all right with you grog don't you want to kill this dragon grog i don't have the head i only have the gross bear tattoo off kevdak grog i can tell when you're lying you're lying grog can we maybe-- you'll be able to get it back because we're going to kill this dragon and then you can just go and pick up the head and keep it again in your bag of holding so we can make it seem like we sacrificed kevdak to the dragon well what do you want to be bait grog there's exploding things around here are you sure you want to be in this area i promise we're going to hide in the trenches yes and the trench is all around that they are covered there on the other side you want to be able to get there right away on surprise attack spring right out of the ground as soon as that trap triggers no i feel like they've gotta burst out yeah we need to have a feast what is it instead of shooting arrows why can't you keep your boots on for that does it have to be attuned no i can't wear the circlet dude that's good i can take off my bracers of archery too and put something on-- they just give me a plus two to damage rolls all right give me the boots i'm putting the boots on and abjurist noja we need to sleep will that last for 24 hours he comes normally around noon he said we need to go the fuck to sleep set our alarm clocks did you use your tongues they know the plan as soon as he lands on the ground everybody springs up and-- the trap should go (snapping) get up and out yeah regardless i'm sure it'll be pretty loud there might also be an explosion you used it before yeah the guy showed up oh really i thought that was divine intervention that made the guy show up i cast pass without a trace on all of us thanks i'm going to be up in a tree yeah no i'm going to be in a different tree can i use my perception to see how hidden everything is yeah something far i think percy wanted to be in a tree too at a distance yes like the trees are 80 feet away from the stuff okay i hide the hole everyone knows they need to not move at all and be completely-- you're right we need to be stealthy up in the trees not yet what did you roll 22 am i first he has fassbender i guess i'm just going to shoot it i mean what else can i do right now all right my boots of haste have been clicked badass i'm going to hunter's mark him wait yeah because i'm still hidden in the tree right okay i'm going to hunter's mark him i'm going to shoot him with my longbow of the sky sentinel so i'm going to roll advantage okay so the first one is 12 plus 15 is 23 27 25 and 23 so okay those are regular attack plus lightning arrow attack right i all of a sudden forget how it works plus 1d6 per arrow 1d6 for the hunter's mark and then 1d6 on the first one for the sneak attack okay plus the regular 31 on the first arrow yes 12 plus nine right i know i lost my-- 18 i think 18 was the last one that was my first attack for my second attack i'm going to shoot him with one of my dragon arrows should i waste it on him i have two of them i've been saving one but i'm going to use one on him this is still advantage because it's still surprise round right okay 24 okay that's still my hunter's mark and then-- i have a jelly belly in my thing-- and then that's 10d6 additional damage for the dragon arrow oh okay so an additional 10d6 damage for the dragon arrow no 6d10 sorry my mistake 6d10 (counting) sorry 24 plus ten is 34 plus hunter's mark is another four 38 on that attack and then my third attack i'm going to use the blazing bowstring do i still get advantage because i'm still hidden 20 20 okay wow i'm going to sink down into the leaves yes and try to hide better okay i'm trying to duck behind some branches so he doesn't have direct line of sights on me okay some of them can try to like swing the grapplings around the ankles-- oh no what are we looking up we're literally going to finish off this bag of jelly bellies at what level 4d6 plus two more d6 yeah she did i gave him as much information as i could is it advantage because i told him where it would be i'm up oh my god okay i'm going to cast conjure animals and i'm going to conjure two giant eagles right in front of his face (laughs) sorry matt i'm sorry okay okay right in front of-- and conjure animals is an action or a-- okay i'm going to tell them to attack his eyes they get their own-- you sent me a thing-- let's go with that hold up giant eagle dexterity is 17 plus three and then for my bonus action i'm going to-- i can't cast two spells even if one's a bonus action oh okay for my bonus action i'm going to hide a lot i'm going to hide i wasn't still hidden can i attempt to hide but on my boots of haste i can use it to dash disengage or hide okay my extra action natural 20 wow these guys hit real hard how come they were hitting us so hard what about the trap is he out of the trap then too are they all going to die the birds were up in the air though 15d8 oh my god you guys we're going to die good job you fucking wastes of space they didn't even get to fucking go what level are you casting it at yeah so that's only two you used 4d6 plus an additional two or three thanks matt thank you for pointing that back out but it can't very well avoid it you get a d8 plus your d6 then you did the additional 3d6 and you only got 15 do i get advantage on attacking it because of guiding bolt i've got to see because i just want to know how far does grasping vine go do you know keyleth how high in the air is-- i'm going to-- can it go from the bottom of the pillar up towards him yeah i want to try to grasp onto one of his legs and yank him back down towards the ground ooh which would really hurt with the immovable rod inside of him i have two because i have a pearl of power okay oh i didn't tell you i should have yeah um 16 that was my bonus okay then i'm going to attack him three times with my hasting all right okay 24 okay and that's sneak attack because he's got somebody close to him inside of him cool then just seven-- ten for the first attack then it doesn't hit then 26 for the last one nine the grasping vine just still hangs out there am i hiding still ugh fine are they just the stupidest goliaths that they're all clumping together again these guys are dumb no where's zanror where's his wife i thought a ton was 3000 pounds okay i'm going to try conjure fucking animals again by the way i was wrong my pearl of power only works up to level three so i don't have two level fours i already used the one so conjure animals again two more giant eagles out of the ether this time i want to conjure them like ten feet above his head oh she knocked out a pillar on the way down okay so they're above his head now so if he shoots acid down they'll be here and their command is attack his eyeballs okay i'm going to use my boots of haste for my perception would i be able to see any weird little bumps on the dragon because my brother's been in there a while can i see anything going on i'm sorry 28 no 29 perception i'm going to aim right by there but not quite at it i want to make an opening around it 20 doesn't hit oh it hits oh my goodness ten damage he's getting my hopes up and then he's going to dash them down to the ground that one doesn't work either (mock-crying) okay that's good 23 okay 11 how do i want to do this (laughter) dammit he's only six feet tall yeah 20 feet you're probably 20 feet i bet that hits i'm sure that probably kills him he's got six points left they're going to fly and attack his eyeballs fuck him up roll four attacks that's good that hits that one doesn't ooh then one other attack hits so those would be like one beak and one talon maybe nine for one on the eyeballs and eight on the talons eyeballs that's cool okay good to know oh no what do you guys think would you rather wait two weeks i mean this is you guys too you guys have to stay i feel like that's smarter that went south that went seriously south no that is so terrible don't say that no
