good in the house it's so perfect it's going to go on the mantle (sings) that was ariel singing little mermaid keep singing thanks brother thank you so much i don't have your gift for you here make him hold it thank you that's so wonderful don't steal it trinket you won't fit on it of course but we'll bring him home then we'll find your grandfather or we can take him home and meet you does any of this look familiar to you darling yeah and your grandfather lives in this area as well i pat trinket's butt it's okay oh be careful i walk up behind hello is anyone home it's relatively safe--er than it was knock-knock we have your son safe and sound special delivery for child's mum of course well no darling put that away truly put that away and not even slightly dead oh yeah he killed the bad guy i think it's paint i think it might be paint they were painting quite an adventure have you-- sorry have you seen a small elderly-- an older gnome yes have you seen him is he all right all right yes trained in it that's sick a fun trip (whispering) one last question this is it i swear are you familiar with anyone in the farming area just outside of town we're looking for a woman who was a daughter of one of the gentlemen that worked in the fields and we really have no idea how to go about finding her reginald's daughter yes all right you know where to find us we'll be about i know i mean good thing he never died you have a secret knock you maybe used he might have very soft footfalls he's barricaded the door that's a good thing that's a really good thing i go and look through the window is there a window what do you see oh well pike after you pike did he have any hiding places like that other house 18 percy wilhand he knows us grog yes well of course they did who hasn't heard the legend of wilhand the seven seas perfect perfect in what way leaving or fighting the dragon we really should have a conversation about that pike's going to be so fucked up finish the bottle you know what we should do bring him into the mansion you can show his people that work at the mansion how to cook 'cause they are terrible i can tell you that much he's been drunk the whole time wait where are we going oh right master quall it's true it's true i mean it could be one of the best times to attack is there anything you want to bring with you he's your uncle i thought he was your grandfather (whispers) and he's super interested in her yeah we walk and talk it's at the fountain crossroads-- percival well honestly isn't the dragon going to come pick up its loot in the next couple days it's happening tomorrow i'm glad we have a mansion to hide in they're not good people they killed a lot of innocents it's possible we can wait for all of the goliaths and other barbarians to attack the dragon and when they all leave the city we bar them out take the city back well the dragon could be content fighting them we take the time and get everyone else out of the city on the other hand-- --when are we going to have a better opportunity to kill a fucking dragon than with 40 giant strapping-- we can't leave the people in this city under the rule of any more of these monsters we have to get people out will they after they ransack everything again how do we get everyone out and he'll come find us but we can't kill all of them at the same time it's got to be a one-by-one process the white one that we killed or the white one that we also saw yeah that one was real bad yeah but all those guys they were i mean they had strong attacks what if we put out the loot let him come down and get it and then we throw big ropes up and over him or something will they dragons are vain how do you know they won't just find that dragon weak and think that he's not worthy of them-- does it look like it's been ransacked at all i do have a coin with a 20 and a one on it are we going-- silently quietly walking up to the front door it's already partially ajar of course brother d'you want me to look around from out here i can actually walk in all right i stand exactly in front of the door and don't take any more steps i look for traps visually oh well give us just a moment yeah but that's a good idea 24 there's stairs we're at the bottom of the stairs are there doors in this main-- it's like a foyer all right ohh trinket dear come on come on d'you want to go in the locket you do if you don't you can wait out here but it's probably safer in the locket don't be sad about it if you don't want to i'm not going to make you ooh i love him so much what was it like grog can we check out the stairs and make sure nothing's wrong with the stairs oh i did not see anything i'm going to stand here and watch you do it actually oh what are you fucking kidding me right now you're a moron d'you want to get your whole body in there what are shitty pillows was that fun was that fu-- i'm looking i'm checking out those stairs too i wouldn't have slid down the fucking slide i would assume that leads to death i don't need to throw a pillow down the slide to know-- no 21 dick (laughter) can we read it do we understand it the carpet maybe scanlan has an idea what it is scanlan you know this rune over here this little glowy rune right here look closely i go get a pillow and i throw it at the rune how'd it work does that is that how you're supposed to do it so wait wait wait the last time you saw runes like this you lost the carpet how did you lose the carpet so it might disenchant whatever we have on us well how do we make it not burn us who can undo magical thingies whoa oh what is it what was it if it was bad it doesn't count but if it's good it does good job pike i thought we could skip over that one step and then there was up yeah yeah we can jump over that little gap hmm all right i get on the broom and i float on up to that landing and i look and see if there's any traps on the ground without setting foot on it i don't know you're pretty heavy you might fit-- (gasps) it's nothing to brag about scrawny minus two i am equally scrawny (laughter) dangle well onto the bottom you can hang off the bottom of it (spitting sound) don't fucking let go obviously ooh master quall was a little freaky i think can we look under the bed 17 can i look under the bed i check for traps on the chest 26 i try to open it it's locked it's locked open it open it do you want me to try to pick this lock because i am very talented as a rogue well then fine i'll try to unlock it is this how you hold it this is how you hold it then 24 24 is that saving throws or regular okay yeah 24 hey look at that thank you all the gold all the gold ugh why would he take the shit out and then lock it and put it back under the bed what a douche i did i did i checked i was saying it i said i'm checking all around the fucking chest that's what i said oh my god it's a key you know what we're going to get downstairs and this key is going to unlock the thing that has the circlet i know it what i love you yeah because it's fun i'm sorry who's talking who is this i double-check the room for-- what would you like me to look for again i rolled a one nothing else to find i found the key dammit yeah we checked all the rooms we checked the other room already hop on the broom you can sit sidesaddle hey i like this plan (whispers) look percy i found a key what did you just do trinket's in my locket but do you want trinket with you 25 (whispers) hey pike do you think you can try dispelling magic again because there's some shimmery sort of shit on this door and i don't trust it what if i stick it in and i turn it and it explodes and i die oh i don't know that's never happened before-- shit oh your invisible servant yeah go do that let's all step back step way back back it up back it up what i'm holding the key up to mort i don't know where he is hey maybe yeah i walk through the gust of wind and get my hair tousled sorry mort can i look around for a fucking circlet 16 yes that looks very similar a golem that was up in the wall how about we tie its legs up just like we did before just in case he comes alive then he can trip and fall i don't care i start tying a rope around his legs yeah yeah yeah yeah so we fought this other thing because of quall well because that's what he does he wanted the orb to bring this thing to life if i take a step forward does he look like it has any kind of reaction i'm going to keep trying to tie around his legs all right well i feel safer really can you try to look at its chest it has a little blue glimmer in it climb down and look and see if you can-- just look and see what it is can i see if the golem's wearing a circlet we should keep looking anybody else want to look around the room for the circlet well we have the thing including the golem oh yeah yeah yeah oh shit oh wait his legs are tied up-- he looked like a moron that was amazing i'm on the ground laughing 21 what i rolled how do we get him out i don't know okay yeah i pop trinket out it says a creature no more than large in size so no i walk up he's not going to hit me is he keyleth spike i don't know i just liked the name can he talk why can he put his finger down and i hold the locket up hey fassbender nope no luck oh that's good but i think he moves rather slow how fast can he run well he's rather loud let me see how many spells i have left i think i do yeah i can do pass without a trace i have a couple left i'm going to cast pass without a trace on all of us including the golem this thing is awesome that's true he actually might be able to hold onto it at least for a little bit so the dragon could probably like fly away with it wait can he get through the mansion door oh god we'll show you what he looks like in the mansion i see you're wearing the gauntlets grog yay what do you want help probably should've brought a ranger with you i'm really good at tracking is that what you said oh my god did you send your daughter down to get attacked by a giant bulbous shit you guys are lost forever in the sewers (laughs) who doesn't that's a lie because i said spike you're healed you're healed up do we know if we can heal him once we damage him ping you can-- oh no how do we fix him oh no oh no just think the fun thing is i think you're aging much slower than the rest of us that's cool that's cool ooh i wonder if it can like earthquake nice try taking it off kiki i am going to throw something at you do you have identify do you have identify i'm asking you not you wait that's damage well fucking hand 'em over we'll sell 'em for stuff grog i don't trust your haggling skills i promise we should probably figure out if we're going to fight a fucking dragon in the morning oh gods we're going to go talk to him tonight we need to sleep what library here the cobalt reserve yes and we still haven't found reginald's daughter oh she's in prison let's go sleep now wake up go let the prisoners free and then talk to kev-- zanror short short talk i am-- i stand by what i said before i think we should let them go out and fight a dragon and we try to rescue the city while they are distracted are there any big trees in the city an entire fucking city a little (whispers) i think that went well we should eat and then sleep i go and whisper to scanlan are you all right she didn't i sort of meant about kaylie as well though yes of course she is and then we don't really fight well we see how they do and we try to rescue people no i'm not separating from you when we go fight a giant fucking dragon what does he say you speak of pride of listening to reason might be smart to listen to reason in this instance as well that dragon is ancient and very large it's quite possible he'll wipe out all of us the town included it might be smart to swallow our pride for the day and prepare come back when we have preparations made and we can take the dragon down how many people do you have with you vex'ahlia why saving throws our tiny people are pretty fucking powerful we killed a white dragon motherfucker aye how many do you have left after they left 25 something that explodes it something that traps it (sings) he doesn't need it acid yes you'll release the prisoners we totally planned at dawn (laughter) oh shit it's like pilot season oh god
