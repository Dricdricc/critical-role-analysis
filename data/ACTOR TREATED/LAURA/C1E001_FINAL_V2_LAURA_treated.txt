anything that looks edible you can eat it it's fine just kidding oh so he's fine shit oh our comments cards that's right like so many half-elves vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence vex'ahlia and her twin brother vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief while vex kept to the woods she preferred the isolation always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot through a series of fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely also he is adorable and gives expert massages definitely oh did you put a smiley face next to the a-f-a that works the greyspine manor with our cask of fancy ale/winei feel really sleepy and also very awake at the same time so what do you think you're turning yourself into a dwarf what kind of dwarf what do you look like are you a girl dwarf trolls hi i wave at thompson oh where's thompson oh really yeah we saw the statue but we wanted to get a better look at it we brought this gift for the greyspines and we wanted to present it to them it's really nice a thimble of it because if any of it goes missing-- is it sealed can we tell if it's sealed if we open it it'll ruin the barrel right maybe we can save you a bottle of it when we open it inside we'll give it to you later should i roll that one that failed me earlier or my little dice (high-pitched) my little tiny dice teeny tiny dice okay that's better i rolled a 23 we've got some bottles don't worry yeah keep nodding here's the thing i don't know if i can save four bottles worth but i'll save as much as i can sam and hey i've got it covered actually nostoc oh of course he is of course not of course of course not but for the mining contracts however wouldn't we need to speak to nostoc is there any way-- i hear it's very hard to get down into the mines it's very well-guarded right that's why we came to speak to him here lovely thank you so much (whispers) maybe we should talk to nostoc first we're trying to get to the mines essentially magrim you've been wonderful thank you so much we plan on keeping some of this ale and bringing it back to the household would you like some when we open the cask lovely we'll be sure to save you a small bottle you can do that i believe it is all of our business 20 minutes that's okay let's all step away from the house does he have an earring on does he have one of our earrings who all has an earring tiberius tell him to look for paperwork of something for the mines not everyone you only made like five or something you totally should travis and we point at the ale and give him a thumbs up let's walk towards the guards can i use my perception to see which one of them looks maybe the most interested or weakest insight which one of them looks most interested in our party oh good i thought that was a one but it's not it was a 13 which one looks like the newest we brought this gift hello we address all of them maybe right now yes i look over at the shaved-head one and i hold his gaze for a little bit pardon me not yet oh yes well-- we are here to speak with nostoc we brought a gift for him that's quite remarkable actually it exists yes matt signed by himself i see on the burned emblazoned wood i'll go talk to him he heads inside of the building the doors close behind him the other guards encroach keeping a very keen eye each one having a bead on the rest of your group about two minutes pass before he comes back opens the door and the dwarf goes nostoc will see you briefly but you best bring the gift i think that's what's holding his interest oh of course grog if you would is it as amazing as we've heard -- in the last few weeks a halfling yes you know what we'll go after her we'll bring her out we'll get her out of your mines good how much would this task be worth to you obviously we are doing you quite a favor and we brought you quite a gift no but i know she is probably wreaking havoc on your mines is that our business yes do we have permission to enter within the next few days obviously we might need to be prepared can i talk to good old nostoc while he's doing that damn it i am going to fall down in front of nostoc i am going to fall down in front of nostoc ow oh my ankle it hurts so very much i lean down to one of the guards and say what is that bell for flushing what does that mean like what oh like what we should attack them i string my bow i take a shot i shoot it 15 wait i didn't roll yet 18 18 what he is still well i thought i brought him i should have mentioned that i'm sorry i should have emphasized that more oh god they're easy goblins are easy orcs are not ogres oh okay ugh all of them oh well all right i'm going to cast hunter's mark on the most damaged one all right then i'm going to shoot lightning arrow yes i do all right cool i'm going to shoot lightning arrow at them okay 21 all right then i do something else 1d8 right holy moly so that's this 13 for the arrow and then 4d8 for the spell (counting) 17 yes then the other one takes 2d8 if he fails his saving throw yes oh he fails it so good two ten i can reassign my hunter's mark to him now yes oh my hunter's mark i didn't do my hunter's mark damage but it doesn't matter he's dead all right cool 22 yes oh no double move he saved against it
