it's so hard why are you guys so fast oh shit they are hey look world of warcraft pins oh look it tells you how to do it transform your crate i don't know oh my god into a mallet and i think if you wear glasses this shirt is 3d no i'm making that up but it would be really cool ah legit there's more you missed it yep minus one ashly burch no don't say that you haven't oh i rolled two 20s in my pre-rolls i don't know i like it thank you i appreciate that dm hi my name is devan bluebutton i spit as i said it i'm a halfling and i'm a sorcerer sounds like a lot of thought went into that oh we got music i'm so nervous what's going on out there oh okay have you heard anything from shenn oh you're so kind i think if you brought me anything they might catch on though i worry about you too i think the sooner that we can get to the house the sooner we can end all this i would love to ow it hurt when you hit me a second ago (scared sound) okay thank you now she is a shrew i'm not going to run anywhere already it's not trapped siggle (gasp) i wonder if it works the way it does upstairs i pull out my dagger and i cut my hand with it and i stick it on there anything thanks thanks i am useful also i cast dancing lights and throw my torch on the ground see guys why do you need another torch huh okay but i've got lots of light though oh i send one of the dancing lights in with her i send another dancing light in you're welcome and the thing goes (spinning) so it's a door oh oh well yeah well so you know gambling huh how fun is that but sometimes it gets you into trouble and sometimes you can't pay off all your bills and sometimes your grandma has a lot of gold and some treasure and i said it and the clasp heard me and now i'm stuck with you guys but i'm totally on board and i'm real excited to help you out and be free of you at the same time sure 17 i'll be behind dren then yeah and three dancing balls of light can i ask a question cantrips how many do i get i just can do them this is amazing make it hail baby all right that's gold coins go down the hallway it's 120 foot range come back as we're walking can i make the four lights combine together in the shape of a human all the way down at the end of the hallway yeah it makes a humanoid form yeah it says you can into a vaguely humanoid form yeah okay down at the end of the hallway four is it behind us too or just in front of us we could back up we could just back up then that's not smart i'm the only one that can get you to the actual thing that you need while she's looking at it i'm going to send a message to-- --to dren no one else can hear i'm going to say hey i'm thinking they might be catching on to something so maybe it would be smart if we pretended that we didn't like each other a little bit more than we have been i know i like you so much yeah maybe a little mean so they're not catching on as much oh no that was maybe a bit too much-- yeah yes i do nothing that'll work on these things holes on this trap i can try casting ray of frost on the tile and freeze it in place i mean it might work i can try it but tarvis in doing so i might actually hurt your foot but i don't want you to blame me because i'm just doing it because i'm trying to freeze the thing that's really smart what do you want to pick me up because i'm short she's also pretty short thank you as we go i hit a ray of frost okay shit am i on his shoulders at this point already fuck 19 it might be smart you guys to keep looking for little tiles because my grandma's really paranoid better than five oh obby that only works with people that are related to her well then keep trying i loosen up the cut that i already dug in ow shit it might not work hey see here to help no it doesn't i don't think i've ever been down in this room before but we've got to be close to the basement well that's where she keeps a lot of her treasure yeah do i roll against it i rolled a six ew so foul yeah believe me if anything starts happening here you should hide because her magic is really powerful terrible so you know this thing-- have you heard of gambling yeah it's really fun right so i took some of her money to do that that's all i don't know she has a big room of gold i just took some of it i really don't know that's what i mean but she might keep the emerald down there yeah it's in the basement uh-huh ooh can i go over and look at them oh no we're halfling this is the one that got me killed so i don't know if you want to roll that yeah no no it didn't natural 20 ooh are we doing this i want to investigate them too seven we suck that's pretty cool i start heading towards the exit of the room sure just make sure i can still use my hands why are we going-- sure this is a storage room the rest of her stuff is in the house yeah this is not the basement this is a storage room yes right i came in from the other way where's the other way well yeah this is the basement gold i think so do you want me to grab some gold to show you it's fine we're not here for the gold but sure and i pick up some gold i knew there were more than before oh no can't i dodge out of the way can't i dodge out of the way ah shit oh no oh no oh my gosh i don't even want to roll that one again that was so close oh god that's a lot 20 with my hand stuck in it i set my hands on fire and cast burning hands that's a good question just roll oh come on oh wait can i reroll ones on the damage no i don't want to use a sorcery point yet four on 3d6 two ones and a two like the worst does it let go of me oh wait ugh i don't know ugh no i'm good they're on to us oh no could i have tried to wiggle free could i have tried to break the grapple with my turn is that possible should i have tried to break the grapple ah my hand she doesn't care she wouldn't care if she did oh by the way it's on fire now it ignites anything on fire you could dance around the back of him yeah totally you roll roll a 20 oh that's good plus six so 20 is the attack so d6 plus four ooh eight and then two more d6 13 demogorgon i'll feel real bad if i just fucked everybody up ooh scimitar can i pull my hand out i'm so weak though natural 20 (cheering) that is my action (sad trombone) okay yeah i will try to move away from it i don't want to waste the spell i don't know i'm going to misty step next to tarvis oh it's an acid creature plus five is 20 nah it doesn't work on the damage rolls but that's okay plus three so four and then 2d6 so 14 are you okay tarvis okay i'm going to hop up over the chest right there well i'm going to ray of frost the big one yeah i'm going to get a little closer yeah on a hit so i make a ranged spell attack but i don't know what my-- ten yeah i hop up on a chest behind me ooh a d12 it looks like a ball it's the other one that looks like a ball we're rolling like shit it's not dead yet damn i'm going to hop down from the chests the other direction the ones that tarvis ran his swords over can i go see if any of those are mimics you said one of the locks got busted when he did it can i open it up electrum i want them do i have anything on me that i can dig in i take my cloak off and i dust it in there to see if it bites at it i don't know i'm going to keep looking at coins good job guys that was really scary i'm sorry about that tarvis i insight check him i know he's full of shit can i insight check him 17 insight so i know if he's full of shit were you lying or were you telling the truth yeah i'm okay wow sorry i did that they've never been monsters before it's just been actual chests of gold what chest which one all of them gold oh it's electrum yeah it's not as good as gold it's like a nickel to a quarter do you want to kill me and you'll never get the-- do you want to kill me but maybe she's keeping the jewel in one of the chests maybe the mimic has the thing inside of it is there a big emerald in there is that the stone you're looking for sure oh i don't think this is the one it really would be smart to look i'll search the room for the jewel yeah 11 i pocket as much as i can shit six damn it aw come on really nice awesome clothes damn it this was worth a lot of money can i look around the room for the rat symbol anywhere i was looking for the jewel before oh natural 20 damn it what a damn waste of a 20 this is the basement this is the basement upstairs you know the entryway and then-- well if it's not in here the only other place that i can think of that it would be-- (groans) is down the hallway it's upstairs up-up well yeah i mean it's the basement where else is it going to lead it leads to her office yeah does my grandma like dogs yeah like well i mean not that i know of why well my grandma is really paranoid sure i don't know why you want to check a desk i mean you're looking for an emerald right a big fat one me okay i would have to roll like nothing because-- ten while they're looking at that can i look at the big book in the room i don't know halfling i think the pillar probably supports the room what do you want me to do 18 are there any keys she's a sorcerer just like me only stronger look you guys want a jewel you have me here i don't why you're not listening to me it's going to be upstairs yeah but those weren't there before you know all right and i walk towards the-- the hall the room can i lead them there should we do you trust me travis sam and do you want a jewel travis and do you hear dogs no this is a hall though do you want me to send some lights down the hallway 19 the foyer (whispering) do you hear any dogs i don't know probably a guard it's been ten years there's a library on the right and then on the left is a little sitting area and then upstairs-- it's been a while so unless she rearranged upstairs-- no my mom she split my grandma took me in she was a horrible person though couple years i know she doesn't even pay attention to how much is down there it's ridiculous thank you is her bedroom upstairs okay so my bedroom used to-- and then there's this room i mean it could be in there i'm thinking it's probably in there because there was this cabinet that i never got to look in i feel like that's where it would be in the funroom then upstairs from that is my grandma's bedroom which i guess it could be in there as well oh because that's where she keeps all her magic stuff where are we going yeah delweth do you want me to cast some dazzling lights what here's the thing delweth i don't know why we're not friends i mean i didn't really do anything to hurt the clasp in fact i'm just helping you guys i mean that's pretty innocent really oh really right i think we will we'll be friends afterwards okay they go to the same place (groans) 13 yeah is that seven this is the magic room upstairs is my grandma's room she wouldn't have kept anything of mine i don't have anything in there she probably burned it all no no no i would say i was one step down from the cook no-- i mean she taught me some spells and i do dancing lights see just this is one i take it away she taught me some stuff i take them over to the room there's nothing in here *nsync thank you very much i send a message over to dren how are you doing i mean are you okay i know i feel like we don't even get to talk any more oh well it's kind of embarrassing (laughter) no need for violence she does not give a shit just a guest room and then the funroom oh that's pointless because i'm going to need my hands if you want to get through the funroom i'm going to need my hands ow that really hurt too late way late i remember i remember a shield there's a very specific thing we have to do when we go down this hallway well does somebody want to go over to the shield on the right lift it up no bring it back down pull it down shit i think i'm doing something wrong no it was the one on the right no there's a second step can i look around do i see a wall sconce there's no wall sconce in the corner shit she changed some stuff no you still need-- the wall sconce is hiding behind these books well i remember my grandma did some stuff and things happened and we had to do things in a very specific order but she also said-- i don't know these are so tight i don't even know how my hand came out of it i also remember her saying not to touch anything don't touch it i keep looking for a wall sconce obby when you touched the shield did you hear a click did you hear anything click let's look for the wall sconce you pull out a wall sconce yeah yeah do we see anything a wall sconce well yeah it was right there no there's more to do sheesh can i walk down the hallway can i look for traps as i'm walking down the hall eight (gasp) okay do i see a bowl a plate anywhere a bowl with water in it no don't touch anything i send a message to dren-- are there any wall sconces up top but we can avoid the gravity scrawl-- keeping an eye on the ground for any more of those things i think she might be into some creepy shit don't pick up anything don't touch anything seriously through all of this have we seen a wall sconce i rolled a three as well oh shit 19 oh no plus six can i do anything i'm going to die just all of them 19 as well ashly and can i do anything 24 seriously okay i'm going to cast chromatic orb well then i'm going to use one of my sorcerer points to do a subtle thing because i can do it without any verbal components okay i'm going to cast chromatic orb as a thunder attack can i try for a movement to wiggle my hands out because it's kind of loose oh shit balls what was the first one was it a ten 11 come on wait no i still get to do something i'm going to try and swim forward and start kicking against the glass technically did i have to waste a sorcerer point for that since i couldn't actually do the spell ten not yet wait can i try to get my hands free again at disadvantage come on five okay i kick at the crack can i at least kick at the crack sucks i can't-- it hasn't reached that spot yet oh wait okay wait oh this is stupid because i feel like i'm about to be free but i wouldn't know that that's metagaming can i see that there's a crack in it all right then i'm going to cast misty step and get out of the box it's a verbal so i would use a sorcery point i've never been in this room yeah and i told you guys to look for a wall sconce and then you marched me down the hallway gulp gulp gulp ow should i roll or does she roll that's great there's a door that opens if you do the right things and there's-- it's there the room jesus tarvis it's really a sigil it's not actually a siggle i really don't understand why you don't want me to have my hands what are you afraid i'm going to do i don't think it works if i'm not free i'm trying i can't get my hand on there right look i can't get my hand on there right i can't twist it around (whispering) i'm trying real hard can i have a haiku i feel inspired i didn't know you thought i was your friend that's great i'm trying i'm trying seriously while this is happening you guys i don't understand why you think i need to think i have my hands tied you guys are the sneaky ones i'm just here to help i'm just here to help mm-hmm i don't see anything i'm facing the wrong direction yep (laughs) i think she would like you a lot i don't know there's another rat over there i don't know while he's doing that can i message dren we're in the doorway right i want to message dren and say i think the jewel is in the cabinet on the other side of the room on the other side of the room just remember-- these guys are tough i think worst case scenario we should get it and go i don't even know loosen the ropes see if you can loosen my ropes while she's holding it jeez oh that was a good one so roll it again and take the lower they were the same yeah they were both 16 no no no no they were both 16 if it is her voice has changed dogs dogs shit no i cast minor illusion of my grandmother in front of me

an object a sound or an image of an object you're right okay all right all right then i'm going to cast chromatic orb wait yes yes i'm going to cast chromatic orb at the dog that's biting me and i'm going to do-- oh so i'm going to do it at the big dog attacking tarvis then and i'm going to do it as a thunder attack that probably doesn't hit though what's my spell oh okay so that's what i rolled

cast minor illusion and make the sound of more dogs barking on the other side of the doorway we came in at and i try to open the cabinet yeah i cast minor illusion and i cast another big emerald next to it i did too i don't know which one's the real one don't put your hands on anything i grab the emerald yeah the real one i try to pass it to dren here you hold this i'll try grabbing something else and then i try grabbing something else in the room okay i cast mirror image and i-- one that's my passive perception is 11 13 i cast mirror image that creates three other images of myself and i take off running i run straight forward yeah but all my mirror images are going to run different directions so he won't know which one is me oh god wait no if i roll a d20 i determine whether the attack hits me or another one of my duplicates (gasps) oh shit yeah wait i have to roll a d20 if i roll a six or higher then it attacks a duplicate the duplicate's ac equals ten plus my dexterity modifier so 11 so it would've hit it but that's if-- whoa if i roll a six or higher and i rolled a six so if an attack hits a duplicate the duplicate is destroyed oh jeez louise 20 20 as well oh no you aimed at me you hit me okay seven damage would i have any idea how to actually get out of this room do you have the ledger in your hands should i oh my gosh sam and it's my turn i don't have any idea how to get out of this room no i really can't oh god okay i'm going to use two more of my sorcery points and get another level one spell and i'm going to cast color spray at the three of them color spray is a dazzling array of flashing colored light creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from me is there any way to get all three in the cone yeah who can i get okay i'll get them so i'm going to roll 6d10
