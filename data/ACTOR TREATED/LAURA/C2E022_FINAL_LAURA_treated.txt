standing right next to yasha but i can't use my action to make her doing anything-- okay and then i'm going to use my bonus action-- yeah healing word at level two on beau i know that's lame but it's something oh that's good that's 11 points of healing that’s all i can do and my action and i'm not going to move invoke duplicity attack the one next to beau (coos) (laughter) it's okay stick with the ones that were good for you that one and the pink one technically because beau's on the ground how much damage do you do because you hit it stairs are any of them looking rough i'm going to have jester run up to the one that beau just hit-- yeah the me yeah and i'm going to inflict wounds on it at level one it's a touch though yeah no it doesn't matter they're slippery little suckers for my

yeah she's going to-- i'm going to step out of the water by the way for my movement that's a really big cat paw i'm going to run to the other side of beau yeah so i'm flanking it yeah i wouldn't be able to hit it from the land would i okay so i would get a straight attack right okay i'm going to try to hit it with a level three inflict wounds well a straight because it's flanked that's 11 no

invisible oh kiri i'm going to find you say warmer or colder and i start walking around the room warmer this is a weird-looking wall kiri good for you i did too just barely it was a bad day for me kiri did you go stab a dead person we should probably teach you that's not the coolest thing to do i don't think but it's fine that you did it this time i'm sure he didn't feel it but probably if we're in a place where other people are around we probably shouldn't stab people that are already hurt i mean no that's a lie unless they are attacking you don't stab people that are dead-dead okay okay okay okay watch me roll a fucking 20 on this oh god no that was cocked and i just moved it oh good that’s worse four were you holding those the whole time put those books in this pink bag okay all right i'll have her hold on to my belt as we swim oh yeah i put them in my coat don't worry they're fine yeah just kidding they're in the bag don't worry are you looking who's looking (exaggerated cockney accent) enchantment ooh what are all these things molly yeah i want to find something for the traveler 11 i'm looking for the traveler's symbol whoa look oh i wasn't talking to you look the traveler lookit you have symbols here it is a door he's a traveler he travels yeah well if he is he was fucking with me earlier are you in here i don't think so which ones are the bad ones doesn't matter good job nott it’s made of rubber maybe it's ceremonial no wait let caleb look at it what if it's super-duper cursed yasha you know there are a lot of shackles around everywhere right didn't we find like four manacles and there were four dead bodies too right in the other room why would you do that are you trying to bring about this really weird god can i reach in and try to get it out ooh i reach in and grab that what is this i still grab the other little symbol want to look at it looks like it's an eyeball i hold it up in front of my face can i see through it all right of course i will thank you very much i am i'm listening he's not talking right now he's muttering are we far enough away from it proficiency so 17 is it magic (gasps) can i use mending on it on the sword yeah okay like an eyeball i know i pass it over to nott here i'm not learning anything take advantage i walk back over to caleb it exists liam (singing) i want to feel the heat with somebody can i touch his chest and his stomach caleb did you identify it before it went into him what was it you have the thing in you yes yeah you stuck it into your chest who was he i've heard you say his name before well what if you're cursed now how do we know you're going to be okay you have a weird thing inside of you maybe he's alive and you were seeing through his eyes right now maybe there's more than one (gasps) i feel like something's going to attack us maybe mermaids rescued you maybe you're a mermaid and you don't know what was the explosion you talked about oh man that's totally weird that was the whole reason they attacked was-- what if they attack you now yeah we solved the mystery he's coughing up salt water again i don't think he's a mermaid anymore caleb can you detect magic on fjord can you sense anything no let’s get out of here should we gather up all of the things and put them back up in the tree okay we'll take it all back upstairs are any of the weapons that we found better than my handaxe you're beau you're looking for a staff i put it in the bag don't try to stick this inside of you too though okay won't the sound attract all of the things i feel like the sound will attract all of the merrow people oh man wait but-- oh okay i wanted to check out those bodies that were downstairs no the human skeletons that were down they had manacles on them though didn't they that means they were slaves or something blowing up a cave i guess yeah i'll help why are we doing this we already did should we put them in the water or something caleb here's where you respond to her it's so uncomfortable (applause) hey caleb do you know how to find our way out of this swamp yeah aren't we done here yeah but he almost killed us like super easy well i have a couple of level ones left blam
