oh my gosh all that crazy merch that we have we have those posters you guys those amazing david mack posters that look so pretty the signed versions are going to be in the store for one more week and the non-signed version is going to be in the store for two more weeks and that's it and then they're gone forever so tell your friends tell your buddies tell everyone you know that's right and we also have our scanlan concert tees and our slayer's cake aprons our hats are out of stock but everything else should be in there if you guys want to go check it out in the shop at geekandsundrycom hey you're welcome do you want to make a special announcement but they're so pretty wait do i put that on my saving throws too because i was doing it wrong this whole time yep time out time out time out yeah like super stat right it's all just night all the time oh we look like the gloom stalkers no those are the flying ones scary ghouly creatures i cast it when we landed here i don't think so so it's still going yeah i didn't hunter's mark either of the guys that i attacked yeah that thing the smoky thing if we stay in this tight no i see nothing wrong with this plan do you have that ability there's no trees on the top of the tower then it'll take us a minute to not be mist anymore and by then they'll realize we're there on the top of the tower sure why not i mean we're undead we look like we're undead blend in are we at full health i'm not either should we take a 30-minute rest and roll some hit points i don't know if there's actually time for that though to take we're going to fucking potentially fight delilah briarwood is it considered healing as we walk there though i just don't know if there's time if she's already started a ritual yeah all right oh who's in a robe we're all undead i'll take a robe yeah i want to keep an eye out just to see if anybody's noticing if it seems like people are paying attention to us in a way that they shouldn't be 17 coming right for us is there a road we can turn directions kill it nice very nice so cool does it seem like both of those factions are still-- are they clustered in the same groups keep up near the thing everybody get close to the censer hopefully they'll be affected by the censer the whole group so we can all be with the wispy smoke we're normal people in robes can i just waft some of the smoke towards them you got this pike these skeletons are almost as old as you scanlan i have an idea what if right when we get close to the tower all of these trailing skeletons that we have on us you just turn undead and then you control them all oh you can't control them i thought you could she can make them poop hey did you guys know that travis is the smartest guy at the table is there a building we can duck into 33 and a roof (grunting) why am i i can talk go in that building that way they can't dive bomb us at least the right weapons drawn in case there's something in there me maybe because we saw it 20 are there dark corners that anybody could be hiding in or another room we'll keep the censer near the door wait i was going to say what if we turned ourselves into something else and snuck out and they would think that we're still in this building anything that was tracking us she's sweeping as she's running towards the door is there another door in this building we should go out the other door as fast as possible but quietly we don't want them to know that we're getting out the other side they're going to know that we're not they know we're not zombies we've got to go out the door out the door what dead body actually yes throw a dead body in the room and use dust of tracelessness as we run out the door so they don't follow us me please should we look for another building we can duck into to lose their-- so they can't find us natural 20 did you add ten natural 20 is there another door in this building that we can exit out 19 fuck you found a new use maybe just give it to percy yeah yeah i don't have any way to make fire but i'll take it definitely in my shirt now it's gone did it fly away should we leave and go to another building i feel like it's not really gone should i cast pass without a trace on us again are we running out of time on it i'm going to cast it again just so we don't dust of tracelessness is just so they can't track us it's crazy how that didn't work though i mean because it was a really smart plan maybe we can go under it is it far away it's like 15 feet from us you said is it farther than that sure the depth of the wall good idea grog i'll definitely try it which are definitely used wait to teleport things oh my god if the ritual finishes they can teleport this whole fucking city shit we have to stop this i don't know yeah but i don't think it's safe to touch those things i don't remember i don't have any in my bag you did matt's like uh no that doorway is in no way safe yeah and all the flying creatures are going to see us immediately we either go under the wall how far from the wall to the tower is it does it seem can we see the tower through the doorway a mile to the tower so it's probably two miles wide this whole yeah that's what i'm thinking what if we go under the ground all the way to the tower from within a building can we be zombie cows don't you think the flying guys will notice that yeah can i-- shit well you already rolled can i have been keeping an eye on the sky and give her a go ahead when it looks like they're not going to see her just go just fucking go hey guys we didn't eat a heroes' feast yet either i'm not going to look at him it's like in school if you don't make eye contact maybe they won't call on you we all are dead she has to duck down yeah so do you have protection do you have something you could turn into yeah but he's in front of you ask him if he has any money and ask him if he can make a good dinner because i'm hungry good job scanlan yes benjamin is what i'm thinking i don't think we have time to stop pike can heal us but we can't rest there's no time for a rest no time for a heroes' feast i bought those fucking chalices i think that thing is like going to go i wonder if delilah's on the top of the tower can't you make all of us invisible by anything does it look like there's any windows on the tower or is just a big old rapunzel tower okay well hold on 19 ultimate challenge for vox machina yeah let's get in a building and hide the thing that's glowing is off of the ground of the tower inside inside oh hey we were sent here by delilah briarwood you may know her right the ritual that's happening on top of the tower how long until that thing's done blink once for 15 minutes blink twice for an hour or more yeah do you know blink once for yes blink twice for no no that was an hour at least what if we burn the fucking city down i mean if they're planning on transporting this whole fucking city and setting an army loose on our world why don't we just burn the whole fucking city down destroy their rations destroy their weapons you did your hand signal for arnold palmer arnold palmer no really do you know anything about the ritual do you know if it's going to be over soon please we know you're going to transport to another plane oh my god he was going to leave so but set fire to the house right burn the whole city down let's poison the water supply it's an hour it takes an hour right the pulse has gotten stronger since we've been here i don't know if that pulse means it's about to go or if the pulse means that it's five minutes in he was handing out weapons technical terms yeah i could use 20 points what oh that's a one not seven isn't it that's fine that's fine well while they fly up is it enough time for the people staying in the house to heal a bit how come we didn't ever see those before is that a new wood i want it oh god i think you're out of range so you don't get the plus ten anymore i already did it if we had had a feast we'd have advantage on this 24 did we feel that (whoosh) within the building what'd you see that's where i figured she'd be can i run out and look at the tower and see if the orb looks different fuck well we should fucking get up there then huh did you see delilah up there and the ringleader was still standing so easy even one with that fucking wall she had last time we're fucked we didn't do any research on that wall did we that spell did anybody do any research on that spell that we saw her do down in the ziggurat i like the idea of bringing it down it's a tough call twice in a row i have a siege arrow what if we weaken the outside and then hit with the earthquake well delilah's still up there so if she falls at least she takes some damage wisdom saving throws are major she could take control of us yeah but you can be taken control of with your brain grog i just don't feel like there's time honestly oh that would have been way easier oh it's probably magically protected that is very true maybe we can prepare the feast keep an eye out if we have to ditch out on the feast early then we do we got to go 35 to 40 people let's kill 'em all on the way up they're trying to come over into our territory i don't like it they're all assholes and a couple people with wings oh god the creepy music is starting we gotta go y'all it's delilah she's going to destroy us do we have any way to neutralize her magic are there a lot of gloom stalkers around wait a minute did the orb at the top turn the same way that the orbs in the ziggurat turn oh and then times two oh yeah if you have that spell going you can do other things in case things attack us get up as close as we can to support pike and keyleth yes this is stupid as fuck yes focus it on one side of the tower both on the same side we're going to get close enough so that they can do their 500 feet distance but keep a distance to the tower we're going to try to get in a building that's closer to the tower -- need that anymore maybe just drop it and we'll be cultists yeah and then the one the guy that we just killed in front of the -- yeah that's good yeah we'll just robe it up i think that was already there yeah does everybody have their arms that we've run into so far or are they missing an arm too an eye and an arm or just an eye okay i guess so so exciting oh don't ditto i think he bought it i think we played it really cool there guys i want to keep an eye out for buildings too 23 the aliens are coming and we're welcoming them we're getting ready to teleport we're in the north there's a lot of places that snow it could be draconia there's a lot of places that snow is it winter in wildemount right now fucking get into the building that we can and then start it eff that shit just do it to the end do it can we see who it is let's go this sounds like we're all going to die okay i take off the robes get ready slow motion walk towards the tower well no they know we're here surround the tower climb up each side i'll broom it you're a dipshit it's 35 feet up so you can hop on my broom i don't know if he's actually here yet i feel like whenever we come across a map i feel like we walked into his hand exactly where he wanted us me and keyleth-- do you want to land over here as soon as i land i bamf trinket out keep a distance don't be in a line with us they've been peed on bitchface briarwood oh no what's flying no i don't need it oh no what is that my teeth hurt i mean it's a normal amount of time i have no plan fully leeroy jenkins 18 ooh nice this first round is definitely a surprise attack on them right we knew we were going to say it i have a feeling i have to roll really high against fucking vecna oh yeah tary had luck not scanlan because he's going to cancel it oh god you have to roll so high in order to resist you skipped me and i rolled a 20 we slow-motion walked into our own death walls brought down what does being held mean t minus ten minutes until he turns into a goldfish that's plenty of time for us to die oh good of our destruction of our doom hope you're wearing underwear bitch because he just looked up your skirt (small voice) me no why would you do this how you do dis matt no natural 20 (cheering) oh i'm really glad we healed ow ow (whimpering) i'm good they could just attack us until we die do you have mass restoration i don't think she can fix it mass anti-hold thanks dragon armor god we've got to roll like a 27 in order to break it a 20 didn't break it so yeah a natural 20 yeah wait oh i thought that was ten on being held she rolled a 27 there's nowhere-- we're gonna die 21 72 it's such an anti-climactic fight because none of us can do anything on concentration what does that even mean hey scanlan mind fire you've got this oh yeah this is one of the ones we tried a long time ago stop making eye contact look down he's really good at evil monologuing 38 to trinket she's like ooh that was his legendary i like that you have an enlarged figure grog that's cool i like that you made an enlarged figure for grog oh my god this map is so pretty (laughter) whatever it is it's really cool magic can't put me to sleep i'm dead insta-full death hey don't compliment the map you guys matt really doesn't like it no body left bro we're gone i thought this campaign was going to last longer than this you're not disintegrated we don't know you've rolled shit on that dice every time tonight yeah he can't do anything trinket can't still attack if i'm not alive he rolled a seven yeah he might go into the pocket dimension and trinket takes how much necrotic damage it wouldn't have mattered wildemount or some shit okay do whatever you want pike are they dead you're mixing him with your suude i haven't seen vax yet i haven't seen what happened for percy to get there can you come back down to the ground what does it look like when you're looking out at all of us and we're so sad he'll be a god in our next damn campaign when we're all dead it's because i called him a dipshit when he was talking earlier he is a dipshit before he does his cantrip i'm going to go you can go ahead and live forever but you'll still be fucking ugly the whole damn time (laughter) to my armor class he doesn't hit destroyed me it's red all flashing red matthew don't do it is that a natural 20 and you're below 100 you're inspired inspired use it it wasn't power word kill it was finger of death just the one just the one power word kill no we can go to the pond other bits of concentration (laughing) i get to go oh yeah we did i know this is the first thing i've done i stand up i'm going to as a bonus action down my biggest healing potion which is one greater healing potion no it's in your armor 13 plus four is 17 healing points and i'm going to move closer to keyleth can i put myself in between percy and keyleth so i can reach my hand out we're all in a clump so we can still touch i don't need to move anywhere in order to be able to touch her okay i'm going to shoot at the death knight with my 21 with my blazing bowstring and i want to make it a bramble shot is anybody standing next to him sweet 23 plus eight is 31 right 33 plus 1d6 lightning damage 39 and then 3d6 sneak attack 11 additional so that's-- oh and the blazing bowstring six additional from that not surprising what about his concentration no i get to attack him again that one definitely hits this is way less damage 20 damage on the second one keyleth get us out of here where's vax no yeah but then we'll be able to recover a little bit and figure out what we're doing or heal us and you're holding your action keyleth what what did you just think of 26 is great you're nothing you're nobody what's he doing but her armor 6d6 fire damage all hostile that was terrible yeah we're just waiting on you to make the touch and you're saving your action until we're all touching oh i thought you were saving your action what is this game matthew don't do it i need taco bell right now in my life scanlan's back where's vax and we would have been gone if he can't move he's fucked vecna is out and ready to fucking destroy
