hero a giant one killing a dragon shh grog yeah well it did until it was destroyed by the dragon you're a good man kerr awww ahhhh patrick (applause) yeah in your bedroom that sounded like dolores umbridge eddie (laughs) there it is what stuff though this kind of stuff you just wait (sighs) we have a lot of stuff we need to do that's in vasselheim we were just there yeah not so much because we told them we would give them a hand you know the thieves' guild thing the group of assassins shouldn't we help with making sure the council is in place is everything solid here just to make sure how is jarett was he fine when we got back to whitestone okay he's like fuck you 19 n-n-n-n-nineteen okay no they kind of have their shit that they're doing we're solid well allura's here well the problem is uriel was killed when the dragons attacked nothing else was ever set in place after that thordak no feywild not for a bit allura before we leave will you take a look i hand her the box of ashes that senokir gave us do you sense any kind of aura coming off of this or do you think it is what he said just a box of his wife's ashes okay thank you oh kima hey those boots it's unfortunate that they look a little iffy with your armor though just kind of-- can we have them back please we might be sneaking around you know in life or death situations and you're going to be here with the council we did give you that those are for you man no cause you have the sprinter's boots on you got the sprinter's boots on she's giving you the elven boots they're stealth boots they make you silent kima seriously though you are great lies lies we're not (laughs) you got it shit yeah let's walk to our keep and bamf out there yeah pretty much yeah we had to make sure everything was alright here you got a-- remember a servant of sarenrae came down and helped us rebuild eventually we do have to hire some people again minimalistic now i wonder if we should offer this up to the city to the council to house some refugees that haven't found homes again after they've been destroyed right should i run back and tell allura that before we head out i'll head off on the broom and try to find allura should probably head out then i'm back right sweet check one off the list in vasselheim he didn't say not to he said it was his wife's ashes after all do you not trust it did we look though did we look-- and i mean i had allura look at the box she said it had a faint magical aura of protection no playing with those dice are you so fiiine if you want to do it just do it yeah should we scoot this forward a little bit what're you doing pike do you not trust it too simple for us he's not he's not allowed i don't remember him saying that seems odd right i mean it is his wife's ashes some people are truthful but i mean senokir did wanna make us his slaves-- pike could be saving our lives right now ooh i mean it does have a magical aura of protection so it might be-- (laughs) i put my hands up and walk a little bit away can you both just ask you know we just fought raishan i don't blame this you're not supposed to say all those things yeah that's good that's good that's good yeah we should stick to the outside of the city right because of the magical laws there-- solid melora but didn't he say that she was from this area zaafin was from this area okay i have a thought what if we do bury this where he's asked but we put it inside of something that deters magic travis and i don't know like a fine container or something it was just a thought isn't there things like that like a chest or something that dispels magic so that if he is trying to do something nefarious then we keep him from doing that good call i like it could you cast speak with the dead on ashes abundant terrace be an idiot wow is that couple pretty close do you feel powerful when you go-- yeah did you just hijack her twitter does it kind of remind us of sondur's tree okay can i keep an eye out for any kind of tombstones or anything in the area that looks like anybody else might have done similar things oh is it at advantage because we're in a forest perception you said that's a 20 can i check 'em out and see if it looks like-- what well i'm trying to take up less space 'cause we you know what was the first one 15 shut up all right i don't know it looks like it could be a marker a tombstone memorial something like that we could that's cocked that's cocked okay let's do it it's beautiful are they all holy or is this like-- okay Â this is beautiful no marisha no problems with that solid anything with orange flowers around i feel like senokir would like orange flowers oh yeah did you happen to know a woman named zaa zaafin-- (laughter) she was a big fan of this place probably probably we've never buried ashes before great that's wonderful (clicks her tongue) none taken bad bad very bad that's nice does the birth heart have healing properties right does it yeah we're so weird that got serious some deities might like each other more than other deities though --like besties whoa let's stop let's stop let's just-- -- bury these ashes is it all right if we dig a hole all right sure as i'm doing it i'm like melora you were clutch in the fight against raishan and we appreciate it greatly thank you for everything you've done for us your trees are beautiful are you talking to the dirt (laughs) i'm gonna cover it it's getting covered could we leave a marker of some sort so we know exactly where we left her i saw earlier circles of stones is that traditional can you think of anything senokir would've appreciated maybe a ring he's a jeweler it was his wife that's perfect oh thank you can we go in can we go up and look or is it like-- it's just beautiful i don't think i've ever seen-- we should've led with that (through her bottle) that's why you keep things hidden she's aided us greatly protecting the world-- champion of melora i see it now it was beautiful though while it lasted i think it'll grow back grog yeah do we need to stock up on supplies yeah do you need to check in on the temple (gasps) just a fist fight yeah armor they got gnome fights what're you doing with a rock doesn't seem like something you normally look for it's more grog's speed there we can go there the braving grounds by the obleiz obliette it does oh that's what it was oh man are you looking at your schedule wow should we wait out here for you all right oh shit fight (sings the dragon ball z theme song) how long have you waited-- how long have you-- oh shit oh man yeah but in the best way it's serious vax but in a good way he's like super super smart (laughs) oh my yay scanlan happy birthday and don't forget tomorrow at noon these dice go on sale yay crit role dice no there's more than
