i've never tried them but-- so i don't know finding out secrets about people doesn't feel good feeling like they've broken your trust in some way right and being trustworthy is very important right so just hold on ah i pull out the deck so this is-- do you know what this is do you remember this okay so grog i have to be honest with you when you asked me for this before i lied to you yeah well i sort of tricked you and thought it'd be funny if i gave you maybe the wrong thing to see if you'd notice but-- i'm still lying i didn't-- i was afraid-- i gave you a false deck you wanna pull it out well you're still not supposed to technically do you want me to pull it out should i-- should you-- do you just-- yeah maybe close your eyes and get the deck out (all laugh) all right i am taking it from your hand these ones are-- grog open your eyes it's not really a deck you see it's a bag with rocks in it no you gave that to scanlan here's your deck still don't use it still don't look at it it's still very dangerous but i want you to know that i trust you with it oh good then still don't how about that i know basically i just-- no i don't know no no no don't-- grog you're making me regret giving this back to you right now i just want to say i close it please don't make me regret this i'm sorry that i lied to you even though you didn't notice i want you to know you can still trust me and i can still trust you to not fuck with this sure grog you're a good person still don't look at the deck i'm glad you have our back don't do drugs what do you mean 'the rest of the drugs'
