(fake sobbing) there's shirts and there's hats and there's hoodies and there's tarot cards and-- no but seriously the shirt of matt of our evil dm who's about to kill us all you can get a shirt that has his face on it evilly smirking so it's perfect check it out there's a ton of stuff available it's great and we've got some really awesome stuff coming up for the holidays too so keep that in mind terrible he's shaking his leg so much don't move your leg i'm going to take out a vial of holy oil and i'm going to dip my needle arrows that tary gave me into the holy oil i'm going to pour the remainder on trinket's claws oh no there now we can okay so advantage on saving throws anybody attacking us gets disadvantage what 31 where's vecna everybody just came out and we're standing in a big clump right here i'm on the other side of percival trinket is going to stay right at the entrance yeah good boy he's just waiting to see what's going on oh my god make sure you get his good side did you do this matthew you made this didn't you you painted it really i already forgot it's like i just walked into target i've lost all brain function 25 ashley what did you roll you might go before whatever some of the shit that he doles out he's just going to consistently dole shit out of course he does he's a god everybody gets advantage yes and he gets disadvantage on things against us any spell from an evil creature that attacks me takes 4d6 radiant damage and is knocked prone yeah we all popped our blessings yes pelor 12 radiant damage woo he's bloodied he's definitely bloodied oh for saving throws sorry i rolled my-- and what is this saving throw for dexterity 29 plus three that's 32 32 wait if we roll a natural 20 that doesn't mean it's an automatic success we still have to add numbers to it so 34 can i do an uncanny dodge for any of that that's just for melee attacks you have resistance to fire too so you get advantage on that saving throw so if we can't fly-- you're splitting the party this is crazy matt this is so cool but terrible not anymore because she lost holy aura because he fucking did all the damage yep that fast was he knocked prone of course he is it's only up against a wall for vecna theoretically 20 yes i did 12 that's so crazy they're like floating things reckless we all rage yeah you do you it's true so it is up to you i don't know what that is it wasn't him that did it it was the other guy it was the death knight that did it to you last time i'm going to look over at percy and grab his hand for a second nothing at all hunter's mark yeah get ready vecna-- and i'm going to run over to where grog had been-ish-- cry over you not quite that far i'm staying against the wall yeah that's better not that it matters very much then i'm going to shoot him with my holy damage/needle arrow okay that is a 30 great can i make it a bramble shot 41 damage and he has to make a strength saving throw well yeah but-- oh wait oh never mind yes 41 damage okay i'm going to hit him again i'm going to hit him again with another needle arrow what was that before i hit it i don't what it was before i hit it with this dice liam and sorry actually i think that was probably it 25 no that's a 25 to hit okay that's good 25 hits 19 that's it i don't get any sneak attack nothing 19 points does he get any holy damage from those arrows oh all right 19 plus another one point of damage yes i forgot yes trinket is going to look around really confused and scooch a couple of squares closer to pike yeah great cool to hit i guess yeah great he takes 4d6 radiant damage again from hitting me nine points of radiant damage oh my god that means we get grog back can he do that how many legendary resistances does he get he has as many as he wants he resists everything we have to keep hitting him and try to break his concentration plus four oh i was going to hand him the same one get your skeleton ass away from me to hit doesn't hit me does your armor pike do anything against people that are attacking you with melee you're little and light hey scanlan two my face is so red scanlan you can do so much you would know what scanlan knows and he did know that your wand gives a plus one to spell attacks and shit does it not count as magical or is he resistant to bludgeoning yay that's five of them now hope you didn't kill our sister we're all hurting so your weapon is magical isn't it so you can do damage against him i feel like if you can break his concentration yeah hit again but that might make him break his concentration you got this percy you've got this you got this did he take a concentration (laughs) you're just repeating everything matt says (laughter) or turn into something that attacks i'm looking rough oh tight thank you who by the way we didn't do meteor damage for you're a dick trinket rolls-- what is it a dex save 19 he only got 70 points of health he couldn't do anything dang it he really wanted to help out he even rolled pretty good maybe not quite that high and scanlan two is yours wisdom and yourself pike do you have a bonus action you want to do oh great thanks pike ashley i think it might be in our text chain between you and me who's he talking to you no can you resist it do it this could be-- (gasp) oh feeblemind hex is back don't worry guys i'm freaking out oh god he's so high unless everything falls i'm going to take a picture just because oh no scanlan is it a one can you inspire yourself oh okay i'm going to kick off on my broom and i'm going to fly down to velora-- yeah but brother-- yeah but i'm before you and i saw her fall it's not like i want to do it yeah i'll get her is she awake fuck do i see any kind of landing around me anywhere where she can set down safely all right but i used all my movement i can't get to it and get her there i'm not going to toss her no she's unconscious okay i had to go get velora she fucking fell i'm not going to let my sister fall so that would have been a 13 was the lower number maybe he's just pretending like he's not upset about it it was his journal was that a dog oh well that that doesn't oh it's a 13 25 isn't high enough oh his thing is 26 that's right you're inspired am i within that area if i went down to save velora thank god you're not there with the legendary resistances do you get legendary resistance every round okay probably no it's a 7th-level spell do all of the things that we gave him fall down to the ground you should do it but you should do it when he comes back that's the thing how high do they go psh yes yes really using all those platforms of yours matt do you have a bonus fucking shoot him but there's not even anybody over there okay scanlan you've got this what the fuck get rid of that dice sam he's got a 9th-level spell could do something yeah oh no do you want to hand me that-- oh you already got tape you're prepared this is amazing matt fuck yeah guiding bolt at 6th-level does 9d6 radiant damage shamone does that double the dice 18d6 it's nine just double it i like that we're looking like we can see pickle pike for grog that's fine you're still 20 feet in the air bludgeoning and fire you took less than a hundred how many hit points did you have oh you don't restore all your hit points with polymorph we're starting up at grog's turn that's an action not a bonus why is he going to try and do what he did to grog i wonder if that's concentration too it probably is right okay i'm down there with velora can i tuck her away in a safe spot under my hat definitely and she's unconscious she's dead did everybody know that and i didn't know that fuck i tuck her little body away and hope that it's safe fucking shit balls can i fly back up yeah i'll hover away i'll fly straight up from where i was with her can i attack him i mean my bonus actions are-- okay tell you what he knows that i'm down there i'm sure he sees all but can i come up and hover in the air and bonus action hide behind that wall do i roll for stealth did you see how that dice did that it was like fuck you 24 so you've got one hit point now so it'll knock you down great you're going to fly straight at his face oh my lord makes sense he's a god of course he does that would be a feat i would take if i ascended to godhood he's immune to fear how do we get grog up there okay sorry i'm sorry freaking out do you have to take it if you use luck okay circle of death but mass cure you can choose a point mass cure wounds you can choose any 30-foot sphere within 60 feet of you yeah because you don't see me because i'm hidden on the other side fuck i'm hidden on the other side of the wall so would i have been sitting there on my broom like as the wall has shifted away from me zahra hi there's shit going on she wouldn't even have noticed me hi oh thank you it's very hot but i'm going to put it on for a second because she complimented it oh that's true he does have a chain weapon can you do anything that's good okay this hat is so hot you're pretty close to being that what are you doing such a dick move wait pike i don't need that much i only need like 20 i need 20 hit points so good you have enough for everybody to get back to max so that's the thing everybody's back at max plus the two for the feast so move get out of range of him if you can that'd be killer i don't know if we can everybody's fully healed oh my god really oh poor j'mon no you guys got major damage though oh you can do that well no a 22 wisdom will get him plus seven or plus six to his-- so he's got to roll a 20 and then add ten to it so we've got to roll-- yeah we have to get them all in which is so easy what are you doing you can do finger of death this time they were held they fell okay i'm going to shoot some arrows at him am i hidden can he see me he probably can he can see all of course not but my brother is not with him anymore cool tight all right then i'm going to attack him with a needle arrow natural one i'm going to attack him with another well i just bundled up my sister yeah that just happened still cool i'm going to try to hit him again with another needle arrow okay that probably hits yeah that's a 28 it's a plus one because it's a needle arrow yeah i'm going to call out for tary how about that 11 is that it oh yeah 16 points of damage no i'm going to move i'm going to move around over to here and i'm still on my broom i'm going to use well i don't really have anything i can do with my bonus action oh no it's foreshadowing that's it damn it god power 34 halved again he knocked us right back down i mean that would have killed us right off straight up you've got one 70 they're going to try to take him out he's so little the skeletons are swinging above him you've got wings where are you at arkhan we're immune to fear and you have advantage on any wisdom saving throws just hanging out 28 plus 15 oh you have to take 4d6 radiant damage because you hit me with a meteor shower ten damage radiant damage liam and and then get three grits back if they die oh no scanlan don't you have a healing potion left 8d4 that's good that's good in the future you play d&d across states where do you want to move pike you want to be right below where you were basically what do i add to it i can't remember it was 30 plus 30 or something it was halves of everything and i add it to what my constitution no 17 you know what it's fine it should have been gone no it's 26 you have to succeed against are you immune or resistant to necrotic as a planetar where are we at whose turn is it trammel him yeah she's flying do it pike has ioun's you have mine right and then the raven queen's is the janky one he has pelor and he has the raven queen 70 i have plus four to saves if i have to roll a save we have advantage on saving throws constitution okay 23 i'm resistant to necrotic damage because of my blessing i fucking hate finger of death and i'm going to hunter's mark him and i'm going to hit him i'm going to try at least instead of hunter's mark i probably should have taken a superior healing i probably should have done that yeah can i counter can i un-hunter's mark him and take a superior healing i already said it it's fine if i already said it i said it okay fuck it i'm going to try to sharpshooter him because everybody's up there 31 plus three is 34 minus five to hit oh and i get sneak attack because there's a bunch of people on him okay 39 damage that's my first arrow and i'm going to try to do the same thing again he does take 4d6 thank you 13 points of radiant damage and i'm going to try to hit him again with sharpshooter 28 i moved that i'm going to roll it again because i didn't see what it was 29 minus five is 24 to hit that's cocked 18 was the second attack damage and i'm going to hop on my broom i'm already on my broom i'm going to fly so i can get closer i'll hover here i want to be closer to pike is it possible to get across to the other side could i get here am i within range of pike then 60 feet i'm higher than i would be okay i'm going to be about that height but i want to be over the edge yeah who did arkhan come in after did we skip your turn the last time raging for 12 seconds really your hand would be open or into the bag of holding oh no it's moving again do it whatever you do add your d4 never mind oh no she might be able to pass it to grog too oh that's good yeah he might have to do pike's too it's just that vecna gets to go between us are you resistant to necrotic i know i just was hoping it would be half again bonus action i'm going to take a superior healing potion so that's 8d4 okay so i'm back up to 67 hit points fuck oh no stun there's nothing you can do to take the effect of stun away is there oh that's it not lesser fuck me okay all righty i'm going to fly up to scanlan and i'm going to cast cure wounds at 4th-level that's 4d8 plus my wisdom oh that's good 14 21 27 27 plus three 30 points healed thank you (singing) something has changed within me all right but it's so hot but i'll do it that's as far as i can move right i can't move any more can i get over the edge of the floating building so i'm not flying over the crevasse thank you (singing) just scanlan and-- (speaking) no sorry that was terrible whenever possible why so low you do jenga on who and you would have gotten to attack him yeah we don't get necrotic for the next turn but if we can break his concentration they come back right big damage yeah that's good no that's our grog anybody got a camera so we can put this in the scrapbook later you don't get that because it's strength he's marking off a resistance you just did that didn't you as in don't keep attacking him if we keep attacking him he's going to take too much damage what's your hit points at now scanlan i'm going to cast cure wounds on scanlan at 3rd-level 19 plus three is 22 hit points and i'm going to fly down next to percy don't do too much damage can you grapple him i have 3rd-levels left which you did give it a try keyleth because what difference does it make you have nothing to lose oh no just the one to break his concentration oh my god yeah right what's your health at i know i'm going to cast cure wounds at 3rd-level on percy six nine so 11 no 12 sorry for my bonus action i'm going to take a greater healing potion so that's 4d4 yes whoa that's good 11 plus four is 15 to me and then i'm going to run over to percy and i'm going to hold his hand but i'm going to keep looking up at what's going on up there oh my god i grab percy up on the broom so we can fly up grog and pike are i'm staring at vax it is so late but he would have still been a god technically oh my god i love you guys johnson what time is your call in the morning
