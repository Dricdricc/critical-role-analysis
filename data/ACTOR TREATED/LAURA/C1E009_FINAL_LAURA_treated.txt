creatures that have been coming up keyleth we did make a deal we'll keep the horn from leaving thanks tiberius like so many half-elves vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence vex'ahlia and her twin brother vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief while vex kept to the woods she preferred the isolation always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot and through a series of fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely also he
