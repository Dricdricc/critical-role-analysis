just that it's the coolest no it's actually weirdly personal to put it together and put it up it feels like you're baring your soul so i hope you guys enjoy my soul and also song three which is like everything right i may or may not have been thinking of the critters while i was picking that song just so you guys know that's beautiful there's a lot of presents you guys they had to open it so that we wouldn't be opening the boxes we got a little spoiled i got a little spoiled early though somebody sent a new trinket look at that you guys look at him he's so cute please i have just been hugging it non-stop they're really cool i got this wood these are the kickstarter boxes though these are what's being done now or are those for sale right now and these too these are deck boxes yeah done let's make this happen count dooku oh god he's a goliath that's a lot of people for a door every single one of those guys can attack you now run away no you have 115 hit points are you immune to any kind of damage then just go through the door can you set a blaze you have a lantern your ac oh no i know what does this mean oh okay yeah you do it's raining up there i know maybe you should just keep burning it oh no burn in the hatch and then get out can you bigby's-hand slam down onto the count you've used all your spell slots can you float maybe you can slide down bigby's hand otherwise you'll burn alive on a roof austin powers they're attacking the zombie giant that's good oh that's good yes i like that scanlan takes out an entire house and we're all probably going to die you're a legend trinket went with grog you can do it buddy can i ask you really fast i never leveled up trinket's hit points when i leveled up that's important at this moment 56 four oh god he just keeps adding them all the shitty guards were over at the other house 61 i know i'm like which ones oh should i roll for trinket too oh he goes when i go 17 you're cheating it's insane grog's beard is better than that the one with the shitty beard then you add a ten to all of them doesn't hit hits yeah yeah he doesn't care we're all going to die 16 me and trinket okay so i run in after percy and my brother and trinket-- oh i can oh i do want to give trinket a round of combat so yes and he gets a couple of attacks if i don't attack at all right so that's good (screams) okay trinket gets two attacks because of bestial fury because he hears my voice so he's going to run around and he's going to try to knock over-- he's going to cannonball into the vampire guy yeah okay okay what do i add to that okay 15 trinket then comes out of cannonball and tries to bite the back of the vampire's neck or i do my two attacks okay thank you he's trying to bite his neck like a vampire oh shit ooh that's good 27 11 second floor's better than first floor anyway just act on the fly like scanlan did it turned out okay what are you doing it's a good ability if you're only fighting one person yay can i get up to the doorway tell me that i can but i don't get any action then damn it damn it janet all right trinket's just going to try to claw him yep that hits him that definitely hits him yeah 11 for the first and then-- just the dice doubles 13 for the second attack 24 damage he really just killed a vampire trinket claws crosswise and takes off his head with a bite damn it he's a vampire so the head disappears from his mouth or did he still get a big taste yeah you would we've learned about vampires we know they turn into mist sunbeam you know it now oh man doing the chaos he's a mist he pushes past the wind wall but it says that figures caught in a gaseous form can't pass through the wind wall in the spell i just read it so it's going to screw up my arrows so i was checking in but yeah it also says creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it it's okay eight yeah okay nothing can shoot through the wind wall arrows can't go through it it said which fucking sucks yeah it goes straight up to the roof it says does the wind wall go all the way up to the ceiling or does it go to a certain height okay i'm going to tell trinket to get out of the wind wall well he's going to move and he's going to be very happy to see me come around the corner of that door where i will see a bunch of dudes up high and i want to try to do conjure barrage up and over the wind wall and in an arc downward on everybody on the other side of it it's like a (whoo boom) i'm a really skilled archer i'm kind of like legolas can i get up there oh yeah fuck yeah i'll do it and try to get everybody in that cone sorry guys okay wait i've got to see how this works i just throw it in the air and it turns into a cone so i don't have to attack yeah they have a dexterity saving throw i'm casting this as a 3rd-level what about all those guys up at the top what about the other ones okay so i can't get a critical hit on this because i don't have to roll 16 am i right 16 okay yeah yeah and then as a bonus action i'm going to hunter's mark who looks the strongest not you yeah i want to hit him i don't know vampire drop your fucking wind wall so i can hit something can we loot the mist (ding ding ding) like scott pilgrim oh look coins (laughs) don't you get sneak attack damage oh no grog i put my foot on him to stop him that's nice of you you could just go (whoosh) and cross them off that is really kind of you grog run away i want them all to fall please does trinket get an attack of opportunity that definitely hits him though 27 11 that's better oh god well i'm going to-- should i shoot at the guys running away yeah are they close by i'm going to come down and get in range i'm going to lightning arrow because everything within ten feet is affected 27 no that's a lie 19 yeah and then get the rest of them so they have to make a dexterity saving throw that's a good question 15 okay i'm hitting him initially so he takes 2d8 they all take 2d8 17 19 plus hunter's mark on the first guy they all take 19 and then the extra guy takes an extra five i thought trinket swiped the hunter's marked guy though he did i remember you saying that i do okay oh gosh i'm going to shoot-- no i'm not going to shoot them in the back the guy on the ground he looks like he's in a lot of pain doesn't he i'm going to put him out of his misery oh really so i should get the guys okay i can't lightning arrow them again though so i'll just regular old attack and i can only get one of them all right all right that's a 19 again okay 13 and i act like i have another that i can attack him again i say stop natural 20 (cheering) and i say get inside now he's standing there now that's so freaking cool no we said we were waiting 30 seconds and then going in you know what you were amazing we killed them it was great i peek around my brother and go isn't there anyone else in the house if you're lying you'll pay got it i go upstairs with percy so percy and i are upstairs alone i go upstairs and i get percy up against a wall i turn around and slam him against a wall and i look him straight in the eye-- and i say are you all right look me in the eye percy all right i'm insight-checking him shit just shit ten i will i follow behind him closely
