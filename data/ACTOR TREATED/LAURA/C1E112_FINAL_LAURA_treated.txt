we got these (cheering) it's dalen yeah because you said it wrong speaking of talks machina though-- no that wasn't talks machina when i announced these shirts on talks machina my brain there's a new shirt for talks machina you should check it out in the store it's got stay turnt on it it's a thing for talks machina 8-bit foster have you seen it ashley also there's all the other stuff that i always say look at that pretty face he did such a good job with the dialogue we've been freaking out we're going to say hi what are we doing there yeah he is i'm going to take pictures yeah we need to keep going up oh somebody needs to heal scanlan no it was the same side i think it's more like when your toe was missing i think it's like that but what if you needed that we need to keep going forward either try to make it up this tunnel or we can try going down that path that the sphere was forming i don't know what that is travis it didn't go all the way it just started i looked a chunnel what's a chunnel so forward then huh where's everybody at health-wise are you solid pike how are you you got hit a couple times in that last fight all right that's up to us we could take 30 minutes or just keep moving should i do pass without a trace because they might have some inkling suspicion that we're on-- well i've got one level two spell left and all my level threes i can cast it at a higher level because most of my spells are pointless at this point i'm going to cast pass without a trace everybody's got plus ten to their stealth i'm bamfing him back out yeah but we've got pass without a trace yes are we in a dark tunnel they can't see us right should we put out your hands so that they can't see us well there's a bunch of people off in the distance yeah but you have to stay within 30 feet of me-- 30 if you want to keep pass without a trace 60 to stay within the ring let's stick around to the sides it's sitting on top of it that's the city the roots of the city crushing down-- so we could go up from here this is where we go up you can get that sphere again and tunnel up i know we go straight into the city we've only gone a little bit is it noisy how far away from it do we have to be in order to not hear the hum no put them on us i'm going to instantly throw a robe over top of scanlan you've got a robe on you now i put a robe on too yeah yeah we look like we're with them and i'm listening for voices do i hear anything oh 19 we're not within the distance of 80 so they wouldn't be able to hear the orb definitely we could collapse all the rest of the tunnels and we go straight up into the city yeah let's send it off towards one of those torches can we see any light from above us so the option is really to keep moving forward and find our way out there's three ways can we scry on the death knight or on delilah to see if they're with vecna right now because if they're separate from him then what if they're in these chambers he probably would be less aware if you scry on delilah-- we can scry through the ring right hold on i have to find it band of shrouds while attuned all creatures and their belongings within 60 feet of the bearer are immune to most divine magics that would locate or reveal the whereabouts of the creature most divining magics that doesn't mean we're immune to everything well maybe what else does she see you were scrying on the death knight not vecna there was that moment when you two were falling to your deaths before we entered the titan you were away from me so it's possible that he knows do we see any other tunnels that aren't guarded whoa that's a big fat no we can totally try that he did have a name what was the name you wrote it down yeah you wrote it down odell be like we're going to tunnel in this one now so move this is true we're going to be within 60 feet of you very stealthily no we're going to say we're going to tunnel in that area now so they have to clear out or else they'll be caved in not people don't let anyone know there's people but there's definitely something interesting we're going to hide as we get closer i can use hide in plain sight and camouflage all of us to where they can walk by us and they won't see us they're 120 feet from us okay we'll move forward a bit and then i can camouflage all of you because he's going to tunnel in that tunnel odell was the one holding the sphere right odell wasn't holding the sphere gray yeah it was gray hold on i pull it out and look at it yeah it was gray yeah does it have his name written in it anywhere so he keeps track of it oh this is pretty good 24 this is the gray robe it was gray the guy that was controlling the orb no the red guy was holding the orb the green guy put up the force wall and ran away the red robe i'm looking at the red robe i don't know we don't know okay so that's not the one we want we want the one in red that was controlling the orb no don't say that there's anybody that they need to watch out for don't set them on alert no tell them you found something interesting and odell is investigating it they need to go down into the tunnel to help him you definitely need help for it vecna's going to be thrilled everybody's going to get promotions so we sneak forward trinket's going back into his necklace it's too dangerous buddy so as soon as we get within a hundred feet of them i'm going to do hide in plain sight on everybody and camouflage everybody so that they-- on top of pass without a trace hide in plain sight just to disguise everyone so that they're super hidden i can use my ranger skills to cover people we're keeping within pass without a trace to see if i can actually do it i know eight oh a wisdom saving throw or a check so we have to stay within 30 feet of me scanlan stay within 60 feet of me yeah you can do the jenga what do we do if it's jenga can you cast something to help his charisma and his persuasion an hour it's plus ten i got 43 you shouldn't have given them the sphere yeah but we have to cave it in and they're going to see we're going to cave it in after them we did should we still cave it in though behind them we can definitely take the skeletons out though and sneak through potentially in that one tunnel we should still cave this shit in and it'll seem like a natural cave-in right probably but should we cave in this fucking tunnel so that they can't come back through don't go too far from me don't keep walking fucking away from me every time you move forward i have to move forward you can inspire yourself what if you're crazy i'm going to wait until it passes by me to whisper into my earring (whispering) maybe if we all go down the middle tunnel then we can collapse that tunnel behind us yeah we make a run for it and then collapse the tunnel because the other two tunnels are going to see us once we get in the middle we stealth around the other side can you collapse the one they went down then we'll collapse ours too because the thing is a sphere that can-- collapse tunnel one we still have to collapse the tunnel let's do it and go yes once they're all in there we block them in are you sure those seem like the most powerful ones so after that's up we all move as a group in that direction so we're within 60 feet of each other what do they look like from this distance so we should kill her wait is it an automatic crit because it's surprise sweet so 30 for attack 19 times two is 28 plus eight is 36 damage on my first arrow second attack no 38 19 times two is 38 plus eight 46 yep that was one so for my second arrow-- i'm going left so 31 to hit 19 on the left thanks yeah because we're going to tunnel this shit anyways right can i shoot the skeletons that are approaching 26 and 27 to hit we can see the sky and we're causing the collapse behind us we're up at thar amphala can we slow down at all or do we have to keep booking it to avoid the cave-in 18 so we can slow down i still got pass without a trace because i didn't cast hunter's mark is there any city on the way to vasselheim we have to get these shields down vax does it look like anyone has noticed the noise coming from this tunnel how is it even flying do any of them seem to have noticed this tunnel then come back down here so what's the plan here guys potentially i have locate object so that we can see it so we can locate it well we'll find out when we scry on it won't we i haven't i focus on the sword of kas i'm thinking of so many other things but i'm really trying to focus on this sword okay penises dicks no sword of kas sword it's buried does it seem like the dirt that surrounds the shadowfell is it that kind of dirt oh no now i'm thinking of dicks again hold on sword i'm focusing okay but i did get a good look at it at least okay all right thanks stone it was not being held by that knight no it was buried somewhere i'm going to give vax a super detailed description i don't know if it helps but i know we can both cast locate object yeah but i'm giving you a really detailed description we're twins look into my mind have you scryed on any of us without us knowing oh when you were missing and we didn't know if you were safe or not okay i'm going to cast locate object and envision the sword of kas to see if it's around us i cast it at 3rd level though because i used up all my 2nd so underground so we don't have to go above ground to find it do you guys want to spend time getting this sword it's super important to fighting vecna what about the earth elemental thing that you were going to do can you still do that and tunnel with that you can't take me with you if you glide through the earth can you it's that direction which is why keyleth is clutch it's within a thousand feet right yeah no i only sense things within a thousand feet what if i point keyleth in the direction can you glide as an earth elemental and find it that way oh it can't if only somebody hadn't sent it away which is by the way chasing behind us still maybe see if you can sense it right now see if you can take it back right now keep trying i'm going to have to keep casting it whatever but yeah i've got another idea but your idea led to this idea it's a building process what if keyleth took one of the gate stones glided down there as an earth elemental grabbed the sword and then bamfed back to us an earth elemental that's why keyleth could do it i can send her in a direction but i would help her find it how long does it last we have to have both i explain exactly what it looked like plus if i give you a direction you can tunnel in that direction you can earthglide in that direction until you find the sword grab a hold of it and try to bamf back let's try that i'll point you in a direction we tunnel towards the fucking sword we know the direction go in that direction in the direction that i'm pointing tunnel that way and then i can cast it again twice i have two more times to cast it no she can keep going that direction and then i'll cast it again in a little bit you can't sense anybody in the mansion then we go away we don't try to fight it avoid it yeah let's do it the sphere is coming out soon probably we need to get out let's peek up is anything near us right now no we don't we peek up first to see if anything's near us 27 is there anything around still pass without a trace i recast it it's okay i recast it 46 we have to hide it yeah can i help him find a place that would be hidden oh i'm so glad it's going to be so great put it in a cupboard all right it's that direction if we don't come back save vasselheim on your own and the entire world yeah another one you have plus ten intelligence 12 go underground i'm going to cast locate object one more time oh that that takes me out of stealth doesn't it and i point in the direction and have her keep following it is there an abandoned-looking building or anything i can duck into okay then i'm going to duck under something so i can cast the spell and then re-stealth before i come back out so i don't bamf in the middle yes i want to re-stealth and move until i'm directly over it 33 did she just yawn okay i'm going to tap my foot on the ground and point directly down to you keyleth oh does she still have the earring on any luck you don't know where it is can i give her an idea of how deep down it feels how far away it is would i be able to see the sword though if i was on another plane do i get your thing of plus two because i'm standing next to you 13 great and i would know when it's right on me because i can sense that much at least put that shit on me then i don't know is it like sauron is he going to be able to see me okay can i sink into the ground the ground is hard she's not 60 feet away i'll stay 60 feet within the surface of the earth so i would disappear i would fall can i cancel it once it starts getting on me and i'm like this does not seem right i might just be gone i can i'm on another plane of existence though i didn't think about the fact that it works in a different fucking plane no it's okay i've got the thing i'm just floating downwards can i float or am i stuck on the surface of the ground okay i'm going to go down towards where the sword is can i sense keyleth at all i can't see her right okay i keep going towards the sword i can't touch it but i know where it is can i come up into the cavern and you said there was rock outcropping that i can stand on can i get this shit off of me the oil off of me or am i stuck as an ethereal form it lasts-- no not necessarily i have the stone this could work you guys are in the mansion yeah we're good i don't know if there's anything wrong so you keep tunneling down and i'll wait come on it's been an hour oh the locate object right keyleth keyleth i'm right here keyleth keyleth over here i'm over here yes yeah (laughing) how long has it been i can't do shit i can't interact with anything i'm just fucking standing here 15 minutes this is the best i described where it was to you so i described that it was murky water muck is what i described to you it's surrounded by silt is what it felt like keyleth it's right here it's right here it might be poisonous water i'm not sure what it is can you hear me it's right here vecna can probably hear him i sit down on the ground indian-style it's acid i can hear you it is definitely acid i'm fucking sitting on the ground there's nothing else i can do can i see any of this happening okay shit trinket's still in my necklace i wonder if i bamf him out-- he wasn't covered in oil-- if he'd be in the regular plane or if he would be in the ethereal plane would he be an ethereal bear or would be bamf out in the regular plane i don't know how this shit works i'm going to bamf trinket out of the necklace i don't know how this fucking shit works i'm going to try to bamf trinket out of the necklace i was basically trying to let her know where i was can you chill right here because this is where i am can we wait it out this was the stupidest idea we've ever-- marisha and trinket get back in the necklace you're such a good bear okay that's it but here's the thing should you glide back to the mansion i stone back to the mansion with the sword okay give me the sword okay you can glide back to the mansion okay good luck and i'm going to think of the stone i already put trinket back in the necklace okay all right i pick up the stones and go in the mansion oh he would've-- this was really stupid we were so dumb this was so dumb i have the sword yeah there you go grog okay so here's the thing he knows we're here he knows that you two are here he doesn't know the rest of us are we can plane shift will you be able to get us back here though or to thar amphala oh god don't do it go to the pond that sword better be the most amazing sword yeah where the water elemental is are we fucked no i took all the gate stones yeah but it doesn't go through planes you can definitely hear the sword i like that you grab it by the blade so it's balanced oh no did we just lose grog grog what are you doing (shouting) wait kas is this kas are you kas kas this is counterproductive this is counterproductive we're all going after vecna this is so stupid you are ruining your chance of killing vecna by attacking us you're a fucking dick your sword is a dick tell him he's a dick i punch grog across face with my strength modifier 14 it's minus act like it hurt you fuck oh the sword is a dick that's funny good bad pike do you think it's worth it he's into slicing us up it went bad before are you always like that now grog you need to eat something you look really gaunt i'm really glad that we're here in the feywild and it's great what are we doing (singing) dare to keep a grog off kas no not anymore time gets a little wonky here is there a way to control it no he was great yeah he was funny and he also helped us and he also enjoyed us because we were weird you can get it later right okay maybe artagan can identify it you think he could do that i don't know if he's going to be able to control time though it's also possible that we'll return and years have gone by and vecna is already a god oh that's true maybe he'll want to help if he can (gasps) i'm going to cry that would be so wonderful (stuttering) it was a thing i'm so sorry that vecna found us the ethereal thing was a backfire how do we get a hold of-- to garmelie yeah draw a little naughty doodle pike is it boobies is it penis it's a novel to killing vecna let me see it okay what did you draw what did you draw pike he's a happy penis oh it's so great okay i shimmy it's been a little crazy actually we were hoping that maybe we could seek your aid please okay so you know how time is weird when we go back to the other plane of existence exactly it's so much fun we're in dire straits over there the world is about to be taken over by an asshole that wants to be a god and we're trying to kill him and we're here now and we're hoping that we can hang out here and rest and go back and only a few seconds have passed maybe a minute or two we definitely do want to show you a good time about it you can do that we have a bakery we found this ball of light crystal good point will you come back have we tested this it's keyleth that's sending us back and she can is is artagan or artagan you don't you've had access but you were blocked you're not going to become addicted to strangling people because you've tried it on him he's not allowed to talk i don't want to see it let him do it you'll come back right gross stop of course darling see you in a bit artagan this is weird as fuck all right i slowly walk away yeah i'm going to swim we're swimming naked while my brother is dying no big i'm so glad we can't see this oh my god oh is it safe to rest okay (whimpers) should we wait we need to wait 24 hours to bring him back it takes 24 hours it was that night all right well okay yeah this is crazy yeah let's set up camp here we know this area oh shit nice (sighs) yeah but we need to do a feast before we go back well the thing is it uses a spell so it has to be within the 24 hours okay but i want vax to have the feast as well so-- we don't know how long it takes we can try to wait and see how long it takes and then rest let's give it some time this feels weird to play you can sense them hey artagan does killing a wannabe god sound fun to you it would be much more fulfilling than strangling a person that didn't fight back right would you want to come through with us oh you have to have a specific doorway okay and that's a time-consuming sort of thing sylas is alive sylas is back yeah didn't you see him right before we left he was right in front of delilah we killed him wasn't it pike who killed sylas or was it you it was you oh that's right and you said eat a bag of dicks great so he's back what can we accomplish what can we do there's got to be something we can do what do you need to do what is it like a mount sort of situation you can turn an animal into a wyvern any animal bigger than trinket is it permanent oh never mind then trinket would you want to be turned into a wyvern hold on let me see if i've got speak with animals i don't think i have it it's 1st-level i can still do it trinket would you want to be turned into a wyvern forever (whispering) say no it's like a lizard that's really big that's got wings not so much okay just checking i just wanted to make sure it's your choice darling no he said no you haven't been saying shitty things to my bear have you trinket don't ever listen to him he's horrible like what like another artagan would they be fully capable to cast all your spells oh shit oh my god what kind of spell is this a real thing that could be killed right out from under him though and then grog would fall not with that sword well but so could one of us like what (laughter) completely oh death ward pike can cast that plus we all have our blessings-- not all of us we have some blessings from gods that will activate hopefully right before and another attack you can't hey pike do you know haste okay awesome it certainly made us opening a doorway so he can get into the real world a little bit more questionable we still did it we still got it ashley your drawing was amazing no don't do that please don't do that
