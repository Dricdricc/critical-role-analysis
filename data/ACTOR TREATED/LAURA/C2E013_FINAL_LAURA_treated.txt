good that she didn't get critted are you still up i did but not for that much it discards itself why me i didn't do anything to you 19 probably fucking hits yes hellish rebuke sam and i'm going to say i'm not your enemy you guy with big teeth but i say it in infernal because you know sure i don't know charisma is your spellcasting ability for this this is where it gets complicated i've got a plus one mod to charisma oh okay great which is 2d10 right that's a lot (coo) that's a lot oh eight so four how many slashing damage did you say you did to me eight got it nonlethal you get all your grit points back aren't you excited bitch i run over to beau and i cast cure wounds on her should i no i'll just cast that at regular i cast cure wounds on you seven points is he awake still or does he-- let's tie him up quick tie him up let's tie him up real good but also bows are really cool we should give him some because he's got all these barbs and they'd be really fun to decorate just tie him up quick is anybody writing all of this stuff down oh i am the inventory person shit you weren't even writing it down i didn't write down did you really write down that stuff can i take his helmet off and look at his face just kidding so that's one of the things we have as well is it a boy i'm going to pull his hair out of his face so he can see us what is the name of the romantic lead in the romance novel no no not my romance novel the one about these guys the marrow valley can i heal him and wake him up are you guys ready theo most people like me too though and i'm blue and he's blue i pat him on his little cheek and i say wake up theo wake up (whispers) hi you're not dead because we didn't even want to fight you but you attacked us we are not with the empire look at us where's my persuasion where's persuasion where oh nine marisha and oh theo what big teeth you have i pull it out that's gross i give a pastry to him it's good to eat can he understand us can you understand me that's great devil's tongue oh i do sorry i was sitting on it oh a resistance to charm you attacked us no we didn't you came at us with your sword out that's important people need to be born do you make babies still okay and they live as long as the beacon lives too there's more of them to the beacon what do you bind yourself to i thought he was going to answer i thought he was going to answer i think we should let him go i think he's handsome how long does charm spell work that's great i've got it too will the beacon hurt people though i'm going to insight check him 14 (gasps) was it the gentleman is he who helped you in ooh that's not bad i mean d&d beyond and then you can be our friends later he won't he likes us right you won't do it will you promise not to hurt us later but what if we give it back though oh man this is a really tough one what about the beacon i think we give him the beacon and we walk away maybe you can look at the beacon one more time and try to see what it is and then we can give it back to him can i look at the beacon (whispers) give it back to him you have it oh it is i go and look at it (hums) i hum back at it what does he do when we’re looking at it yeah it didn't do it the beacon wasn't the thing that did it what they're going to kill him though he doesn't like the other wizards it was stolen from him we should just let him have it leylas krynn did i say it right nice empress o' the drow or o' marrow valley oh right my facts are-- so that's where you're from xhorhas and the dwendalian empire is fighting you and they're stealing your babies because this is the only way you can have babies it all makes perfect sense to me i say we give him the thing and let him walk around naked because that's better then you can get out we're leaving the beacon on the ground beau i'm okay with this maybe you should stare at it some more i pull out-- oh wait you know what i think i don't have full armor for the crownsguard because i gave them away i gave them back we don't got no crownsguard armor he gets his armor back but you don't have the shoes okay and he's going to remember us and love us he's going to be our best friend he can do that when he's charmed that's what we’re doing jesus i go (hums) yeah we gave it back to him don't run out the same exit that we do okay i mean we just made so much money it's in the bag this is wars between empires do you really care you mean the leaky tap oh ulog go go go go oh he was going in the direction we were going no (gasps) i'm keeping an eye on the path to make sure nobody's coming down our direction oh you should have looked at it more but wait is there another exit or is it back to the-- oh shit (singing) back it up back it up back it up back it up we were scared things were falling from the sky oh i don't know why i took advantage no i don't want to do that god damn it nine plus-- 12 are they still with us or did they push us away let's go before they realize we were down there with the guy did he give that to us before he gave it to us already or it was an after sort of thing he was lying he's not giving us any of the money i bet it exploded when he did he exploded what-what i am too you asked for two people nobody else spoke up 14 is there a crowd around it can we run interference and try to trip the guard and get the thing back what if we go try to look at the body and then we accidentally fall on one of the guards and we make him drop it and then nott picks it up and runs away i run up and try to look at the body whoa what is that is that a dead body whoa i've never seen one of those can i trip and fall right in front of the guard that's carrying the thing i’m going to trip and fall right in front of him yeah but now they want it i want it back because it hums i'm tripping and falling in front of the guard carrying the thing as i'm trying to look at the body god damn it why deception i'm just falling yeah oh well i rolled a five oh man i want to trip him as they try to pull me away i'm going to try to hook my foot around the ankle of the guard carrying the thing and as i'm standing up try to trip him to the ground 21 oh my gosh i'm so sorry that hurt my tail so much i'm so sorry are you okay i'm sorry it just looked so inter-- i'm really impressed with how well you took down that guy though (pigeon cooing) cover it up walk away am i near him at all can i give him a blessing (whispers) this is a lockdown shit can we put it in the bag (mumbling) you want to put something else in the bag why yes a black hole and suck us all in we're going back to the leaky tap i think okay and we'll try to find a box to put it in maybe claudia has a lead box at her thing yeah but we need one what if they try to find it like tonight though or even at the blacksmith's shop oh that's smart yes we do i'm going to go upstairs to try to talk to claudia like we had like vox machina had oh where you speak into it not like where you hold onto it and you transport okay that's me upstairs talking to claudia and the spell will stop your average joseph from coming in here i'm not with you i'm upstairs trying to get a hold of claudia you would-- oh never mind i’m not there i’m not there that was a really good thought i had all the shit i go to the barkeep is claudia awake okay i go and knock on the door it’s me jester claudia when we were over at the gala we saw things that were going on it was crazy a tower exploded and then all hell broke loose did you know someone tried to steal my stuff do you have maybe a safe or something because i don’t feel safe carrying around my jewelry anymore with me claudia are you naked why won't you open this door is everything okay claudia blink once-- knock-- say you're not okay if you're not okay because you sound weird okay but you do have a safe i can put my jewelry in now well i was going to put it in my room for as long as we're here if that's okay with you okay are you having sex do you want me to come in are you okay you sound really weird i try the doorknob i get down on my hands and knees and try to look can i look under the door okay well the first one was really good perception nine claudia what are you doing is everything okay did you see the tower explode can you let me in 15 okay well we were at the gala because we were having some fun who are that that's actually a really good deception 21 (gasps) wait a minute but wouldn't that draw attention to the tavern okay who are you selling it to well see this is why i-- oh no ten oh friends are good can i have that safe though what's it made out of oh okay are those drugs thank you well all right will you be gone in the morning then oh no but claudia i really like you what's her name i look down at the paperwork on the table too is that what it says (giggles) okay lauren that's a good name i heard when we were coming back that they were putting the city on lockdown so if you're going to leave you should probably do it quickly all right good night thank you claudia for all of this i walk very slowly out of the room and keep looking over my shoulder as i'm doing it and smiling back at her okay i'm going to put this in my room thank you oh no are we in a room we should be in a room instead of in the-- yeah mm-hmm we did have a pillow fight (heavy thud) nott what is this made out of is it made of lead i really was trying to get a lead box it's true well we can still put stuff in it if we want to hey claudia was aware that we guys were in league with the knights of requital claudia says she's selling the tavern marisha taliesin and yeah like tonight to a girl named lauren spizzick or something so she said she was selling it and i said wouldn't that draw attention to the tavern though and she said no just her but if it does and she knows then maybe it could lead the guards to us though it might be smart but that might be-- wait horris came with us horris is in this room right now aw come on man you should go to the coast you should get out of the empire i don't know if she's leaving town she's just selling the tavern why are you not going to-- (gasps) where that's a lot of platinum okay so we also got-- let's look this sword it's pretty wicked-looking we also have these really super cool spiky boots i think you put them on your feet and they protect them i don't think they go with your pants it's weird to see the bottom of your pants because you normally have those thigh-highs on yes okay we also have these three daggers which look like-- are they ceremonial do they look-- i lick one then i lick the safe is it iron then oh and we don't have the armor anymore we gave it back to him you take your pants back off exactly will you send a message to caleb and say are we going to leave everyone else tonight and steal the big ball send a message to him saying that damn it i know and i saved you don't be a scorpion i trust you i saved you i let you have a ring that is so cute he will he really will i just want to go down there and hug him does he know that you think of him like his son no we can't out her like that oh now i feel like you really will because everyone was just mean what were you trying to find she's pretty drunk you're pretty drunk beau ten did you just fart that doesn't sound like an escape i hope they're not dead does our room look down onto the alleyway just tell us what they are just say it out loud just say it you're killing me (groans) i wonder if i have identify i could take (shushing) so we're doing it okay okay okay this way bye caleb you don't roll a d20 for hit points sam i'm grabbing my bag oh gosh we had no time whoa nice because that's your modifier aw three that's amazing i feel like that was really bad that was a really bad roll yes that's the rule get the rest of my morning on wasn't there a woman who was also (whispers) part of the knights of requital what happened to her but she saw you guys at one of the meetings if anyone is going to turn us in it would be her where's horris maybe he knows something about her horris do you know where kara is do you know where she lives do you know what she does the evening nip she works at the evening nip okay do the sewers lead out of the city the manticore head oh i bet it smells so bad oh god yeah we do know a smuggler ulysses ulysses stanneras he was in that yellow cloak remember we need a lead box should we go try to buy a lead box but how would we tell him why we need it don't you think somebody would be asking who recently bought something that would protect against scrying i know i wrote it down i'm trying to find where i wrote down bryce's connections i think i wrote it down in a different-- so it's got to be that the radiation area in fallout it's like get out get out now and i can't find it in these notes either shit yes --being a sister it was claudia no wonder i don't have it in my notes we figured it out the evening nip that's going to be me in a few months no we need a lead box that's probably more important or a blacksmith i feel like a blacksmith would be more-- yeah let's go to that yeah that was the first place we went you need to take luck as a feat again yes do you make anything out of lead could you perhaps make me a really pretty-- so my mother is a big fan of things made out of lead she said she likes the color of that metal she gets a lot of things in gold and stuff and so she says that lead looks very different from that and she thinks it's pretty so i want to make her a really pretty jewelry box out of lead okay it's like she has a lot of jewelry so something like around this big oh so not a whole lead box maybe like a box made out of wood and then pretty lead on the inside or maybe on the outside so she doesn't realize it's not made of lead he's a good friend of my mom's i think that is acceptable yes here will you also engrave it with love you so much okay okay if we give you more could you make it faster i noticed they’re blocking up the gates and i need to get it to her because her birthday’s coming up all right okay thank you that’s a couple days should we check with pumat sol and see if he has something like that he would be more aware of what we're asking for if we asked for it as opposed to the blacksmith okay just me what is it that attacked us you mean will they be able to find it through the fancy bag i hold it up to my ear is anybody trying to talk to me right now how do we-- oh okay can they hear me talking to it right now wait don’t pass it out out here before would it hear our voice or would it--  what if we say to it hey man we found this stone on the ground who do you belong to what do you think i know and then you call the mom okay all right it's in the bag how do you know how do you know he's not working for the empire the only store in the empire he's probably working for the empire i don’t want to trust him i had a dream about pumat sol attacking us i did i had a dream about it this is laura actually i did have a dream no it really was it was a dream that pumat sol betrayed us and he attacked us all anyway-- i’m just letting you know we don't know anything about him anyway i don't want to bring out all of this stuff from the assassin guy in front of him yes are you open all the time well my mom's birthday is coming up and she really likes boxes that have-- do you have a lead-lined box oh good can we get one of those probably the grande the middle still out of the reach there liam and what does it look like though what does it do oh that's pretty cool how much is your fancy box it's probably smart though huh it's probably made a bit better she really is she's always asking questions that are weird she can catch arrows out of midair that’s a lot of gold we should buy that box it was 15 gold we should probably get back and put the thing in this box though what should we have him make i'll buy a healing potion sicrulalium what mages were you with what mages found you were they with the academy that's right you were talking about them before okay shocking grasp did you just call him asshole should we go what guy no it sounds like smut to me you just wait let's go come on there are things that need to be taken care of caleb but we will be back because we like you so much thank you let's go come on we've got to get back to the tap yeah and to look at the stuff caleb identified for us yeah let's put it in the thing what like on me all the time i mean i can carry this box with me all the time but don't you think it's weird to carry around a box all the time i put it in the bag (laughter) how long does it take to take effect if we're all going to die eventually i put my bag back on what is it what are they what do they do is it-- could i use that a longsword did i put that down i might have written my proficiencies-- simple weapons could yasha use that oh that’s great i hope she's still in the city because otherwise she's going to have a really hard time trying to get back in i don't think anyone can use it what do the boots do is it kind of obvious well normally you're barefoot so it looks pretty good it makes your pants billow a little weird but i like it can you handle the truth ooh i take out the wand of smiles and i cast it at her charisma now you look so happy it's so wonderful oh right what are we supposed to do now but wait-- what does the general have to do with-- what does the gentleman have to do with this plan though oh that's what it was okay so we go to the evening nip to investigate her and then we just happen to talk to the gentleman too i wonder if it's all a distraction though for the big stuff well that was the high-richter's house but lord sutan probably went home and noticed his rug was missing and so did he go to the guards or did he go oh shit i was hiding something yes but we put evidence in his house so if he noticed that the rug was missing-- he goes to the crownsguard to report a robbery then they go in and they find the evidence that he was actually trying to be behind the attack that happened so it actually is good that we destroyed the rug because it led the guards into his house but he-- are you okay beau it can be should we go spy on his house and see if there are crownsguard in it do you think they would let anyone back into the tri-spire for what i am sad that i did that to her because-- shit hi yes i would like some milk do we follow him thank you all of us lucien that's a cool name everybody's a liar you sneaky bastard
