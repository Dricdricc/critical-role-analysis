just need to remember it 11 on the first-- oh wait i should probably roll to see if it hits i'm dumb natural 20 (cheering) 18 natural-- wait natural 16 on the second one so that hits again ten plus five 15 on the second hit third swipe-- then 13 plus six 19 that hits again that's eight these are my claws oh no i didn't do-- that last one was to see if it hits this last one is only eight points of damage crazy and eight it's 1d6 plus the rite of-- wait plus strength okay she'll get a swipe at me but-- yeah okay i'm going to back up no fuck it i'm going to stand there fuck it but all the dice plus ten you double that too oh that's right we're all flanking her but you have advantage because you're flanking so it's balanced you get to roll to see if you stay frightened at the top of a turn

correctly yes do we get-- i'm going to run over and-- i'm going to run over to the iron woe and hit her a couple times yes claw claw claw see if it hits that first one doesn't hit that second one does hit third-- oh wait i wanted to go around to the back of her so i could flank her can i flank her so those first two rolls do i just say the first one hit and then i'll roll again i rolled a 19 natural 19 on that next hit no this is the second attack no because i got advantage remember because i'm flanking natural 20 on the second one i don't think the last one hits eight plus whatever it is six 14 okay the first one is six plus five is 11 then the critical oh that's four eight plus five yeah i use the stalagmite and i swing around it and i-- (growls) oh yeah you can't move closer to her it's right next to-- yeah werewolves blood hunters curses it doesn't say it has to be 2d6 liam sam and that was the bonus-- she's looking rough oh my god those were two spells you have up that you can just attack with that's badass yeah because spiritual is not a concentration yeah moombeam (singing) guiding bolt her up the butt (singing) give us an advantage on the next attack (deadpan fanfare) sweet all right i'm going to run up to her do i get advantage on all three attacks or just the first attack from the guiding bolt i think it's just the first attack so i'm going to flank her that's not me i'm the reddish one right yes but the reddish paint okay i'm going to try to hit her 17 plus something that first one hits second one natural 20 hit natural 20 third is 11 plus six 16 no 17 still doesn't hit first one eight plus five is 13 and then the critical aw man eight plus five is 13 again yeah it's not considered a weapon attack is it it's just a claw attack zoinks oh no i'm almost dead no i'm still standing we're flanking her yo so you're at advantage i'll duck every time so 24 with one fucking bonus attack what is he doing you get another attack on him don't let him get away oh yeah you can totally do that she just picks a point on the ground and he has to make a save 120 feet (howls) that was my howl did you like it what is it natural 20 but you love me most man a druid that's a hard one to go on first time it is like the hardest class
