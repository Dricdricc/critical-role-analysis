practicing that shit in his bedroom i mean yeah that's good he helped us and then he fucked us yeah yeah he probably does you seem to like him a lot are you sure you want to kill him and not just try to get-- yeah i don't think he's going to understand the bag of colding the hand does really bad things you know what you should do is bring that to bahamut don't piss on it grog but then maybe if they try to use the hand to find it it might lead them to you instead because you've already pissed on it potentially you don't want people chopping off your junk thinking your junk is vecna's hand do you put it in the bag of colding all right tiamat's the bad guy kima yes what's going on there grog don't piss on the hand number one it's already in the bag of colding and i don't want everything else pissed on what should we do you guys we already all got tattoos didn't we no i thought we got them in character oh we got the slayer's take hey while he's out should we get this sword off him because it seems like he's a little weird from it nobody else feels that way nothing yeah no it's getting better should we get off of the titan maybe we'll have to get through the titan or we can fly down outside of that i don't know (gasps) sylas right but he's repairing somewhere do you have daylight still something with sun i guess sunlight would take him out because it's during the day you can't do it can i try to cast locate object on the pants he was wearing they're an object i've seen them yes nothing he's definitely recovering naked fuck nothing no pants we're going to have to worry about him at some point yeah but how are we going to take him out if you use all your spells to find him he's running away i don't think so travis and i mean if we can bring people back they might be able to so do we go see the leaders here that was a shitty spell he cast i'm going to hold on to velora and trinket i swear it's going to be the last time buddy i'm not going to keep making you go in this necklace much more ooh i love him so much she's all right how's kima he'd been taken liam and into the wood oh proof and that titan has stopped moving you remembered the word yeah glitter bomb oh

her in whitestone i mean here's the thing though i feel like i want to destroy it because i hate her so much but at the same time i feel like we should leave it because maybe we can talk to him

be the glue and don't do anything crazy anymore no deals with raven queens all right let's not fight any more gods i want to see if i can talk to him through it is that stupid we did a thing today a pretty big thing so much oh shit on everybody that was the best wookiee noise you've ever made babe you said allura took velora oh okay i thought you said allura took her away okay did i just leave her i feel weird just leaving her i'll run back and talk to her i'm going to make sure her wounds were tended because she was pretty busted up is there anyone who can send me to syngorn do you think we should-- maybe a message of sending can anyone do that pike do you have the message of sending to my father okay allura you've done it before could you send something to my father no velora would you want to go home right now i miss you too okay i think so too allura will you say that velora is safe and that i'll be paying a visit very soon to return her thank you apple juice for you little one i'm bringing my sister to a bar of course dear that's what you wrote down too can we have another cup did you see kaylie and gilmore apple juice to vax'ildan he was the best of us syngorn and whitestone i would assume in emon someone should stay there or you could just hang in whitestone the grand poobah has a lot of responsibilities too potentially why you've got enough juice to get us to whitestone right now should we drunkenly walk to the tree don't you want to see your daughter no nothing powerful comes without a price we saw that we just saw that with the raven queen power comes at a price you think that wonderful things are going to be pulled out of your hands here and there's going to be no consequences don't do it you've got to get your construction on (quietly) go see your daughter i'm going to tuck velora into bed i tiptoe out of the room and i find percy percival could i talk to you for a moment i completely understand if you want to stay with cassandra for the night would you mind not being very comfortable though i was thinking of camping in the woods trinket of course i send trinket to keyleth's room she might cry a lot on you all right dear it's going to be a lot harder to stay warm out in the woods now i wanted to remember how i used to camp with vax when we were kids i guess we go out and set up a little fire outside of the castle oh my god it is really happening i can't fucking believe-- that's the worst one you could get that is so bad well the campaign goes on for another-- i can't believe you just fucking did that ashley oh my god is ashley texting i can't fucking believe that shit you fucking idiot i cannot believe you did that yeah you're lucky we didn't shave your beard yeah you fucked up a lot hey hi oh my god that was craziness penniless two weeks ago (laughter) he is thank you pike it's absolutely perfect do you want it out in the woods i like it yeah it's stealthy perfect timing ash you were that young you motherfucker oh my god i can't believe you were that young i thought you were 300 years old jesus oh that's so great you wrote a letter you're iounish (laughs) are you going to be in your shop a lot holy shit that's good i love that idea no although we will have to stay here for nine months every once in a while because i think we should rebuild the families that we've lost five names five i definitely want to build a statue to trinket the wonder bear no trinket's around so centuries of people in whitestone will remember their mascot trinket as the years pass we should start a festival and bears will be everywhere perfect i was hoping to never stop attempting to contact vax through the temple of the raven queen i cast speak with animals on them and i constantly try to communicate with him would you be all right if we increased the pelor temple here thank you darling pretty much yeah definitely at least she had some good promise a long time ago we'll make you strong darling yeah there's a beautiful place called dalen's closet i think you would love it i have make whitestone the tits written in my notes of things that i want to do yeah penny bear i like it yeah wow thank you oh fuck
