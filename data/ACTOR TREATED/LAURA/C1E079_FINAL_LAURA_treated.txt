we love you yev it looks like your tiny little weenus is-- wait can i say yev about the stuff all the little pictures you see in the different videos he's giving some of those away tonight giving some away if you sign up for backblaze or if you have signed up for backblaze already you're entered into the competition and then you can win them and we've signed them and it's wonderful did i say it right okay cool that's a good question i have no idea what's in the store tonight i have no sheet in front of me and i have no idea what's there i think there's some hats left i know there are some hats-- no they did not no the dice did not get restocked the dice are coming back in like january so there's a lot more coming in january so that's good i have no idea what else is in the store though a hat there's a hat shit i got nothing you guys i'm focused on spells and i'm focused on arrows and hit points and-- (gasps) and the patches and our mugs there's still patches left you guys that's pretty cool yeah the hats are still there there's only a few left though there's only a few hats left i know that for sure sorry i'm stressed we're jaegering i take fire resistance but you know they only last for one minute each just wait for like a second just wait fire resistance lasts for a while i passed them out so if you've got them take them oh but he's got the armor-- wow just drinking a potion would make him notice us i cast pass without a trace on all of us it can't be vocal because it's pass without a trace-- oh no it's verbal no i don't do that i don't know what those things mean it's a whisper tell me it's a one tell me it's a one he may have heard us but now we've got plus ten stealth already take your potions who's rolling for pike i don't think she has anything so-- i'm freaking out shit i'm sorry i thought i was helping 13 good oh pike didn't even get a chance to-- we did we did have a heroes' feast we're all immune to fear and poison still we all have advantage on wisdom like wisdom or something no surprise there piece of shit is he bigger than huge so it doesn't have any effect on him is he bigger than 300 feet he doesn't even get damaged at all though i know how painful this is right now keyleth but it looked really cool just run still that's something that's better than zero no no not at all we're very happy with that is there water all over the ground though i feel like run marisha 'cause the thing that pike's going to do is-- yeah but just go i'm sorry i don't know how i just stole two pencils hit him gilmore what level spell was that gilmore no don't move you made it did you roll for pike what did you roll and then he's got disadvantage on something next doesn't he after you use cutting words matt and sweet 9d4 and then if we have fire resistance then it-- but what if we rolled 28 did we make our save 28 and trinket and pike both fail as well pike and trinket takes the full 90-- trinket is in my necklace again already so 23 24 23 or 24 oh that's right pike has-- i need to-- doesn't that mean he gets advantage on his attacks against you he's so big though oh my god what was the second attack cool i click my boots of haste with my full movement can i get behind the wall up where keyleth was headed i want to stop in a place where i can attack before i finish my move (slowly) go fuck yourself okay all right i'm going to cast hunter's mark then for my first attack i'm going to try a bramble shot yes 30 on the first i took the bracers off right yes i did okay 15 plus two lightning damage plus two sneak attack and a hunter's mark ooh 12 plus 4d8 for the bramble shot 15 no 13 17 oh 16 that would have been amazing oh that's right and an additional d6 because he's a dragon right 2d6 oh just plus two i thought it was a d6 sorry you're right i think no it's fine i'll look it up between my next attack i want to try one of my poisoned arrows 27 okay 14 plus four lightning damage plus hunter's mark is another four what is the poison do i do anything for the poison matt i am going to go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw for him which succeeds so yeah he just resists the poison effects of the arrows and that hits too that's 31 16 plus another four lightning damage plus hunter's mark plus two plus two because he is a dragon but i didn't do plus two on the second one because i-- and then i finish my round of movement and i keep running behind the building yeah right there i know we're fucked oh that's great that's good okay we're going to move to the corner of the building that she's standing in yes she's going to as a bonus action cast spiritual weapon at fifth level and then she's also going to cast beacon of hope so we should do beacon of hope and not do spiritual weapon because we want to do a higher spiritual weapon later so anybody within 30 feet gets advantage on wisdom which you already have but you get advantage on death saving throws as well --is any time you're healed you're automatically healed to the max possible amount and that's what you're healed for no this is a prep spell this is something that probably we should have done before thordak started attacking us should we have run around the corner if we had run around the corner would grog get well that's fine and that gets pike in that as well bonus action oh that's right healing word okay so she should do a healing word is healing word a level two grog needs it i feel like he's okay still so percy at a level two that's 2d4 everybody but she can't hide though no make sure he dies before he gets anything else moment of truth moment of truth i can't tell what she's going to do it should probably be like a black or a green or something that's like slimy no double the dice did you add your plus ten because it was reckless that's okay that was a six oh my god matt i'm impressed and terrified of you for having to keep track of this i honestly had no idea what my hands were going to do get rid of them he's probably got more than three he's thordak isn't that like if you forget to move or something you don't get to do it later if you forgot about it no no no no i was just joshing you that's good (whispers) okay that's good that's good 27 it's okay i'm happy that he's here that's right those robes are fabulous gilmore oh yeah oh no this is the laughter we heard about it drives you crazy i cover my ears we're all immune to fear yeah except for jarett oh good damn it can they fly do i get advantage because it's dragon-related 16 yes the skyship me okay where can i go to where i can hit him is the fire elemental right next to me asshole if i'm a third level rogue do i get disengage okay so for my bonus action i'll disengage and then i'll move so i can hit thordak so can i move towards-- back towards the very back building can i get all the way there okay so then i'm going to shoot him before i duck in around a corner or whatever and i want to-- oh that's 18 yeah it's pretty far okay this next one i'm going to use another poison arrow oh my god i miss him again dice jail okay okay third attack 25 yay one that's one lightning at 17 plus grog is standing next to him yeah it's good that's nine 13 plus 13 14 15 16 17 plus 13 oh no i hide behind that building he's crazy as fuck i guess so i mean i don't know what else i can do yeah oh sweet i whisper on the earring that was my brother that was my brother before all that he knocks you unconscious 22 he's got to roll under a four or lower to get-- it's possible it's possible these damn spells okay pike is going to run forward-- oh grog and she runs as far forward as she can we're trying to get a little diagonal she wants to be 60 feet away from him okay can she be at a diagonal so she's not lined up with keyleth and bigby okay then she casts heal on grog which gives him 70 hit points automatically healed and that's a 6th-level spell so she's going to cast spiritual weapon as a 5th-level spell as her bonus action oh that's how it works i thought it just had to be lower than-- should we just do it if she does it at a 2nd-level then-- yeah well yeah but she's always going to be at a higher level than 2nd-level spells so it doesn't matter okay okay okay wait-- okay she can also do mass healing word as a bonus action at-- never mind that's a 3rd-level spell so fuck it she can do healing word though at second level should we do that who needs healing she's going to do healing word on grog again hey scanlan (mimes playing a flute) so you can do something else i know his head is so high how are you hitting grog that's captain damon right to the rescue he's so fucking crazy does his head peek up above that he's so tall you don't know like why would he add wyverns for his own sake would the wings disperse the gas on the ground damn it oh no i am i am very excited 13d6 it was just covered and it's being absorbed so i'm not going to get itlaura  oh no sam sam plus 3d6 for your dragon no you didn't there's no plastic big enough to support him he's too fat to fly oh shit he's high oh my there's rocks it's on the rocks oh my god grog he's too big to fly we told you it's all coming down it's like he's going to knock over everything when comes down pike rolled a ten oh wait does she get-- wait no right when she needs it the most (shriek) if we hadn't had that heroes' feast pike would be unconscious pike is way low wha-- why but he's-- there's crystals in his belly okay i'm going to shoot him i'm going to reach back and i'm going to get a poison arrow no i've got six poison arrows that one missed sorry poison arrow no it's okay it's good that is a 27 15 plus four lightning does he have anybody near him does he see me am i sneak attacking plus four because that's two for being a dragon okay so you know and then the poison arrow thing my last attack i'm going to try using my last dragon-slaying arrow that i have it's got thordak's name on it there's two why do i have two ooh i rip it off and tuck it in my shirt pull 21 no goddamn it is the building on fire can i use my bonus to hide from him the building is on fire can i move and try to duck into the building i see a hole that's not on fire yeah i'll try to hide in the building because wyverns he's so dumb how about that that is a 14 oh right that's poison so she's immune he's going to use a legendary i can see it on his damn face you can't on your first attack can't you just attack twice with the dragon sword why not oh pike cheat sheet pike heroes' feast pike is going to cast heal on herself at seventh level so she's going to heal herself for 80 points so she's got 84 points now she was super low okay but then she can't heal people and then is anybody injured around her gilmore's still pretty low right okay then she's going to run she's going to cast healing word on gilmore at second level that she can do it at so that's oh right because now shit's gone ten and she's going to use her movement to run back into the building with scanlan i know right fucking a scanlan wait you're close to pike she uses war god's blessing to increase your attack by-- can she do that is it technically an attack that she could add was it really low so yeah so do i roll the ten or is it just a plus ten bonus oh my god 4d8 8d8laura  that's great travis travis thanks for getting my attention for that (laughter) that was the softest little roll natural 20 don't say that out loud why would you bring more things onto the battlefield do i have a view of it that's good that's good that's not a damn it that's a good yeah we're all dead on the ground and scanlan's like yay look how little she is is that one like still up or something is it like a concentration that just lasts oh contagion yeah he's definitely done it twice just do what you're going to do you could attack again can't you hold your other attack until he moves he's like welp i'm over this oh god gilmore is up his butt no oh no that's pike and scanlan isn't it what why would you do that to pike one of our jaeger controllers did worse than our other-- pike is-- wait minus 50 she's at 50 minus--she's at 34 points right now can you attack him now did i see where that dragon-slaying arrow sailed off to 12 points of damage 21 56 i can't see anything about where i am yeah i can't see that on the screen so i don't know can i use disengage to get away from the wyvern i'm going to do that and i'll run out somewhere where's the laser pointer i just have no clue where i am no way oh i thought you said the face if i'm hasted does that affect my broom so i just run out okay then i'm going to run through the building and under raishan and shoot up at thordak from through the building okay oh no that one doesn't hit okay second one okay that hits that's 29 can i do that with a poison arrow i should have said that before never mind 18 that's with four lightning i do get sneak attack right now 15 more yeah should i do the second dragon attack i'm so scared to use the dragon arrow i'm going to use my dragon arrow my last one oh good that was so close but it definitely hit oh god okay 17 with one lightning so three more and how many do i add for the dragon arrow i think it's 10d6 i think or 6d10 it's one of those two 10d20 12d12 he gets to save oh whoa that's okay i'll just roll this 'cause this is easier oh that was just 6d10 32 halved what look at the puny little fuck can i duck around the side so i'm in the building so i'm not in the opening yeah 17 so she's got ten points left and pike does and pike rolled a 32 her mace of disruption and then she gets divine strike right on her attack pike rolled-- fuck 18 19 it was 19 it's 45 for the first attack 21 for the second this is going to be bad if we have to take raishan out she's still alive she gets up (singing) she's going to guiding bolt up the butt at what level do we have left she's going to cast it at a five 4d6 plus 4d6 so 8d6 she has to roll the attack first or just straight-up 24 all right so 8d6 five seven eight ten 16 18 another two 26 oh good and then she's going to healing word again yeah she's pretty fucked so she'll healing word at second level that's her last 2nd-level and that's just to one person yeah so she'll so she's going to do that to jarett it's pike i'm being honest she would heal jarett so that's eight jarett you need to get up and fight yeah scanlan i can do that myself so that's 8d4 that is 8d4 do you do that or do i okay that's good we're going to have to fight raishan in a second she's at 36 hey he's got a hole in the middle of his chest yes she casts her last war god's blessing add a ten to that every time did you add four to your 26 when you healed her or did you just roll-- 30 for me eight for pike she's going to hit us no she decides where it hits no 'cause thordak's already gone who is that guy dragon just landed on him basically maybe you can jump and then cast it climb it climb it keyleth just do it it didn't drop fear when he died okay just checking (laughter) i didn't know if it was a reset when you wake up you've got big-level spells don't you still (gasps) he got another natural 20 that's a really pretty die that he's got too sparkly no why is this good vax be careful okay i run after him and dive after him because i saw that and at the edge of my movement i want to hop out on my broom and get ready to fly down the hole after can i cast-- 'cause i didn't do an attack right times two it's all times two 'cause that's all-- well 15 times two is 30 in the dark alone i do know can i fly forward before we take the break i just want to fly forward and hug my brother as he's just covered in dragon guts nobody's there vestige pike-- oh pike's turn jesus i'm sorry okay she stands up okay okay pike stands up she's going to run forward and say you can't have all the fun grog and she's going to guiding bolt level four at the fire giant okay okay okay that's 18 okay oh wait 17 she says so sorry i guess you do have all the fun how are you on hit points grog you okay okay then she's going to healing word herself at first level okay that's six points 15 15 when you were healing pike with the superior did you add-- oh okay so she's at 40 healed points now not 42 you know what if raishan gets hit she gets hit i want her to get hit hugs i'm heading ass-wherever stomp stomp stomp nice this is his level this is what jarett needs at a time he is bad-ass okay what are you doing i'm going to keep my hand ready to attack and hold my action until anything gets aggressive with raishan thordak is dead oh what do i see around me okay i'm going to use my movement to back away from raishan towards the chamber but i'm going to hold my attack until i think it's aggressive okay oh no what is this yeah but you can't throw your sword a 23 you can't do movement because you were holding your action like a chameleon she did attack our home should i have taken my shots when things got aggressive i mean did that look aggressive it might not have been the same fucking spell it could have been something like it yeah adjacent said come and claim me and flew toward me yeah i'm going to attack oh no this isn't about vengeance though you guys i don't know (sad noise) that one doesn't hit probably 18 that one probably hits 27 and a natural fucking one fenthras can sense my trepidation just 15 damage (laughs) jarett is just like-- this is at advantage because it's a dragon-related thing i don't know what am i rolling for okay 27 five bebes can i look back at thordak what does it look like-- i know raishan like (gasps) made him do that does it look like there's anything around him or is he just dead-dead still 29 i have to find out if i'm for sure dead i'm across the fucking room she's not done i do i have to film all day she might not have even needed to ask questions maybe it was just taking his soul into herself check out backblaze
