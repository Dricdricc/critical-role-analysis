that is six points of healing we're friends now you're welcome oh no ooh 21 yeah no all right hey i made a friend the little sapphire that's my pirate name do we recognize her who was that oh yeah coasters are not heavy enough do divers die there would i have heard ghost stories 19 i mean i read a poem about her her hungry eye doesn't she have a ring or something that you said in the song no i know it i just didn't-- i mean i read it like one time a long time ago yeah no why would you ever get a bad feeling about that her hungry eye oh dashilla well we didn't fight them under the water she's an underwater banshee for sure mm-hmm yeah it sounds a lot like glubby glubs (underwater glubbing) sure oh you totally could have gotten the stuff from that guy definitely wouldn't bye did any of us see that (laughter) 15 15 mm i don't understand what-- yeah well of course i do i always have a lot of stuff on me here you go i thought it was allison that's so pretty we've reached a new level i'm staring at this milk that i ordered and it's really disgusting and i-- no it has lumps in it yeah what i seem off oh i just well-- bless you i don't like her very much no oh but we're all kind of murderers sometimes aren't we no i mean we have killed some people no i don't i haven't ever done that i've done some pretty shady stuff though have you done some shady stuff have you done stuff that's pirate-y before you were a pirate what's the shadiest thing you ever did that's okay though but it is a really cool trick they got to see magic that's true it all balances out you've done really good things too do you want some of this lumpy milk no i know she's so nice and now we're pirates and i'm never going to see her again it's really possible caleb what if we can never go home nott definitely doesn't want to be in the sea i think caduceus doesn't like the water either basically because it tried to kill him a few times already i don't even know if he likes it a lot like avantika i don't know it feels funny well you know when you really like somebody but then you start to know them and you go do i like them or do i like what i thought they were and then you don't know and then you think that they are flirting with you but then you found out that probably weren't you know so you feel kind of sad about it and maybe a little stupid you had a girlfriend before though yeah (whispering) you said her name when we were dancing and then i put you to sleep and you said her name again was she pretty was she a boy oh okay i'm trying to get an image of her in my brain here did she have like a really good nose or something really you're mysterious caleb you know that and now she's saying we all have to take the same boat how are we going to get away from her just literally right there at the table are you okay tomorrow we find some books yeah that's important to him yeah thanks caleb (giggles) i thought about it it would have been pretty funny for you to wake up but i like you more than that are we sleeping on our boat where should i go i guess just sitting in here for a while all of us together i hit his hand high five well if we don't come back can't you take the mistake and go home two weeks if we're not back in two weeks-- mermaids are part pretty people and part fish people well yeah let's go can i have taken i'm assuming a short rest and heal up from my fight while we were all chilling here (whispering) whoa it smells like poop out here keep your hands on your coin purses tiffany that's the name tiffany's ship your heart the apricot is your heart tiffany can be invisible though you guys i'm going to keep an eye out to see if the mist ever parts around us don't you think it's weird that someone would be a pirate and they would come here because they were a pirate and then they change their mind and decide to be a shopkeeper here instead you shouldn't use her real name i like him i just remembered well i have this new spell that the traveler was telling me about it lets you pop in somewhere you can just pop in and then you can bring somebody with you it's like a doorway i would pop into her office that's a really good question let me think about it hey traveler how far away can i use this spell 500 whole feet he says i don't know how we would get out of it once i was in there though because i can only use it once but i suppose-- yeah but wouldn't somebody be keeping watch on the ship though and do what should we be using your name or should we call you something else right now too will we be using the fancy doorway well yes but that is-- that's the thing she would definitely see there was a new door i can't go twice i can just do it once tiffany honda keeps tiffany busy i should bring somebody with me okay me and you beau you don't want yourself connected with this at all plus here's the thing caduceus is really perceptive that's true that's true you could be sorris ipess that's right we never get into trouble together i mean this is foolproof any time we've tried to do anything together it went off seamlessly we could stay on the boat that would solve all of our problems i mean we've been staying on it already don't we have quarters on there we all wait until fjord starts boning and then we start our action this is way more complicated than i thought it was going to be avantika knows i mean tiffany knows that that owl is yours caleb it's not like it's a secret if she's seen the owl before she's going to know you're spying on her his boning makes thunder his weenie we head towards the ship we walk towards the ship shouldn't you be able to message nott and say she's on the move if-- so maybe stay close where you can see it if she leaves yeah we can just go to our quarters or something yeah what do you think because it's our ship is it within 500 feet of-- fuck yeah yeah let's go to our quarters in the bloated cup start it in the tavern could always use advantage we could potentially jump out the window too what are you talking about i'm so dextrous we're up in our rooms nott just look at the dodecahedron okay yeah she stole mail one time that and her beautiful hair (laughs) i wasn't beau i love your hair i wasn't laughing at you i wasn't laughing at you i love your hair okay (whispering) left second room on the left oh i see okay i don't need to be able to see it i know exactly the spot i desire i can visualize it because we've been in her office before i don't know i've never done it before never doorways are the tits i cast pass without a trace on both of us we are amazing we need to start looking because we only have a few minutes okay start looking can we both see because we both have darkvision we should probably figure out a way to light up the room are there curtains no we should close them i sneak over and close the windows quietly oh you already have advantage blessing of the trickster there you go i gave you blessing so you get advantage (gasps) natural 20 plus ten because pass without a trace 24 no wait 34 does she have a candle in the room that we could light take your cloak off and shove it under the door to block the light i take my cloak off and i put it next to the doorway to block the light i light the candle we start searching through her office we're looking for anything she's written about where the last fruit tree is the last temple i'm going through papers i'm looking through her desk seeing if i can find any false bottoms or anything like that to try to find secret information each make an investigation oh we get advantage no shit nine which is like a natural 20 in this campaign okay this is better than three oh no hit the deck we hold our breath i take out the paint and i paint a hole in the bottom of the floor in i try to pull it open 18 i was just looking but you can take okay sure (negative noises) is there a rug in the room then i pull the rug over the hole that i just made after we go under oh shit i do the same thing i see her do it and i grab my thing and blow out the candle and go two as i go down the hole i pull the rug over the hole i have no idea where this takes us (whispering) take one of the things you stole and put it next to them oh no that's okay 18 shit what if the poison is still up there i will lift nott up to peek her head through no what okay i bring-- i crouch down so nott can-- (whispering) what what's going on nott shit can i cast lesser restoration on nott nott snap out of it nott i don't know i didn't even look condition-- no one condition affecting and the condition can be blinded deafened paralyzed or poisoned okay that's good oh my god what do we do i heard them yelling how do we get off of here what should we do we left a hole in the floor nott tell her nothing crazy you know you don't want it to connect to us or anything i don't know maybe we can just get out oh right okay what are we going to disguise ourselves as are we still going to do that no it doesn't make any more sense though what if i make another hole in the floor and we keep going down until we can get out can i-- can i stand up on the bed and try to make the hole look like it wasn't perfectly painted like it was like broken wood can i do that though i wonder if i can use one of my pieces of paper to like put on there and then make it wood like fix it that's what i thought was going to happen but i wanted to see good show okay i'm going to do what i originally planned which is to make the hole not look like a perfect hole to make it look like the planks broke or something oh wait no should i do that leave the fucking hole the way it is we'll leave a couple gems in the bed two gems in the bed oh come on no perfect now we disguise ourselves yes we'll wrap our arms around each other and then disguise ourselves no oh okay i'm going to be molly in pirate clothes yeah with a cloak over his head i did it i already said it still pass without a trace still trying to sneak out 24 22 lies no shit run we run are we being stealthy were stealthing quickly we're stealthing still pass without a trace 21 the seaward side put that book in the bag so it doesn't get wet i don't know we jump in let's try to go in quietly this is going perfectly oh my god that was almost a one but it's not it's a 19 19 don't let go nott natural 20 but disguise self to where we look dry do you think i seem noticeable yeah but we're disguise self so we look dry yeah i feel like you may be less noticeable than a purple me okay yeah is anybody in the shit alley we should probably drop our forms yeah in the shit alley (gasps) oh my god no nott i have mending it's a cantrip and i can mend things that have holes in them not a hole that big it wouldn't have worked on a hole that big everything we did was perfect i mean it went according to plan shh hide that that's in my bag anyway oh we need to hide those too what the fuck are we going to do if she searches our shit she's going to know that we stole we got to figure this out like stat all right you did too you're pretty cool okay we're going to go into our rooms hi you're going down there don't go down there caduceus no there's guards everywhere schmidle of a one what do you mean they'll know oh should we look around the room and make sure nobody can spy on us look for peepholes in the room that keeps sound in we got a book nott found it yeah when we were looking for letters and words and stuff we ended up breaking her desk and we stole a bunch of jewels-- well and then the room filled with poison and then we put a hole in the floor and we fell then we jumped in the water and we got away the thing is though avantika's going to definitely know that somebody stole her stuff i like jamedi i thought he was nice well yeah but-- if we hold on and avantika's like let's everybody empty their pockets and we have them i think she's in love with avantika too because she pulled me aside and she was like i don't like fjord and i'll kill him if you want me to eight okay so maybe she didn't say that but i still don't think she likes fjord very much the jade necklace a given to what cracked the case fjord are you as crazy as she is because holy shit not your saving throw you have maxed out intelligence that's a necklace it doesn't say the name it'll come right out apricots fjord if-- i know we shouldn't have grabbed everything we could just throw them in the ocean yeah i like it caleb's brain we're part of the crew big lead safe not in the bag but the little box that we have the thing in yeah oh no it's getting late i'm getting confused too late i was sleeping in the room is there anything in the room that seems like it could be hollow or anything i'm looking for somewhere that i can put a hole in it hide the jewels in there and then mend it so that it won't look like anything ever touched it but i'll know where they are do i get advantage still if this was last night okay 13 yeah but if i get searched-- yeah yeah and you don't think she's going to go open this safe if she turns the bag over and empties it out everything comes out if you turn the bag inside out-- okay okay this was last night i was looking for a place to hide what what does the hallway look like that all the rooms are in okay okay i have to get dressed that's all that's the thing okay the whole bag i don't want to lose the whole haversack i do not want to lose the whole haversack nope it's got the dodecahedron in it nope taliesin no is there ever a moment it looks like nobody's looking at us or me no seven can i fall back and talk to bouldergut bouldergut what is going on right now me too everybody seems so angry at everybody else look at the ship right now it looks crazy all these people walking around me too while i'm talking to her and hopefully when i point at the ship-- does she look where i point 22 i reach in the bag and i pull out the jewels and i dump them off the side i want them to fall in the water as we're walking (singing) i wish i had looked at the dodecahedron this morning (normal voice) 15 bouldergut was in the back though oh my god yeah yeah and like a principal that always knows when you're lying marisha and
