add another log there yeah in that hearth thanks you are quite handsome oh hi my name is greldamine clypsol i'm a gnome mage i am short even for a gnome i know that's fine i wear my hair in a high bun it's brown i'm just the biggest fan of jaina proudmore i think she's just the most amazing mage i've ever seen you know i hear good things about her she's so powerful and beautiful sounds amazing i

great do you have robes i'm partial to purple this sounds fun wental you can count on us i jump on top of the table and raise my fist into the air candles great maybe to the shed since it's close thank you you have tentacles you have tentacles on your chin warm it up guys does anyone know that you make candles other than your father oh okay so you don't have any candle enemies and are your candles scented do most of them smell like animal fat were you going to track them is that with your grog dice yes we're clearly much more experienced fighters than you are how big is the recess oh that's small for a human so i wonder if these creatures who stole the candles are smaller than humans oh or that greldamine it's okay it's a hard name especially for elves (laughter) i could should i go in should we all go in gladly can we move these thorny bushes out of the way though wental are you coming with us of course yes don't worry hello yes but i also have light and i send light down the tunnel can i do that can i send light down the tunnel or does it light up around me oh what do we have on us oh well we should probably just use a torch then oh i'll pick up a rock and cast light on the rock that was a good idea whatever-your-toes i'll go first oh jeez this is so dumb that i'm in the front matt and with my 37 hit points okay shh can i hear anything ooh 23 what is that oh yeah you can stealth we can all try to stealth right now if you want to maybe you'll roll a 20 13 like five feet should we jump down ooh does it yeah no we're following we're following yeah (whispering) what does it look like no that's really cute how tall are they so they're taller than i am i put my rock out yeah what should we do how many of them are there taliesin and nine there's about nine of them okay do you think we could take nine of them has anybody tried talking to kobolds before an entire shed's worth i wonder if these are actual candles or if these are old candles and they stole his candles for new candles because the candles on their head are wearing down do you know what i mean i can be invisible sure sure i cast invisibility on myself okay i'm going to walk across the bridge now yeah i'll be quiet once i get towards the bridge i walk towards one of the rickety bridges ooh yeah 22 oh natural 20 ha oh no oh god and i start backing up towards my companions i run towards them and say they're on their way over here they're going to blow things up i think the big one has the bag of candles on his back yeah he said something about blowing things up i'm right here i punch him in the knee i could've punched something else we can do it what if we take out one of the bridges while they're on the bridge cut the rope and then some of them that are on the bridge will fall quick go cut the bridge cut the rope on the bridge probably 1d6 2d6 maybe 4d6 what level are we oh shit oh lohkor 13 lies 12 i'm naming you toes because that's all i can remember 18 okay it's greldamine are any of them in a line are they on the bridge still and then the big one okay and the big one is he lined up with a bridge or is he between the bridges okay okay for fear of damaging the perhaps bag of candles on the big one's back that would be bad i'm going to cast burning hands towards one of the bridges with two of the things on it the left (screams) my dc is 16 okay 3d6 fire damage and it sets things on fire nine damage i'm going to run away from the bridge and hide behind lohkor's legs oh i did great can i move at all i'll back up five feet shit i was oh i was oh yeah leave me alone next to it thank you thank you for the good advice chop his head off oh no this is bad 15 across the bridge right 19 oh i forgot to do this and i cast mage armor on myself why do we need to do that did he really can i use firebolt at it oh i mean sure if that sounds good to you i'm a rage monster i just like to kill things go for it you understand what he's saying because i can't tell at all does the king have all of our candles lots of candles we should talk to him what about now i like him can we keep him i pull out some beef jerky and hand it to him aw heal him please his poor hands if you want what oh well all right i don't think he's much of a pet he's more of a companion i will in a little bit what's your name reeksus you got it that's important should i light up a rock again they're quite tasty actually ooh yeah hey reeksus i give him a little bit of beef jerky okay do you want to go in front of us and lead the way to your king is it bad to touch it oh do you want me to set these on fire because i have some i mean is it safe to burn what if it sets off a poison when they're on fire i've heard that burning mushrooms could get you you know-- oh it's not fumes taliesin liam and oh i wouldn't know they don't allow that kind of stuff at mage school okay i'm going to go through wait am i going to burn it i'm going to get to the other side and then i'm going to try to burn it i don't want to burn reeks okay i go to the other side all right woo-hoo what is that 18 or 19 18 plus dexterity 21 should i try to burn them now what do you guys think it's ranged about eight i don't know what that means no fire bolt and then i'll hit it because i can do cantrips a lot right fuck-- i mean heck yeah i'm going to do-- they don't curse in mage school i'm sorry about that they smack your hands i'll tell you that much i'm going to cast fire bolt at the mushrooms that gives me 2d10 fire damage okay good i do the same thing on all of the mushrooms that are along the path yes but i went through remember i went through and i'm holding the rope on my side what hold on they're coming okay i go over to reek well what do they do i don't understand what he just told me you have that much gold that's a good topping you be nice to him it's good for digestion i hear ooh it's a gamble yeah he got the blue ooh at least it healed you while it poisoned you oh no no i use prestidigitation and create light flares around him if they're already tripping can we say whoa why are you holding that snake in your hand please oh no 11 we should back away slowly reeks if we leave them will you keep guiding the way what's it saying magic i do magic well i'm pretty blossomed already but okay fancy notebooks in the store yay should i read it out loud i have acquired aluneth this ancient extremely powerful staff was once owned by aegwynn egwin agewin the only female guardian of tirisfal this staff carries a mind far more ancient than most things in azeroth my spell attack rolls gain a +3 to hit whenever i deal damage i deal two additional hit points of force damage that's amazing they're pretty cool actually well some of them what what are you talking about oh no it's the staff it has a voice it said that i'm really amazing and that i'm going to do good things i think that it's like a really powerful weapon it's like the kind of thing you take with you for several levels at least that's probably what it is that's possible my mama and papa are very proud of me is it a he i don't know oh him not staff i'm confused yeah hey reeks which direction is your king hey look your hands are working again oh okay well we'll figure it out straight across they're laying a trap i'll bet you anything wait but you just said there's a big pile of metal in the middle and two creatures hiding what if they're waiting to explode the middle that's intimidating what about the two things laying in wait were they setting a trap they were undead just dead we should definitely check it out but there's a giant flame monster how are we going to beat him you think that would work i'm not very good at jumping but i can cast fly on myself reeks well hey that's a good point reeks why didn't you warn us about the giant monster in the middle there did you what happened to your voice that's deep maybe they just fell and they couldn't climb back up yeah over to the alcove i can try okay what did you say yeah how do you make him go back to sleep okay tell you what lohkor will you hold his leash please i'm going to fly i know exactly how to do it ten minutes sure yeah i'm going to fly and i'm going to try to go over to that little alcove and see what happens and i'm giving the creature a wide berth 17 i'm sorry you had a tragic ending i'm going to keep flying around them i don't want to touch my feet to the ground in case something comes out of the ground but i'm going to dig through all of their shit and see what i can find goodbye i hold it aloft i found a weapon i'll bring it back over to you guys i'm not going to keep it i'm going to give it away i wave it towards the creature as i fly by but i don't get close enough to really do anything which one of you would like this beautiful blade it's a staff oh mighty aluneth do you have anything to say about where we are it talks i swear yes how long since you walked its surface i mean i know i've heard about aluneth before it's very ancient long time you want me to go over to the collapse oh okay i'm going to fly over to the collapsed area because i've still got a little time left right and i land now what do you want me to do wait i'll wave my arms so he walks toward me is an elemental considered a monster is that an actual blade in the game please make it an actual weapon in the game straight through i think i mean that's what reek said no he's very trustworthy yay he lied to me he's telling the truth do you like us aww do you like me i'll take it i think i'm running out of my ten minutes i need to stand up and i need to fly away from this place or else i'm going to be stranded on this side yeah that's what i'm going to do but i want to fly around to the other side what are you going to do oh he ran backwards okay i have an idea is he considered fighting us right now or is he just staring okay then i'm going to cast charm monster on the creature it is woo you love us we're really great let us pass your mama loves you very much your papa's very proud of you come on you guys nobody attack him guys if anybody touches him this is going to break can you talk magma monster you know what friends do they dance friends dance with each other we should dance yeah i guess we can go you guys see you later have you ever seen a dragon in person have you ever seen a dragon okay great there's the exit sneaking sneaking as stealthy as possible no no don't do it okay are you going okay i'm going to try to go once you're through and then she's got to go last because she's going to try and steal that dagger 13 ten well i'm unconscious oh wait no okay wait let me do my math because i have my mage armor up which means that my arcane ward is active which means i have 19 hit points on my ward yes so that means there's how many 38 minus 19 so 19 left so i'm still alive i'm going to stealthily run toward him 20 this is going to go very badly we have candles to get i'm going to hide and not fight a dragon yeah sure oh i didn't stealth very well seven everybody rolled shit oh no oh they're the only two that can bring our people back i do tell them you're sorry yeah who else is still in the room ten feet away he is i'm going to run towards him because he's still unconscious he's being dragged right i'm going to run towards him ten feet give him a greater healing potion 4d4 plus four no you roll it plus four 16 and then i'm going to use the remainder of my movement to run back into the tunnel (yelling) are you still alive good thing you got that dagger though natural 20 what happened to reeksus read it out loud attune to that shit we could rest up do you want to or we could use our hit dice if we take a short rest while she attunes we might need that later oh yeah we need to actually do that that's terrible should we sit down and heal ourselves okay no i don't think you have it all right i'm back baby can i peek through the little thing 17 plus five is 22 how far away is the throne (whispering) you guys the king is right there lots of other dudes in there too hey aluneth should we attack can i do that with you aluneth is saying destroy them i don't know yeah yeah should i do a fireball at the king an old kobold next to him i'll let her do the first attack because you get assassinate and then i'm going to fireball immediately after that fuck it fireball how many 8d6 oh jeez 24 oh plus two 26 because i'm attacking with aluneth 22 okay ooh how close are they all to each other fireball 34 oh i may have melted all of our loot that we were supposed to take back yeah he's getting his wax back that's the important part i am going to back away from the little crack in the wall and hide against the wall no all of us in this teeny crack okay i guess i will step outside of the crack and try to hide behind a mound of something (singing) guiding bolt up the butt i did mage armor so i've got 16 that hits plus two oh god he's at disadvantage though because i'm a gnome i'm very small with stunned if you hit him does it break the stun or he's-- so you guys melee attacks are auto-crits on him right now dagger dagger dagger it's an auto-crit yeah you do you have to roll to see if it hits plus the poison damage yeah that one that one okay i'm going to try and take his crown off his head since he's stunned yeah oh wait no can i use mage hand to do it is that what mage hand does 15 i got his crown i'm going to run across the room with the mage hand following behind me and start trying to bury it in wax on the other side of the room yeah well you could get a 20 isn't it it's an auto-crit oh no oh what a concentration check for the mage hand okay okay good oh no i turn and look at it right as it hits me in the face and knocks me out cold (screams) oh it cracks my glasses advantage yeah no it's a crit double it 19 19 again you said 21 yay i'm alive okay i'm going to use frost nova and try to target the fire element and the other little things that are in the room ooh 15 constitution my spell dc is 16 oh did it go up no i'm going to move i'm going to run towards the latrine are there any candles around still okay yeah at least he can't move you guys are there any more kobolds alive okay well i'm going to cast sleep at 2nd-level so that gives me 7d8 worth of hit dice to knock people out i'm thinking they're d6 but they're not
