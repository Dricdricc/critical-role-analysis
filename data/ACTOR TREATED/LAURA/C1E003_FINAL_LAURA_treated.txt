just to see if i see any kind of anything interesting i mean if this is a really old area that i've noticed it's old can i see anything cool and old around us okay so i tap my brother and go look at this do you know anything about religion let me see (all laugh) oh me too i know shit about it it's a really pretty symbol i know on a rock i don't see any cool sparkly things in the mineral deposits none of that damn it i am about the bling what oh my god what if you could die while we're sleeping ooh what was the name of the bad guy that she said thank you k'varn i'm gonna guess that's how you spell it k'vah i thought it was k'varn we're waking up we're waking up don't worry we are gonna heal you something's rumbling i wasn't paying attention on healing grog i'm not awake yet so we're awake let's heal this guy can you heal him are we awake (grunts) awake ah that was a good nap i think grog farted again keyleth-- no what we need to heal this guy we're fine heal this guy grog just wait a little bit longer you'll be okay yeah do it here how long will this take keyleth trinket gives her a massage beforehand to loosen her up there's coffee next to you you can do this keyleth you can do this oh my gosh i think it helped stop it do i get to assist since i gave him a kiss oh god save grog save grog no yes come on keyleth keyleth keyleth keyleth what what was it good job keyleth oh siri did apparently i think he shit himself while he was unconscious so that's gotta smell really wonderful right (groans) you're welcome oh why didn't i have trinket-- aw (laughs) well shit i guess we should i think we are all healed up did he heal while he was unconscious how many d12s do you get to roll you can roll four of them if you need to you can roll up to nine dice so we know which tunnel she pointed towards can i use tracking and see if i can not only see where the majority of tracks lead to but see if i can spot the halfling kima's tracks survival i do my favored enemies are dragons and demons ah screw that oh but i do wait my favored terrain is the underdark that doesn't count if it rolls onto a phone 19 is what i rolled oh okay i'm gonna stealth too natural 20 oh that really didn't count they all sucked so i rolled a 16 is that enough to actually stealth no we can't see any movement anywhere and none of that red light is lighting any of this can i go up and see if i can get one of those little red rocks nah i don't want to waste the time what do you think should i do it okay cool a lantern (whispers) tiberius does anybody know-- have we told anybody at home what that actually is we both have one it's like a walkie-talkie ew 24 ooh oh oh no you didn't notice that that's how unperceptive you are it sucked their brains out whatever it was no you're not you're still hanging out-- i'm going to put my finger in the hole lovely trinket no he's not with us i guess it seems like it's safe enough right around here right now as silently as possible you come running up brain suckers something that sucks brains i don't think i was in that class actually much worse exactly (gasps) what if k'varn is a dragon what if-- oh wait i don't know anything about that what was that symbol anyway tiberius oh so it was a good symbol okay oh so she probably did that i understand oh no you could make yourself smarter how long does it last maybe you should wait until we come across something yeah let us lead the way or whoever's smart i'm really smart how smart are you who's our smartest person who has the highest intelligence here that's true 16 but if they take you down-- if they take down your intelligence then whoever has higher intelligence-- i don't want another catatonic-- all right all right oh no this music sounds very fighty oh no yes to like boost our willpower or something (gasps) i gave you some mirrors do you remember for looking around corners it could help that's good we could put a mirror-- right so what our option is to keep moving forward then all right as quietly as possible to keep moving forward and on the lookout for anything in this ramshackle town yes oh well i thought you said it would get ruined if we took it oh well then fuck it let's pull it off it's magical possibly i take it all the goo yes thank you mm (gasps) what is it +2 enchantment to what ooh yeah go take that studded leather armor brother what did you get let me see that yeah so he just took it he already took it damn it some of these-- i remember we rolled charisma saving throws though for the umbers they were charisma all right oh yeah let's go let's keep on moving all right i'm still tracking looking for anything interesting oh shit hey everybody calm down sh there's something moving in the distance oh god roll a stealth check (gasps) natural 20 matt and you rolled a six he rolled a six (whispers) sh figures can we scout ahead we're both really super stealth can we like-- this feels like the descent i don't like this you guys (whispers) oh no what do the miners look like are they-- are they docile or are they-- do they seem to be fighting back grog goes by himself yes i mean how many are there like ten or so and they have a light source with them so we can definitely see them we have two options we can fight them or follow them i think we follow them we gotta wait 'til they cross it scanlan she's trying to do that i've got an idea i run back to grog stealthed i get our flying carpet gimme the carpet the carpet gimme the carpet and him we can both go on the carpet we just gotta see where they're going we'll come back and get you all right scanlan oh yeah okay so we have an endless rope with us okay so we-- scanlan you better be stealthed oh you can hear the rope we're going next to the bridge i think we should go down below the bridge all right fine fuck it go above them i thought we were still stealthed 17 keeping a good distance yeah so we need to stay kind of out of it but see it it is good dialogue about how many people does it look like-- i mean how big is this camp (whispers) oh shit oh no how are we-- what are we gonna do what are we gonna do (sings) a whole new world (whispers) okay so-- okay okay well one of us well one of us let's put down no no no how are we like-- at a place where we can land the carpet and stand around or should we go back okay are there any-- does it look like-- do we see any cavern openings in the vicinity does it look like there's any but they're blocking it or-- how far away is the camp from that oh so we can't get to that what about-- do we see any closer-- under the bridge are there any openings underneath the bridge that look like-- yeah (whoosh) excuse me what are we gonna do scanlan all right i'm down should we do it we drop him off should one of us protect him i mean we can't go invisible we can't be as like-- he's sneaky we can't be as invisible as him all right okay all right i go back thanks thanks for sending me back i go back (gasps) yeah we have oh god (whispers) we can't fight these guys oh god did you choose languages oh god oh no that's a good roll yo ooh maybe he can tell us while we are taking a bathroom break what are we going to do has anyone come across these creatures before these weird tentacle brain guys a mind flayer no grog do you want to be unconscious again we have to be careful here how many dwarves did it sound like there were locked in that prison cell holy moly you guys you guys are amazing ah thank you i was wanting some ice tea (gasps) what do we do at least they'll have to go one at a time or two at a time across the bridge well i mean can he fly or can he levitate okay i like this plan or scanlan-- or what if you let off a stink bomb in the middle of the camp some of them would try to leave across the bridge yes tiberius speak your mind let's try it but you've got feather fall you've got feather fall is that still a thing but levitate or something-- but we could tie a rope to you and it can-- -- it makes you really light and we can just drag you behind us yeah it'll work in case we destroy the bridge and you can fly trinket too of course let's do it do it i feel like we should try to-- wait wait that's true maybe we could create a distraction and bring them away from the tunnel's entrance and we can just sneak around them no oh no he's trying to kill us all right it's not-- yeah yeah can you send a card that looks like a dragon on the other side in the tunnel and then they run towards us you can make the chasm look like it's solid ground make the big chasm look like solid ground they'll fall off the edge you better run fast and not get taken (laughs) it's a big rug on your back it's a big-ass rug it'd be like carrying a-- you you're not-- no just him but he's got a rug he's got the flying carpet no we're gonna chop it when they start coming across the bridge we're hoping that they're gonna just fall off the edge instead our side oh okay he can cut through that all right all right (laughs) yeah no grog isn't going tiberius is going oh my god what if you-- what oh my god yes are there any big rock formations that i can sort of use as a shelter and kind of stay behind that but also peek around oh on the goblin side i want to be on our side no i thought we were all on the other side of the bridge you're on the war camp side we're on the goblin side yeah can she fly oh you can turn into a bird how long does your spell cast i mean your spell last shut up your illusion spell so maybe you should do that-- so how far does it reach okay (whispers) wait no make it look like it's really far-- (yells) it looks very realistic oh god (laughs) oh fuck (all laugh) oh gosh i will find you oh god what are the other ones oh my god not yet not yet not yet oh my gosh oh god oh gosh right run run away (gasps) you're already back you're at the bridge badass (all cheer) shit can we-- does our aim reach our ranged attacks do they reach do ranged attacks reach i can at least try right fail so hard get on it now (gasps) oh good oh no clean your gun clean your gun i am i'm ready it's too far no fly down get him get him what try to grab him try to grab him no no no can we see this all happening off to the side keyleth you lost our flying carpet you unconscious bastard vax and i run over to vax and i'm like trying to figure out what's wrong with him oh no oh good no wait-- at the-- oh man right in the noggin can you shoot him again yeah but wait you can shoot him while he's on the ground can't you he's on the ground fudge what're you gonna do all of our shit's gone maybe we can-- can we walk up and see-- -- if we can find another bridge oh 20 no no assistance needed plus my perception my perception is six (gasps) oh my god we have infinite rope i'm gonna tie it to myself-- no-- aww oh all right (gasps) it's water down there marisha and no you don't it's 1000 feet down it's 1000 feet do you want to die you're being incredibly childish don't do that don't dive 1000 fucking feet water how far down from the bridge well look we know-- we can't get over there oh the thing is-- the thing is we know that-- -- deeper down is where they've gone so probably it'd be best to go down we could have avoided all of this bullshit if we'd just have known-- right gets pulled under wait but we're gonna have to go down eventually so okay well everybody keeps saying that everything is deeper and deeper so i think we're gonna have to go-- -- deep down eventually yeah it can grab us exactly the tunnel doesn't go that high yeah it can grab us from there but the tunnel oh-- (quietly) i think we should go down kima maybe okay if i go down there-- -- and look in one of the tunnels-- -- can i look in one of the tunnels and see if i find tracks if i do can we go that way i've got a flying carpet there's tunnels that don't have lava flowing into them exactly there is a tunnel that we can walk in yes please scanlan let me look for tracks please tracks in a tunnel it is yes okay okay oh all right fine let's do whatever you guys want to do water holes it's four against us anyway we gotta go that way ugh no and trinket no then i can't carry grog i think we should go
