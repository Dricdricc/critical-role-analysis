merchandise i've been organizing my dice while you guys were talking and so now i'm set in the store we have things available for you to buy and-- i'm not as good at this as sam is okay so the rings there's two sizes left there's six and seven so if you have little itty-bitty fingers you can still get one the patches are out of stock sorry people but i'm proud of everybody that got one the nail wraps are still there the mugs are still there and the pins and the wristbands that travis is wearing right now-- those are available for pre-order for one more day as of 500pm i think our time california time they're going to be out of the store he's been wearing it every day it does not-- it doesn't smell that bad yeah i know the nail wraps-- only some a few left in stock that's good we said like five hours is what i-- i pop trinket out aw buddy you're tough do we see any tracks are there tracks able to be left on the glass i'm trying to see where the people went survival 18 okay what do your eagle eyes see grog what's the possibility that ripley can make herself invisible it sounded like you said petri-fried i start taking my broom and swinging it around me to see if i hit anything that's invisible does the wind seem strong enough that if i hopped up on my broom that i would get blown away okay i want to try doing that then look at the water it looks like waves did i get in the air before initiative or-- okay like 20 feet thank you trinket's going to be so useful against a tornado yeah of course really anything you're an eagle ten yay oh no you're going to be the most useful one too it's okay it's power play right at the end (singing) it takes two baby guess i should have gone higher what oh that's nicer 15 cyclone of death yeah it's also got a thing on it that hooks to me that percy made it's like a surfboard when you shoot a whirlwind yeah scanlan can probably turn you back once you get over there you're went 100 feet up travis grog i feel like lightning is good because it turns glass into-- and stab the whirlwind it is that was so close to a one 28 oh no there's two more is that a hit point ring that's badass me ow ugh i stand up for my movement okay hunter's mark that motherfucker yeah the big one and then i'm going to shoot him twice with fenthras which is the first time i've actually shot a real arrow for this one okay please hit 27 on the first hit natural one on the second motherfuck 16 a natural one is-- okay cool that's awesome great so wait that's a d8 plus a d4 for lightning that's a ten jesus wait ten plus ten is 20 i know 23 four of them is lightning what yeah i'm establishing that and then trinket can do his moves can i use the rest of my movement to get back up on the broom and go up in the air get 30 feet in the air this time maybe okay oh roll damage is it possible to go higher to get above the wind wall it's saving its whirlwind attack how many hit points do you start with percy sick make the wind your bitch wow what oh you phony oh you haven't leveled up (laughs and imitates yelp) of course it has taliesin can i fly over it so that i can shoot down onto it then as my bonus action i'm going to have trinket run up and attack it yeah trinket's going to bite it 26 14 hit points for trinket 17 for my hit and then the next one hits it's higher okay i know 20 points for the first one oh plus sneak attack 24 points two of those are lightning (counting) 14 and then-- oh i don't get that that time 14 points for the second one me i missed i rolled a one 22 it looks like she dragged whatever she found further into the island can i call trinket over and then look at the tracks and see if he smells anybody and see where they took everything 15 for me should i roll for trinket too for his smell perception oh okay i was seeing if he could catch their scent and he's got advantage on smell 25 waterlogged for sure you also have that dog they can maybe team up and have extra-strong smell perception or we can save it oh well i'll do one too do you have a strong heal all right i'll do a 2nd-level and i'll touch your face so i can heal all the little glass shardy things 17 for me yeah totally scanlan take a greater and a regular healing potion percy take a greater and a regular can you pass the spyglass over i think that would be great on the broom i'm going to keep this spyglass ooh can i fly up in the air and look through it down at the ground see what i see do i get advantage because of the spyglass 24 what if i follow from where the path that i saw them dragging and i follow through the trees can i see a path inward from there are they magic can we arcane them arcane check no grog don't eat it is that what we saw oh so he wasn't a magic user i take the purple one you take the red one why do i take them both i'll keep the purple one he wants one of those balls to put in his butt grog please don't stomp that is not okay i'm keeping my senses aware for if ripley's invisible and is around us 28 ooh 30 is it broken glass or smooth glass i have a couple vials of poison can i dip a few arrows in the poison does that make poison arrows (whispering) be as quiet as fucking possible i'm going to be behind him yeah i'm going to stay behind him how much farther ahead are you going that always works out every time go for it (quietly) go for it what well i figure when i go too stealthy i pop him in my necklace but okay yeah for stealthy times what's going on what are we doing (quietly) what do we do charge in guns blazing but we're not rested you're creating a distraction why doesn't scanlan create the distraction i think scanlan fucking distract and we all charge in like motherfuckers i guess i pop trinket out and i get up on the bow i mean on the broom i sit on my bow then i realize that i'm-- i'm going to fly up to the top of a tree and try to be high up oh my god that's right he speaks i thought it was good dog oh that's not his real name what is his name does it say it on the card i wanted to be hiding up in a tree i fire we all fire i'm going to shoot a bramble shot at her yeah then i'll try a regular shot since i can't see her i don't want to waste my bramble shot 22 goddamn it the other one misses too no oh you're releasing it you're doing it while he's talking i want to fly on a closer tree so i can get a better shot at her i want to hide behind one of the branches of the tree 26 who 32 oh god things are falling ooh we both get it quiet i can't hear anything matt's saying oh no 15 trinket was on the ground wasn't he dexterity 21 for trinket 21 good because if he had taken the full thing he would have been unconscious oh so they are there how deep is the crevasse 17 jump over her prone form can i say how much i wish pike was here right now where am i well i stand up what are those circles next to trinket what are those would i be able to hide behind that okay i'll do that and dash and hide behind the tree well i want to get behind the tree so it's still coverage right then can i shoot from there is anything in range i don't know it doesn't say the guy that grog hit is outside of my range i'm going to shoot at the guy closest to me i want to be able to peek out shoot and then duck back behind the tree what okay i don't know what you want that is a 30-something 32 what 21 what the fuck man that was the female warrior i'm not shooting at the other one dude no i'm going to shoot her again 18 doesn't hit her 22 on that one oh and the last two had four points of lightning damage on both of them i duck back behind the tree could i have had trinket run over to the tree where percy is i thought it was a group spell is it not traps and spells that's good damn it that's at eye level natural 20 20d6 20d6 what level spell is that could he have misty-stepped closer to us she's a bitch and his rifle's broken misfire ugh i hate her liam and look did you see how happy he was about this that was the most satisfied smile i've seen from matt in a really long time me oh for a bonus action i'm going to take a greater healing potion i'm going to do that at the end though okay i'm going to peek out who's seeable is the guy that i've been shooting-- yeah i'm going to shoot him that is a 30 15 that's with one lightning damage and then i'll do it again that's a fun thing fuck i can't add 23 17 points with three lightning damage jeez they're all still standing oh and then i'm going to take my potion i ducked back behind that tree after i shot by the way i ducked back behind the tree when i shot that person personally i was flung yeah move it towards where ripley was unless if it hits ripley does she defuse it no we can't kill kynan i can't kill kynan and i apparently can't kill anyone today wow that is so high just think if it had been percy he would have thrown up it's like dragonball z fighting now can you ride on bigby's hand through it do you have any healing bonus actions i'm really low i have no idea cool the dice sticks to the magnets on the boxes oh shit no no no you're zero now now it's just death saving throws take it from us we've been unconscious a lot (laughter) (gasps) yes yeah kynan kynan doesn't get hit (singing) six oh my god oh my god we're going to die six (gasps) trinket is unconscious no no if he's unconscious he goes straight into my pokeball if i'm within 100 feet yeah because scanlan went unconscious good that's good evening out the odds as we all go unconscious they all go unconscious does she fall into the 20-foot crevasse how many points did you take that's it just 15 points that's it oh you poor thing he's still like almost a hundred hit points that's okay you'll roll a natural 20 anyway how is that sad you're touching him how can you
