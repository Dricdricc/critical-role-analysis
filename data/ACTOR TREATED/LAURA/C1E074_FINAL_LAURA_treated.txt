just hanging out what's this dude they were so good and they give really good background into our characters what animal was that yes so our critical costumes contest we are announcing the winners after the break no we have all been looking at them we all have our personals but now we have to fight amongst ourselves and duke it out for the winner they are amazing victor cat critter critters when does it start yeah he's old school he's old school he's off-camera laughing at us we should go to fort daxio then and talk to them by the fabulous keyleth can you scry here though we are by the orb of death yeah we are totally going to fort daxio that's where we are going to amass our forces potentially we do my shit father yeah he knew somebody there but i don't remember who it was oh oh what about that guy that was running the refugee camp the leader bernard or reginald or-- not reginald what was his name bernard the guy who was running the refugee camp that was like a blacksmith not a blacksmith but he had stepped up to-- no yeah we found his brother his son they were heading to fort daxio weren't they yeah well they're empty right now but you know who i'm talking about yeah cornelius is allura still here is allura still around allura do you know anyone in fort daxio right shit no the army remember part of the army got sent to syngorn and then syngorn bamfed away this is a lot of work should we just fucking go there i don't know if he knows army people yeah that's true are there trees are there lots of trees it's grassland one why one it seems like a really long process-- well one of us goes there finds a tree and then bamfs back and keyleth brings us all over-- fabulous send one of us over there oh how perfect we're good great kima can we take kima no this is perfect yeah it's fine let's just go wow that is way bigger than i expected it to be wow have we ever rolled this oh my god you've got really good animal handling is it a dick does it look like anybody's in the fort looking down at us are we far enough away fucking shit balls 16 all right it's shit-balls up there just lots of shit we're not bringing the fight here oh shit we are that's the plan that's my plan daxio's who's in syngorn no it is and we have got allura with us she's on the council super good but they might be skittish so we should probably have a little protection as we go up there dudes i think their commanding officers are in syngorn for the most part sure they didn't even check us out just letting us in be on your guard they're too trusting never mind they're in syngorn as far as we know elle gorgofon 50 people toilet paper (laughter) can we see what it is it looks like dark folded material general how many soldiers does this fort support and how many can be here yeah (quietly) all right in your warmaster's defense it might be beyond his control to get back here and he's stuck in the feywild the warmaster here yeah mikael maybe throw some food through a tree when we open it up just chuck some corn take some spaghetti sorry you've been under him for how long 15 years long time that was a good catch we're hoping we'll be able to bring mikael and syngorn's army back as well not even a little bit three down do you have underground facilities something that guards against dragon fire how many non-functional it could happen when was the last time ancient dragons took over the land the montage we need some source of water too could they have something with veggies too though isn't there something that turns the land fertile it's a sizzler i like it (phone ringing) oh you did we have to right i don't know how we send word to the feywild without going to the feywild didn't we do underground stuff in whitestone too though do they disappear when they're dead oi maybe we should pop into syngorn but yeah we'll fly up let's do that because it's on the cliffside right (sings) from a distance (shouts) it looks peaceful up here what are we doing do we see anything interesting that seems useful for like if we put something on the cliffside or something maybe a hideout somewhere to hide from view something like that almost awesome 19 is it a mountain is it favored terrain yeah 20 we could put somebody in a hidey-hole up here and if they see anything they drop a stone down to a designated area and let people know oh yeah we have those a bell is probably the best idea oh because your little wings are dead all right i'll float us down on my ever-flying broom i go down pretty slow to make this last a little bit longer what to take out all of this yeah that's right oh that was so close to a one but it wasn't 20 oh wait no 26 my math was wrong there's still no veggies huh they could probably use some vegetable nutrition do they or is it like a chicken broth that they boil them in deep in there oh percy number one (whispers) never say whitestone in public ever or allura to the feywild but how would we get back maybe syngorn will have control over that they can transfer back when they want to they have a huge army i don't know how we'll be able to get word to them all right well we have to get armies here that's what we're trying to do they were wandering somewhere specific though into the riverlands or something we'll spread the fuck out and then thordak will attack and then none of us will be here -ish yeah bottom of the list because i don't think they would-- yes and that's a biggie because it's also got these soldiers also there we can howl bahamut yeah we've got that whistle what about bahamut's people in vasselheim yeah what about the platinum sanctuary oh i thought you were talking about-- sorry grog you're so smart yeah it's so close i think so i don't know i think they just wanted out of those woods but-- maybe we could find artagan while we're there maybe he could pop over and we'll have an archfey helping us a jillion as many as we can is that it is that everyone vasselheim this is a lot of different places in like a day and a half yeah and hopefully they'll show up like game of thrones at the last moment we'll think we're overrun and then all of a sudden another army shows up and it's wonderful oh this is major this is huge remember demons in the succubus' house well let's send word to them then save us the talk yes it's got to be somebody she knows have you ever met somebody in charge in kraghammer yeah they have fassbender wow nice pull yeah she is the clasp well who do you know that's really powerful that also maybe has an army that could help us anyone you know that we don't they're dicks aren't they oh that one guy we met he was a real dick though purple eyes he was in marquet is that what we're thinking of am i thinking of a different place just kidding yes if they could get pop syngorn over to fort daxio that'd be killer no no tell them to be on guard on the airship or send them through a tree i don't know if that will help at all yeah he's protecting everyone oh my god is this happening right now she goes back we're like-- it might be smart to send one to warmaster mikael as well i know he's in syngorn as well but it might be good to have a couple of people there bringing word they hate us but-- if the dragon leaves the city yeah they're just resistant to fire are they vulnerable to anything that i know of of the dawn martyr which might be clutch for you we'd have to spend the night there fuck really right you'd have to ask raishan oh fuck asum was going to come back fuck some other guy was it some other guy well it's still a day it hasn't been a day yet we haven't spent the night here yet somebody's got to go well all right that's the goal we kill the peons and then he comes that's why we need to have a lot of people here to fight them that's what we talked about all right allura can you send a message to gilmore or cassandra or kima even maybe just those three they're the only ones who know about raishan let them know that raishan is bringing back asum i know but just to make sure everything's fine with that no what are we going to do she's not going to come would you want to go allura all right okay then you stay here and keep running things is this stupid are we going to die in the fire plane but there's a vestige there for pike the thing is thordak's going to send out look-sees like he did over whitestone as soon as he finds out umbrasyl is dead it doesn't mean he'll launch an attack because where is he going to attack he doesn't know where we are we just bamf right back if you hear back from anyone in syngorn or anyone anywhere will you send us a message pretend like we were never here let them know pretend like we were never here all right we are so stupid this is going to be fun no it's a tree stride no i think we should because they were there can you plane shift us over to the ashari it has to be to another plane just something little so that we can pop to the tree oh yeah so let's fucking do it look at that keyleth there's so many more people than you thought wasn't the ember seed connected to the-- didn't we knock down some pillars when we came to the fire plane the last time isn't that part of the reason his hold was broken right but remember we were here for your-- okay maybe you just thought that and were freaking out a bit is it a large city it feels like it's going to be really hard yeah whatever we're doing even if we're in the middle of fighting some really big fire elementals we just-- scanlan will you be able to do the mansion inside of the fire plane or did you already use it-- no i mean but did you already use it today does everything over there fight with fire the city of brass sucks but we'll be okay going there ish in and out thank you so much can i say while this whole talk's been going on that i've been unattuning my coldsnap armor and reattuning my bracers of archery can i ask you a question if i have two bows that are awesome and i'm attuned to both of them how easy is it to switch in a battle yeah if i chose to attune to the sky sentinel and fenthras instead of the bracers it'd be an action to switch them out in a battle cool hey that all happened in a millisecond i was considering things in my brain oh right with the announcement of our winners yeah because we've been looking at the hashtag like crazy my personal choice was @sara-rokhov i don't know if i said that right but she did the costume that was closest to the outfit that we wore in the opening credits which is really cool because i know that's really intricate and i saw the sleeves there was crazy pleated sleeves happening on that costume it was awesome upper crust that was so cool good concept so good close up on all of us looking at each other like who's

know what fuck it i'm going to put the 20-pound bag of gems in his hand the world is fucking ending you guys how else am i going to use these things scanlan i think you let a little bit of scry on the ground there fuck oh wait because i took a spell locate object oh okay right how many miles is the city maybe we should ask somebody not necessarily act really fucking tough dude 15 let's find that armor yeah we walk the fuck forward should we get a little farther into the city or should i cast it right now oh wow that might be the worst shirt you've ever worn on the show wow as long as you know nothing attacks us right that's clutch flying creatures here maybe wyverns or something a teeny tiny efreeti tieflings can we also keep an eye out for anything flying i want to see if anything's flying around the city at all no warning huh are they looking and talking to each other at all what does avian mean oh got it harry potter okay oh intelligence ew eight that's a fucking bird y'all ah natural 20 on the-- every time get a little closer i'm going to try to keep a little closer to the two in the front and try to see if i can overhear their conversation at all if they talk this is like when your friends start to drink at the ren faire and you're like should we keep going forward or what do we do do we wait oh no oh it's at disadvantage come on keyleth oh shit okay i go i don't know i don't fucking know so it's me and you are you coming are you still in the middle dart to the right i go the efreeti behind us are they paying attention to us or are they completely distracted by all of the-- anything oh god do they know they're being dominated come on keyleth you got it get up and run you guys you better fucking run away it's crazy city people fight all the time we're heading towards an alleyway do we need to hide let's go as far away out of sight as we can i think that's the option everybody's running for their lives right now sorry hi how are you not slaves right now sorry can i climb up on one of the boxes to give more foot room i pick up scanlan and put him up on a box yes this is true why do you wear those white robes do they signify anything whoa you've got really high insight magic and i think magical beasts is this your room whose room is it i want to look in his eyes as we are about to go through and see if-- how honest he looks 21 hey my eyes are down-- all right i like your hair and i walk in i walk up and smack percy on the ass and say feel like making a home here and walk past him how long does locate object take to cast can i try to cast it as we sit down and see if it's in our vicinity well it's a 2nd-level spell so i can do it a bit tight tight tight did he hang out around here hmm anywho what powers can you do a trinket really nothing huge somebody won it in a game of poker i believe cards i don't think so do people under subjugation own a lot where's uten what's uten doing he seems totally chill this is the way this dude talks all the fucking time (laughing) do you require monetary compensation or is it something more should we make ourselves not look like us should we maybe look like something different in which case take your pick don't you have any white robes you can give us instead check out those chains and see if they're magic you can get big and then look like an efreeti maybe somebody that is better at talking i want to put them on but i don't want to click them i want to hang them and make them look like they're attached but i don't want to attach them 11 you're going to blow your little hands off
