start a fight that's going to start a fight oh shit where are you off to now lovely oh good allura we haven't seen her in forever have we we did shit yes we did never mind good job we should put that hide in the treasury the 140 pounds of dragonhide you're carrying right now yeah we've got a couple hours it won't be if asum has anything to say about it improvise we're good at that i hate knowing that she's going to be able to hear all of our plans yes all right it's got scales all over it i mean that stays right it doesn't have to be kept cold kept cold would it be an armorer or a blacksmith or-- who works with dragonhide is there a tanner in whitestone he's cheating on you keyleth (shushing) not just yet yeah we need to find kashaw before the meeting yes kash (loudly) are you sleeping i'm going to jiggle the lock is it locked i open it just a crack and look in shh should we let him sleep or should we talk to him he snores you know my brother doesn't snore no just don't just don't do i have any like stones or any like rocks or anything in my bag or-- yeah just to see if he wakes up well i don't want to kill him i'll sneak in tap his shoulder come back out see if he wakes up i don't want him to know that you know-- i want to sneak in and tickle his little foot and walk out shit all right i tickle his hands tickle his hands and then go back really fast to the doorway fucking-- i flick his nose i know it's awkward laura and oh good i was wondering if-- okay ooh that sounds big they're so hard to get a hold of we should probably focus on the other one unless vorugal's already dead what would we do with these contracts if he is just wondering about that your help has been-- do you want these back-- i'm going to set them down on the ground by the way you might want to get like a mouthguard or something because you snore a little keyleth we should go keyleth come here and i take her around a corner he kissed me no god no percy percival no yeah i know i mean i know you guys are like-- pretty close and i don't know if that's weird i don't know you're like his sister kind of this is true how are things with you and vax thanks for bringing it up is it good i care of course i care i hug her well not your antlers in my face hey thanks we should go look at the treasury oh my god do you think he'd mind if we-- i mean we have so much money we don't even need to do that yeah no it's-- it's all good so bad sometimes they do talk about boys 5000 gold is a hundred pounds oh (laughter) i want to stay standing as well with the gate scroll that we showed you actually allura is everything okay have you been through some shit allura just pop on over to emon then do you want to offer yourself as bait i don't know how we would use it we can't touch it you think i feel like raishan would only know how to open up a portal what how the fuck are we going to fight him we're sending ourselves as well how long did it take you allura to create that heart six months how do we get armies there but they're just townsfolk march on emon if we gather our forces thordak will notice bless you do you think it's overtaking him it's huge maybe all the evil things in the fire plane are gone right now and they're with thordak that is a shame a real shame shit's going down did an airship ever arrive an airship did anyone see an airship flying around mm-hmm that would be good yes yeah it's really far away and then as we were leaving the people that we talked to about it-- but we need to know the ritual we've got allura and gilmore and drake whitestone's about to be destroyed why would he he doesn't-- that's different taliesin oh god are you going to leave that on the whole time just the helmet that's good you're good now i've just been staring at allura either way we can now ask about the ritual that's crazy will he know it was us so what if we kill you how does thordak know you're alive what if he sends you out and we kill you we do it to everyone don't worry doesn't always turn out well percival raishan now that we know you're you do you have to continue the ruse of being asum or can you bring him here maybe you could pop him over then just for a little bit you're quite powerful i want to hear what's going on with the clasp i want to see for myself that he's alive i'm a dragon too (evil laugh) you thought you were going to stab him that was not a play no tricks not long cassandra and if we had told any of you your life would have been in danger mm-hmm oh yes i think if we give her access to thordak's body afterwards we're asking for a lot of trouble question what if we do actually just kill her when we fake that we're killing her what if we kill her should we continue this conversation downstairs (gasps) no are the walls still like people they're really clean naked bodies now where it should have been happening it's true she actually revealed her entire form during the battle which is quite diseased and then we try to defeat her after that but we have to beat her to it if she gets a hold of that stone-- yes are you suggesting we put the vortex of doom inside one of us right no way to transport it none at all think about it if we could get that stone next to the vortex he'd be fucked this is a temple to ioun right the goddess of knowledge brom and he's in emon potentially brom's with asum you couldn't have used the gate scroll in here yeah that's what i was thinking send him in i don't know if we have a lot of time-- pike this is true well that's what we've been doing this entire time that's not a magic creature though it's a woodland being really just a fairy just a teeny little fairy potentially we'll find out (copying marisha) lalittle lilittle li-- a little pixie isn't it though you don't know where it goes stab stab stab it's just an empty pyramid-y thing now wait hey allura how many things did you throw in the orb have you put a box around it just encapsulated it completely you've been waiting waiting to find a time to say it haven't you what about fort daxio fort daxio has an army gathering there already right well syngorn is gathering their forces as well we have we haven't been to fort daxio i'm sure they already have no she knows you took that shot specifically to stab her three times in the back percy i thought you were practicing honesty let's be honest raishan wants thordak dead that's her endgame as well she's not going to show up your people keyleth j'mon we could take out a contract against the red dragon we can hire them to kill a red dragon she doesn't know fort daxio she doesn't know any of that she doesn't know about j'mon sa ord they're keeping an eye out at this point all right keyleth we have to fight eventually we're not trying to be cocky about it we're trying to set up an army this is true if the opportunity arrives to take out raishan then we do it beforehand if not immediately after thordak is dead after this fight there won't be enough people to bring us back anymore (laughter) we need to figure out if fort daxio is the place to send everyone all right we got to fucking check it out beep beep right there liam and
