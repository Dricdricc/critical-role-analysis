for what you stole from me you're not even drunk did you reach the bottom (whispering) doughnuts think of something good to eat think of something magical think of poop think of jewelry that was close though think of jewelry i feel like it was i think of jewelry here's the thing i do know that with my haversack-- where is it by the way who has my haversack if you cut the haversack all of its contents spill out from the outside if you cut it from the outside if you pierce it all of its stuff falls out no it's doneskies you're injured i didn't even know is everybody injured (whispering) why was he talking to yasha caleb is slashed across his chest that worked out really well for us last time cure wounds because i'm a healer i'm a really good one i know it's pretty impressive my bag thank you caleb although it looks really good with your coat thank you i hold my bag up to caduceus-- cad's hair does it match whoa it's long is it can it hold more than mine well then it's expensive because mine was very pricey and it holds some stuff what is that whoa what happened i mean i know what happened fuck you can cook i just start scarfing you're the leader oh that's wonderful caleb i'm very proud of you we can all sleep in the same bedroom and you can put your wire thingy in front of it and then we'll know if anyone tries to break in what is it how'd you do that what is that what's

really good drawing it's like a melon with a cut in it many thanks to you-- what is that name ionos i think is what it is for dealing with the thieves who appropriated my possession reliability like this will prove profitable for you and your house should you continue to be one half of our agreed payment is enclosed-- (gasp) is that what the hundred platinum was one half of it with the other being paid upon recovery of the cloven crystal-- i think that's what this thing is it is imperative that you find this bauble and return it to me it has great sentimental value to me and my family this rendering should suffice to guide the discerning eyes of your hunters quen'pillar yeah we know that month and then he said ah when he was writing it for sure marius lepual at the wayfarer's cove for the captain evantica that is-- you guys wait somebody hired-- oops do you think somebody hired lorenzo to do this or do you think that lorenzo stole this from somebody-- do you recognize it fjord it looks kind of like a cantaloupe with a hole in it-- is that what's in your belly wait wait wait we just need to return-- do you know evantica have you ever been to the wayfarer's cove i have i've been there before yeah but he wasn't in nicodranas with me wait wait wait if we bring you there we'll get a hundred platinum you think do i have something on me would i have a glass bead it's jade
