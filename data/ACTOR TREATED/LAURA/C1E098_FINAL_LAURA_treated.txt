wait a minute what is this injustice 2 you speak of i watched a video today of you and you fighting which was pretty exciting that's crazy i play supergirl those bright lights are headache-inducing yeah oh farpoint came out so if you have playstation virtual reality system then you can get farpoint and i play dr eva tyson on it and it's actually a really freaking cool game you shoot things with a gun and it was a really cool script and stuff i liked the story a lot i've never done it oh no and you're doing it as tary is the helmet attuned it is isn't it too bad but we can just steal all of his jewels just for the sake of it so did we already say that because next week is a battle royale that means our hundredth episode-- okay you already said that was i busy rolling dice and talking korshad the many is who we want to speak to all right i'm definitely going to sit on the ones that are just for decor cool going to rub my butt all over it do you have fermented juice i'd rather not how did it go is she still a raging bitch not even for people who could help them with their name that's a very good point no we're not drunk we may have just had a little bit of wine just a small amount that's your plan don't sacrifice your entire life for this though do the truscans that's who you are being married into potentially do they have a son i guess it's not the same is it of course i know everything about royalty sure let's talk to the mob tary of course we will you know what an adjective is that's impressive should we go to the grumpy lily then this is going so well out the house like get out fine how's your mother wow all right to the laughing ninny it is just dive in then all three really does it look like there's any seams in the ground that would be a trapdoor or anything 17 oh you can keep going that's true (laughing) do you need any help nobody's just old impressive i give him two gold you're welcome sir on your way to the back could you tell the many we'd like to speak to them oh just a conversation with the many no yeah we'll definitely keep those running ahead turning around i want to pay attention to what key he's taking sploosh yes that she is i'll look for people hiding 24 okay you'll hang behind me tary pike is with grog yeah it's like you in japan baby we went into mcdonald's and his head hit the ceiling well no we could stand here for ten minutes yeah start it now just do it while we're walking thanks thanks keyleth that felt good that was a nice trip down memory lane oh hey how's it going there do you feel inspired no we're here to speak to the many we're going to just go on in then the good stuff is down here thank you do we see room for a large group all right split up no let's not do that yeah obviously right all right this is about as in as we get with the many yeah he or she may not reveal themselves too quickly that is a beautiful idea care of one taryon darrington oh we'll cover the drink darling party funds cover the drink it's just in your name can we grab a barmaid do we recognize any semblance of that garb well my history is shit but 19 you said it was to the east it is now oh oh man that's right now you have to stick to what you wrote that's crazy maybe some of us don't smell very good in this group i'm not one of them though i smell amazing i guess all of us can sit at the table because of the people-- no probably whiskey she can drink most people under the table i nudge him under the table what does he like oh i was planning on totally watching that too should i roll too well yeah okay 30 i'm keeping an eye on the side of the room that he glanced in looking for anybody going and delivering drinks to the people can i read his lips the change-bringer's nectar ooh i'll take that on charisma checks i like it it can't get any nicer than it already is gross that makes me want an empanada right now he's in the middle of a conversation right now let him take some time oh no pike just tiny sips drink some maybe some water too in between each sip hey tary just calm down this is mainly what i'm trying to tell you right now stop being so weird it might actually help you just a little bit and don't look sneaky yeah seriously just have a little sip a little sip it's always good to relax your nerves yeah jauntily that's good yeah okay maybe stop i'm just afraid he's going to look over here at any moment i'm keeping an eye on good old korshad and seeing if he looks over here i also want to see if i can catch his lips and see what he's talking about over on the side there of course he fucking does i do too what are you doing you don't have to do that yeah that one's good just this that's it pike pike's got it he's definitely going to come over and talk to us now i can feel it we're so cool you charmed her that's what i planned on doing is waiting out that conversation i in no way want to interrupt it i want to get one of those fancy drinks for myself and see what it is i want one of the korshad drinks i'll go up to the bar we don't know his name do we the bartender's name of course darling i didn't catch your name wence thank you so much could i grab another of those fabulous five-gold drinks there that you brought to our friend i don't know what is it i'm going to give it a go slowly but surely marking little amounts off this party fund y'all it's like brushing your teeth only you get drunk foul i'm learning that he probably has minty fresh breath yeah but mine's in an ugly cup do you have one pull it out do you really have a jewel-encrusted-- you do in your fucking bag of holding sweet i'm going to clean that shit out pour it in this is gorgeous taryon you drink out of this one yeah you're the one that bought him the drink look like you're drinking it too how is it do you like it i know can i go over and talk to wence one more time actually no i give him five gold no i'd rather not no i was just wondering do you know how long korshad usually hangs out here every night always with the same company or different people oh wow would you mind going over to him and just letting him know that the gentleman who bought him the drink would love a moment of his time taryon darrington he needs to know the name no rush but make sure it happens i walk over and put my hand on taryon's shoulder and keep eye-contact with korshad you said that over the earring okay oh please join us yes for the sake of this i'm going to move my hands but just know my hands are here the whole time okay i'm sure you're familiar with taryon here and you are familiar with his father as well we've heard tell of recent situations with his family and you and we were hoping we could come to an agreement well i don't know if you've heard of vox machina and i'm well aware that someone like you could find a good use for someone like us potentially if it could help clear the darrington name 230000 gold if we're hearing correctly so would the darringtons simply work for you and past that point they would be in no debt to you if we take care of this for you it does seem like a monumental task from what we've learned ancient beings tend to be quite powerful we would ask that you don't slander the darrington name that when they stay in their estate everyone believes they are still the darringtons as they have always been there's always a choice dear do we need to decide at this moment the diviner would be wonderful to speak to good yeah you're going to go by yourself i think you're good always have your back dear three let's go on the way out can i grab wence again one last time most of the people here are they local patrons or do they come from all over great thank you it's all i needed nice yeah we need to camp because we need to rest and get our shit back herethis i mean do we know anything have we ever heard about the woods of herethis or the platinum mines of herethis oh man no but really that's where the battles took place huh so this ancient being could be from potentially-- yeah if we die we die don't say it keyleth do not fucking say it don't say it about all of us and doom us to your fate oh shit i would like to point out that this same person you are so adamantly protecting from our scrying or our spying or our finding is the same person who shit in the middle of a temple so that he could watch pike i just realized i have the other half of the stone the traveling stone i could pop in on him anytime i want that would be really really shit if he did that exalted no but seriously what are we doing i don't think we use that mercenary to walk into a mine i'm not sending her to her death no we go ask her how to hire her oh well he writes me all the time but outside of that (laughs) i have so many secrets to keep dear so many it really does we go find-- (laughs) definitely never to be heard from again because we'll forget that we have that connection (laughter) misty step tonight and then that way we can recover everything let's misty step there-- oh sorry yeah i don't want to camp right next to the-- did you get it i think a cure wounds a light cure wounds would probably help we'll land a little bit away let's land a little bit away were the bodies on top or were the bodies down below pike can do that i'll go with pike and we can stealth in she can't talk to them as mist oh okay i'll cast pass without a trace anyways so we'll be stealthy going in so i do that and me okay you're still out there oh gods i'm going to get my broom ready and while pike is doing her ritual i'm just going to keep a hand on her that if anything happens then i can just take off with her in tow like downward dog oh what's that called it's okay good start skittering beasts (whispering) what did the skitterers look like oh in my drink yeah but that's really big the skittering creatures that's already three questions i didn't hear something about his spit what did he say what's the smaller one yeah i don't think that's what it is yeah did the pincers sound like something we have fought though before nature check do i get advantage because i'm standing in the woods six oh i wonder if we could sprinkle it around us and they won't bother us because we'll smell like their brethren hey man it's an idea yes we definitely should have a heroes' feast maybe you can ask where the thing is in the mine it's just straight down at the bottom of it yeah then you might survive that one only if you turn into a goldfish and fall onto the ground it's fine what are ankhegs are they fiends aberrations we're about to fight some big armored vaginas did we understand correctly that it's the baby that cried out is the big monster the big boss okay and that's the thing that woke up the skitterers okay i just wanted to make sure it wasn't like there's a big boss and then there's skitterers and then there's also little babies that cry out no we don't know what woke up the baby maybe we should talk to another dead person they're not miners natural 20 no i haven't rolled i'm trying to make myself roll it (gasps) oh my god i rolled a natural 20 it's like run lola run where she's doing the roulette thing and she's like-- how yeah we're camping but we should camp in the trees y'all not in the ground in case the things come up out oh man 15 oh wait i honestly don't know anymore what my favored terrain does for me i always feel like i'm bullshitting it now what am i rolling investigation 24 hey this is a place let's do it here all right yay heroes' feast advantage on wisdom we're losing our 17 if you give us a speech how long does that last oh wait but does that mean we lose our temporary hit points on the heroes' feast tight he's giving you a look you're going to get better at it keyleth just add that to the 19 then but the 19 we can heal to kerr bear oh no it wasn't kerr bear it was tova don't you already have that with your-- oh yeah that one that's right oh hey well no maybe would this be a bad idea to shoot an oracle arrow down into the bottom well we have this method that we used to do light the arrow on fire and then send it down so i can see by the light of the fire on it i don't think so that's true he does he does heal people a lot wait should i cast pass without a trace on us no i'm going to do the oracle arrow first oh what if we wake it up when i shoot it down and things come out i like this idea i'm going to cast pass without a trace on all of us just to be safe so we can stealth and be quiet yeah but they'll just keep falling won't they how does that work it will make the most glorious bacon all right i'm setting my arrow on fire and i'm shooting it down into the pit that was helpful super helpful that's true i didn't see the great baby beast down at the bottom potentially in that small circle okay so we could take the flying carpet down a couple of people could fly we can take the flying carpet down you think the skitterers are going to come out of the walls it may be good to blind them if they dwell under the surface we have a flying carpet two brooms a set of wings up and out yes you can the only people we need to get on it are percy and pike everybody else can fly unless keyleth is out of-- hop on the broom yeah all right because you got that down in the fucking nine hells right that is so crazy this is just the stupidest we're sticking to the middle oh shit flying carpet ooh shit and add ten y'all 39 don't land and we're whispering we're whispering but we're not whispering so that people can hear we're definitely whispering over-- can i look too 22 is it emitting light is it like an orc should we just nuke it should we just nuke that thing oh it was like a coffin does it look like a coffin a teeny bit abyssal draconic yeah they're human they can't see shit should we cast some light down here and we back away from the thing advantage on oh shit wow it's cool-looking oh shit we're right by the baby oh that's the baby oh it's a mean baby i feel like it could be saved because it's-- i feel bad because it's a baby 12 i'm so far below you in the initiative though whoa good job kill that celestial baby get all the bacon oh no we're in its lair thanks for coming right next to me on that one goddamn it what am i doing a constitution nine a giant baby rattle that's directly in front of it oh yeah i'm resistant to cold travis just reminded me i have cold resistance because of my vorugal armor does that mean i roll again for-- oh okay so that was 17 okay so add nine back did beacon of hope get everybody death saving throw is huge and healing is huge you're next to the big white thing you got this you got this pike what is it you have to get above half of the damage you took is that what it is oh good roll what is this considered underdark or a dungeon get it he needs a nap yeah i'm frozen yay you could enlarge maybe you can enlarge and come up out of it is it wearing a diaper or is its dangly bits hanging out oh no just picked her up and dropped her there you rolled a lot of sixes they're all sixes that's how she fell off the wall oh look how teeny i can finally see it it's so teeny i guess i'll fly up so i can see over the wall i have no idea what's going on wow can i hunter's mark the baby and then i'm going to try to shoot the baby with my blazing bowstring that would be a 30 and i'm going to make it a bramble shot dc of 17 yeah motherfucker okay well still 4d8 extra well 17 plus five is 22 plus eight is 30 plus two is 32 plus 1d6 lightning damage 35 plus 1d6 for hunter's mark is 40 oh wait plus the blazing bowstring another two fire damage i want to try to do the same thing again with a blazing bowstring again 28 okay bramble shot again because i get two motherfucker that's ten for my blazing bowstring oh jesus h macy 19 plus five is 24 plus eight is 32 36 oh my god 34 38 plus ten is 48 be free little angel baby we shall feast tonight that's so gross and i just shoot the baby i mean it was an evil baby right should we get out of here while she's doing that can i just look over the ground and see if there's any platinum deposits oh god get to the middle and get in the air no the carpet we just got to get the carpet i can go down and grab the carpet we don't have a few minutes you don't have to do that i can go get the carpet i'm right there are we bamfing out or are we flying up or we can plane shift but still really cool i hope that it slowly becomes a forest underground can you daylight or something like up and out dexterity saving throw that is so much better should you reroll 27 yeah i'll do the same thing 23 how much further do we have to go up you should heal yourself 60 feet in diameter no you can make a straight wall of 100 feet or 60 feet in diameter the little coffin okay oh my god the baby was created by the chat that was a really cool villain yeah was it evil or could we have saved it yeah go for keyleth to begin with try to kill her no you're my best friend i won't kill you tight
