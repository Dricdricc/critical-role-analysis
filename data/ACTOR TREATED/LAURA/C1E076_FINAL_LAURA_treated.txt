give her more time to get into the game i'm the top oh jesus oh my god okay number one i'm going to yell at the boys to run back into the mansion (nervous laughter) i hadn't thought this much yet because i didn't know i was going to be first i'm going to-- homina homina i'm going to hunter's mark the pit fiend and i have a question if i do the bramble shot does it do the damage straight up and then if they do the strength save then it doesn't-- okay so i'm going to tell trinket to move up next to him yeah and can i do bramble shot as one of my attacks and then do another regular attack is that the way it works it just says bramble shot okay i'm going to try to do the bramble shot on it okay that doesn't work a one two ones i don't know the dice jail was in the thing it's not here cool this is off to a really awesome start i'm going to just try to shoot him 25 does that hit him okay good 14 16 17 18 plus 2d6 because trinket's standing next to him 25 yes i want to back up into the alley can i hide behind that building right there in that little crevice okay how many feet away am i from them from trinket thank you my shitty turn good job great best place to be right now i was like (heavy breathing) you're too scary right now matt yeah don't intentionally look scary come on grog can you do that on a reaction why fuck do you have time to move trinket rolled 21 is that a bite is it a bite attack or claw attack do i get to choose it's a bite attack it's 13 to piercing damage to bear damage what it must be piercing no i meant in the mansion i said yes i meant in the mansion stupid yay oh okay i'm controlling pike right now okay so she's looking through the door what can she see okay okay she's going to step out of the door and she's going to cast spiritual weapon at fourth level if she makes it an anvil can she knock him down to the ground i want to make it barbed noose to go around his neck it's a yellow noose so it looks spiritual 23 26 points and is that all the bonus okay cool oh okay is beacon of hope-- oh it's third level shit balls oh okay oh hold on okay but nobody's hurt just yet spell bolsters allies with toughness and resolve oh did she what did she say oh good i want to do that radius blast but that's not a second level or lower oh god okay fine i'll do aid i guess why not okay that's going to be huge so the only people that are in range are trinket grog and me so grog pike and scanlan you don't need it though do you need it i'm going to go trinket-- okay trinket scanlan and pike and then pike's going to run back in the door okay oh okay plus five what is that 23 thank god okay good okay i've already tried the bramble shot it's gone now then i'm going to attack him a couple times that was a one and a 30 the jail is full i'm out of dice i have to go through my bag again 21 and then i'm going to move into the mansion no yes i'm going to move into the mansion no okay yeah i'm going to move into the mansion what he's whispering at me trinket licks grog ashley i'm texting you right now to tell you what you did you look so pretty just come back the other way come back toward us it's different he's big he could have a whip so many books tonight his boots i love these things right they're so fancy it's a concentration your little itty-bitty head even on a crit but it's at disadvantage because of hex oh no his figure just died if you fall unconscious try to fall unconscious the other direction okay he's still got movement left (gasps) ooh what a dick you want to put that in my jail poisonless god is she flying really far away can bigby pick you up yes we can but you can't move after you can only do your action oh wait don't forget ashley you have the spiritual weapon up as a bonus action i come out of the mansion i want to fly out of the mansion on my broom i don't know i fly up in the air and see-- my goal was just to come out spin around and attack but i don't see anything so i want to be about there okay i don't want to actually be that close to scanlan though for the actual-- yeah i want to shoot a couple of arrows at the pit fiend is he under cover can i be any closer so i wouldn't have that okay no that's what he said it's my full movement just to see him yeah i have four ones that are right now in jail second attack is a 29 great cool tight awesome 20 and then for trinket's action can he run up after grog on the roof can he try to scramble up he rolled really low what is that just strength so he rolled five wow i've got to get some more 20s out here i feel like you could make it to the top edge she probably can't do it again is that her name it's definitely gamora remember i'm not directly next to him that's why i said i wasn't sure just try it man just try it that is actually going to help you dude jesus we're all going to die that's going to be better for him though than getting these hits instead of shared great yay of course you better use cutting words on him for one of these things tight cool that is a four okay i've got to get my calculator out to find out if i'm about to die yeah no that one doesn't hit but the rest of them do okay yeah cool tight oh i thought that's what i just did he got four attacks right right that was already the 18 or was it oh jesus okay cool i'm unconscious no it's attached to me it is attached right next to pike does that mean that's an automatic death save failure though oh off of the stonework not off of my body i was like just like that huh don't forget scanlan you've been getting five extra hit points at the start of your turn oh it's just the hit point max okay yeah pike cast aid that was amazing hey thanks man now me and keyleth have the same amount of hit points can you try the sphere again no not even close but she is she's looking a little torn up yeah oh my god this is a serious thing though you're going to get healed just wave it around like woo okay i get up oh then i'm going to cast protection from poison on myself wow as my action well what are you going to do that cancels out the poison then i want to as my bonus action-- of course i did as my bonus action i'm going to take-- i don't know i have a bag of gems of my own i'm going to pull out from my thing and toss it at the efreet and say we're more than we look and we need your help hope that it bribes him persuasion persuasion 21 i'm going to move-- is it stupid to move into the mansion i'm going to move into the mansion trinket's going to run and stand next to pike to protect her oh no why is he looking at something because we need that dawnmartyr i mean it was so lovely the last time because it's that many dice yeah it didn't but this is different than the lava we've been in before loot crate he's really enjoying himself tpk tonight guys she's poisoned unconscious but if you move her you'll get an attack of opportunity on her god that heroes' feast man that would've been clutch no just roll a d20 we've got to heal her i do i have the poison spell-- okay i'm first out so yeah but i can run out no he can't move her he'll get an attack of opportunity on pike guess those jewels didn't do shit i mean the thing is-- i'll come out obviously i'm going to come out of the mansion and i'll immediately see pike i mean she's right under the demon i'm going to-- it's not going to work i'm going to try to distract him with trinket so i'm going to have trinket attack him as i run in and cast protection from poison on pike oh because yeah fuck i was in the mansion what's going on can i say that i can just see that pike's unconscious i rolled a oh just intelligence five so i can't even cast that on her right does lesser restoration heal at all i don't know that she's poisoned all right then i'm going to waste my turn completely and try to cast cure wounds on her because that's all i fucking-- i couldn't have run up and looked at her to know it was poison to see the black around her fucking-- cool 27 for the attack on trinket and then that is a 14 no that's a lie 11 if i move i'll get attacked i'm going to die good job good job he's already used his attack of opportunity no that was me he was doing that to no i'm not okay motherfuck i'm unconscious again by one point for the poison i've got resistance to poison now because i cast protection from poison on myself aw that's bullshit god damn it it's an eight because it's

break sure i'll look at my stuff i'm up to 100 the rope and i'm going to pass the boots to keyleth to look at ooh here you go i passed this to you so you could look at them this is the rope of entanglement the rope is 30 feet long and weighs three pounds if you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you see within 20 feet of you the target must succeed a dc of 15 dexterity or become restrained yes you can release a creature by a bonus action target restrained by the rope can use an action-- i'm trying to scan it and it's a bonus action does anybody want this rope you want the rope of entanglement did i say what i healed to i did right yeah oh we should talk to them they're not in chains though did the
