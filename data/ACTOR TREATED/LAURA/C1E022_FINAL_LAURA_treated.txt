have very skilled people branding us i'm sure perception let's use this one oh that was great oh even less it's a nine total oh there we go we must be branded in the dark tiberius oh no all right fine i'm behind him pardon me vanessa i thought you were just a band of hunters let's do it there's some weird stuff up high no like eyeballs is it like eyeballs is it moving oh okay it's that carving right there looks like an eye does anybody know anything about anything that looks like eyes can i try natural 20 does it look like anything we've seen before that was a really high squeak i look at grog like what i nod it just happened like that not going to lie it looks pretty cool can we insight check and see if she's telling the truth 24 has the glass totally faded a little warning next time vanessa maybe can she see through our eyes now she's not going to be happy with what she sees through scanlan's (laughter) yay i like the way you talk vanessa i respect that very noble i thought i caught all three i really tried how much is in that one all right we'll divide it evenly so we have a home here we have rooms here we don't have to pay for lodging we're staying here does it do dances i'm confused oh so you killed something that was human-sized then because we killed a dragon a big white dragon giant big giants yes we fought them both oh you did you did i've always liked your human form tiberius i thought it was very attractive almost died percy be honest oh you did we did not what was he like he i'm assuming it was a he keyleth lady keyleth well now that i know you're interested in some cleric i don't care well who wouldn't be keyleth you are gorgeous i'm bummed we had two ladies with us oh yeah in fact we should probably take the carpet back now that grog has the bag of holding all right go what is it yeah fly over the acid pit right and then you pulled up and you jumped-- but then you saved it and it was fine it looks a little less glowy though (shouting) you lost the carpet the carpet-- it's okay we'll just pool our funds together you guys didn't spend any money during your mission right we can pool our funds together and maybe find somebody you didn't spend any money you should have kissed her percy what should we do do we have enough time you didn't pick up blue shit it's a very good blessing wherever it lands i'm sure she had gloves on you had gloves on right well what should we do it's true we should probably go see your family before we go to kraghammer oh my gosh do we need potions just go and buy some potions wait does the slayer's take have a nice stock of potions oh yes funny thing we used them because it was a dragon do you have any more is zahra still in the slayer's take or has she left you guys really needed to meet her tiberius you would've liked her a lot she was red very powerful magic and eyes let's go buy some potions this guy no please yay what should we do you go find a blacksmith and we get some potions do you think maybe that you could maybe start out on a journey with us and then head back if you need to get back to the temple (gasps) i did not oh pike do you want to keep it at the temple just rub poo all over it ooh it's true you have some sort of thing where you do it with a spell where you can ask her to help us you should do it come on sarenrae oh look look at all these combined of the two oh

always if you buy a lot you can put them in your bag of holding that's what i do speaking of how's my supply in there is it pretty good still my arrows in the bag of holding while they're shopping i just want to drill keyleth a little more about her smooch that she got so wait he kissed you or you kissed him he kissed you a cleric kissed her do you know who his deity was maybe pike knows him and he kissed you wait a guy that's married to a god kissed you i shouldn't have even said anything was it good it was a good kiss can we hear this at all don't tell him all the numbers (laughter) you're

for grog well we'll say we're covered though yeah oh 400 darling remember who we are we gave you excellent business before i have no idea what i'm saying i think as a return customer you can offer us more of a deal than that come on natural 20 (shouting) of course half price is a very fair deal grog pay the man i was going to ride trinket so that there were three for them yeah me and pike will ride trinket tiberius i want it to be known that if you keep asking me for party funds i will not be so-- you're so charming today tiberius he did (laughter) i'm a little concerned tiberius i'm afraid that some creatures might be attracted to that light source it might actually be best to-- light the end of your staff ooh it would be smart we've got another day's travel tomorrow the hunter's mark that i cast on that merchant did he stay in town or is he out and about can i sense that six measly little hours of travel i can track it no i'm just seeing if i can track the dude i put a hunter's

you're brave very brave well we follow footsteps i can track footprints and i want to use primeval awareness can i use primeval awareness to see if there's any aberrations celestials elementals fiends undead any scary things dragons within six miles no a mile (quietly) there's no way to stealth here is there cover ourselves in ash or something to make us less visible is it possible to cover us in ash and try to make us less visible to the elementals i do have pass without a trace i can cast that on us 22 that's pretty 17 no don't oh no jeez louise oh no 18 it's addictive isn't it 16 how do you put yourself out you're on fire that's good trinket definitely saved that okay can i back away from him or am i going to get hit okay so i back up i'm going to back up against the wall so i can duck behind it if i need to and i call trinket with me for sure and then i am going to lightning arrow him i'm going to lightning arrow-- no jesus i hunter's mark him now he is surrounded by all of our friends balls i'm going to have to hunter's mark one of the little ones then and aim for one of them and i'm going to hail of thorns them the one closest to me that's a 25 all right why do i already forget what i'm doing normal attack okay 17 for the normal attack-- plus hunter's mark damage six for hunter's mark and then i get 3d10 for the hail of thorns okay that's a ten that's a ten this is a ten balls ten 12 13 13 and just one more regular attack 20 (cheering) oh that's it i know 14 for the second hit that's a lame critical nice the other wall all right i'm going to lightning arrow is that going to do anything to fire i'm going to lightning arrow the one that i've hunter's marked so that is 19 okay so do i do my regular attack on that as well or do i just do the damage from the lightning okay correct 4d8 this is so nerve-wracking (counting) 25 on the lightning arrow oh 14 oh i didn't realize you were there grog i'm sorry i couldn't see i didn't think that was ten feet i'm sorry oh good that's nothing two i do another attack out of the blood-seeking bow (singing) that's a 27 (laughter) ashley and yes 16 with blood-seeking he's a bleeding fireball waste i'm going to go

thorns him yes 15 yes 17 plus four so that's 21 plus 3d10 14 take two that one doesn't hit though 13 yay 16 20 he's like one of those creatures at a gas station (laughter) did you complete the mission i guess it's time to go nine we're a little further behind her (laughs) which one that's good that was better 18 pike what'd you roll one me and tiberius rolled ones oh that's it well it's easy to get
