like it kind of is yes-- erwen bring them down here it's an emergency as quickly as possible not yet darling we could use your help at this moment is he good a good person that's a weapon not at all we're grateful for your help not yet not yet four ancient dragons we're sorry unfortunately allura all of that is the reason for our current impasse we seem to have discovered something that could potentially reverse the situation but there's a great price to pay it could be a small price to pay we don't know if you wouldn't mind taking a look at this relic that we discovered i don't give it to her but i pull the tapestry off of the skull and show it to her okay he can grant a wish he says lying truth what do you think right no but i remember this we dealt with this with the demon that killed pike and it had to be so carefully worded a green a black a white they're definitely working together he said if we fight or flee we'll be denied the mercy he said our new purpose is to serve him it couldn't have been would a dragon seek vengeance against one of their brethren killed all right krieg was a dragon allura he attacked us it was right after we got to emon yeah oh i can sense them right yeah he's here do i sense any others they're gone for the time being we don't know anything everyone was dying around us we made it to the keep they want to be gods we can bring them here we will so we're definitely not going to wish on this skull then yeah fucking a what in the hell that's the first time we've ever ended on time oh jeez (cheering) everything it all would have gone to hell if-- there's got to be other ones it was really cool with green thanks for joining us you guys
