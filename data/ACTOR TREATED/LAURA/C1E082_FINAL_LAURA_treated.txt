thank you lootcrate we're glad to have you back so excited about it though just so excited oh my gosh okay okay okay i'll stop rolling for a second because we have these new things in the store and they're socks (gasping) yeah no these are for us can i just tell everybody how much i miss having you next to me boo i'm sad you're not over here oh god is it really that cold oh my gosh patrick dinner so we're just gonna choose an eighth-level for pike but it won't stick if she wants to not have that be it right oh so she doesn't have to choose one like a ranger oh that's great well never mind yeah power word kill green dragon for her eighth-level spell specifically no no they look so good on me have you noticed i know i know i mean like really good oh really strategically you can do more than me no no no i'll give them to you i'll give them to you it's the dragonkilling sword oh jeez who needs it can anybody take it should i do stealth cloak or should i do-- get me out of this bench situation hold on hold on i'll pass it over to you i'm not even going to read it keyleth okay wait the dwarven thrower this is the warhammer okay you gain a +3 attack bonus bonus to attack and damage rolls it has a thrown property normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet grog when you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon it deals an extra 1d8 damage or if the target is giant which a dragon is 2d8 damage oh 'is a giant' never mind immediately after the attack the weapon flies back to your hand kerrek are you secretly a dwarf oh my god let me find the fucking piece of paper jeez oh my gosh but i don't know what else pike has attuned on her (gasps) pass 'em over pike will wear them they don't need attune wow i'll write them down on her sheet okay here's a question can she have the boots on and then right before the battle put on the sprinter's boots and it's not like you can attune them and then take them off yeah they're pretty clutch especially after the last time but we're going stealthy probably before-- do you mind-- can i put 'em on for now since i gave him back his boots is that okay oh that doesn't sound as cool grog has every weapon ever what the fuck oh no did it turn you really really really stupid is it just because it's only meant for you oh shit a god no go talk to the raven queen or somebody sarenrae (gasps) maybe she can greater restoration if pike realizes what it is well i don't know if i know that anything's wrong with him grog do you have a headache do you have a headache well i can maybe do like a cure wounds or-- i don't think so but i can pray to sarenrae if it would help can i-- is there anything i have just insta-cute would i know what to do would she know what to do to try to help him at all okay i can try to do a-- i don't know what level greater restoration is are you sure grog okay let me know if you need anything though pike's gonna try to do greater restoration on grog it was worth a try though because that would've been helpful i didn't say it the last time but trinket's out of the necklace and he healed overnight 'cause he's low too it's a ring of invisibility just a legendary ring no that's really good that's a badass ring we should have a heroes' feast is there anybody that could do a heroes' feast okay okay okay pike can do another-- what level is that okay so we all have heroes' feast for pike oh that's not bad that's not bad that's a 15 added for everybody fear and poison advantage on wisdom and i attuned-- by the way my bracers of archery are attuned again yeah but what should you scry on can you scry on thordak's body or something 'cause she would have it right next to her oh jeez i'm so nervous he's eating wood again rocks and like dried poo (sings) allura kima got the feast too right is it the same difference that's true yeah yeah you know what when kima comes back i'm gonna give her the elven boots so she can be quiet if you don't want them i'll wear them i mean i like them a lot i'm just saying you're loud you seem different i cast pass without a trace on all of us before we go through the tree oh do you need me to cast another greater restoration for your-- okay he and scanlan both we want to keep quiet as we do it pew-pew-pew 24 for pike plus ten from pass without a trace 38 do i see any sign of tracks or anything dragon tracks dragging of giant carcasses or just y'know footprints advantage 'cause it's a dragon it is dragon-related natural 20 motherfucker i bet there's other tracks though that i totally missed 'cause i was looking for dragons can i look for anything other than dragons there won't be an advantage i really want that 20 but i don't get it this one is not as good is this an investigation perception (whispers) 11 okay but they were little mm-hm tread carefully just keep an eye out we're keeping eyes out for anything that looks different than normal jungle-ness 26 i wasn't just looking for traps i'm looking for anything that looks out of place in the forest 'cause i don't know what kind of traps necessarily would be set by something like this you know what i mean vax stop there's some weirdness on the ground i feel like it's something yeah don't you see it now that you're looking now that you're looking you can tell right is it quicksand maybe it's magic hey everyone let's just not step on this dark patch how about that 'cause i think it's like magic or something grog like bad magic the kind that would kill us all similar sort of thing i know right and then told you it was dangerous good job grog can we see the mountain that we're getting towards 30 is what i rolled but that's not as good as a natural 20 but 30 is still good whoa your perception bonus is higher than mine when did that happen like big holes does it look like it could be like things could come out of it do i need to roll since he's so good what if it's a one ooh no 24 damn it's probably too heavy for us to move but grog do you want to try well how do we get in if we don't open the entrance ooh dig i like that oh good call can you just put a hole in the middle like right in the center of the boulder on the ground we'd have to run around an entire mountain does it look like there could be any other entrances how long would it take if i flew around all right cool cool cool let's just shape the boulder (gasps) oh i'm gonna try to detect dragons what the fuck i sit down and go hmm they're here they're here oh god (hyperventilates) they're here she's still here and i think the eggs are okay 'cause i can still feel like there's dragons i think so i just did it within a mile so is that okay was that within a mile or did i need to spend longer oh so i am because it's woods right wooded i have to go take a poo i'm so nervous all right we're gonna go in let's go in i mean i don't know if we're gonna have to go through and it only lasts for a minute so i feel like we're gonna be in the caves longer than-- so we're still stealthing me grog i'm already seeing someone what little magic thing darling do i have to attune to that grog you're lying grog and then it gave you a headache grog (yells) grog this is awful no it's so bad for you (laughing) you motherfucker oh my god you see how hard this is when people want their boots back when people want their decks back you did find it grog you have to promise me you won't pull anything from it all you can do is hold onto it that's all you can do you can't look at anything you have to keep it in its little pouch so you know in guardians of the galaxy when he gives him that little ball at the end can i do that can i give him a pouch here's your cards back but don't look at them grog they're really dangerous all right yeah give me the necklace a little pouch that's the shape of the deck of cards it's maybe not that good of a pouch but it's grog okay well obviously but it's grog that's really bad he's gonna be able to tell nine oh my god i'm in so much trouble (laughter) i know he's so mad at me he's so mad it's really good that he's sitting over at the other table right now seriously though they're really really dangerous oh they're yours no i promise (nervous laughter) oh i just gave him back his cards is all what do you see keyleth how about i try-- oh what if we light an arrow can i do an oracle arrow through the hole i'm getting death looks natural 20 okay and nothing had walked it didn't look like there were any tracks it was just heavy dust i shimmy out it's just a tunnel yeah it's a long tunnel potentially raishan i think has rather good hearing if we make a lot of noise it might echo down but you do have siege gauntlets though what do you think should we burn another 4th or should we have grog punch the little hole a little bit what grog you wanna go punch some shit so it would just be another spell slot well grog has siege gauntlets so he could potentially do some damage to the rock but it would make noise doors why and then do what do it just get us in in theory yeah that's a good call because we have two of them now 12 did you want pike's trinket rolled a 19 i scootch can trinket get in or do i need to bamf him in the necklace and bamf him out okay that's what i do should we leave it open or should we take the rods we might need to get out in a hurry stealth oh this is investigation oh was that a stealth roll or an investigation roll that was investigation right dogshit 11 hey keyleth when you did the scrying thing how long did it take to get down in the tunnels was it a lot of tunnels before you got to the laboratory yeah it's less than a mile down i know okay should we all stealth i thought we had to reroll stealth 30 25 for pike he was here for a long time before-- he was here before he got the thing right yes is that the death ward it's a thing i talk to sarenrae and then she protects them for a little bit of time feels a little selfish but sure (laughter) i mean if you want me to do it sure why not i walk up to me i guess pike will cast death ward on vex feels a little weird not gonna lie yeah it's totally cool wait light your little dagger up this gnat this fucking gnat a little bit of light no no no hold your little dagger up to it i want to see what it is yeah careful maybe keep it out just keep an eye out it's hard to see down here no i just i mean for traps psh 'cause it's dark see if you'd pulled your dagger out it wouldn't be so bad if his dagger's out i'm gonna pull out the flying carpet (laughs) and i'm gonna walk over to-- i'm gonna give the-- hey grog so i have this flying carpet grog would you be able to use a flying carpet in battle to get up to a dragon it could be useful around us like how close around us can he sense that can we see anything on the walls that looks like a door or anything no no oh it could be watching through the skull you're brilliant kerr fuck okay i could do sacred flame on it and it would do radiant damage to it sure we should've come down in the tunnel wearing pantyhose on our heads so raishan wouldn't have known vex-agonal should i make a perception check too since i'm near it oh god that was almost a one but it's not it was a 15 oh god what there's ingredients i mean would it be helpful if everyone could see so light should we light it up does it look like-- when we entered the chamber does it look like a door would come down or something when it opened up into the chamber can i go look in the bowl the bowl in the middle of the room and just look and see if there's a residue of anything in it 26 no color change or anything on it well i don't actually touch it oh yeah i get out a lockpick and scrape it to see if i can-- they take up a lot of room though so scratch-scratch scrape-scrape yeah just to see what the residue is what color is it this is fucking blood maybe we should just bleed into this bowl and the door will open necromancy i tried to give this rug to someone else but grog didn't want to take it there's things going on in this room we've got dragon blood i'm gonna get out a vial of dragon blood (feedback sound) what is it i put the dragon blood away what should i do wait i've also got other kinds of blood let me see what kinds of blood i've got oh wait you know what what okay grog i mean sure yeah extinguish all the lights i wanna go and see if i can read it i think i need glasses it's blurry nah it's blurry that's actually a really good idea grog maybe we should light the brazier 22 oh no kerr if raishan didn't hear us before she potentially heard us now we need blood oh that dick book (laughs) i know who that is (laughter) opens the door dragon blood is so expensive i have basilisk blood black dragon blood and white dragon blood i know that's why the basilisk is better one basilisk vial fuck i pull out my opal dagger and i just cut my hand and drip it in creepy is the door opening it's like a kill-something sort of situation oh well shit (laughs) punch it okay pike immediately casts-- no no no not that she casts the other thing shouldn't she it's undead holy aura on all of us i wrote it all down hold on hold on it is within a 30-foot radius where everybody is it sheds a five-foot radius of light on everyone everybody gets advantage on saving throws enemies who are attacking have disadvantage on everyone fiends and undead who do melee attacks have to make a constitution save or be blinded oh my god [break] 16 for vex pike rolled a nine nine kerr i like it well don't write it off it was 15 that first one did its little jawbone go (chattering teeth) we're gonna die just from fucking-- well we didn't get a chance to move and everybody's got advantage on every single one of those rolls wait i gotta do them for pike fuck (sighs) do i have to roll for trinket too oh god okay pike saves two and fails two vex saves all god trinket only saves against one even with advantage trinket just constantly-- i didn't add anything oh well he had a plus two oh my lord i saved against all of them so i'm at 57 hit points now she failed two of them yeah so 88 oh thank god okay that's good that's good and then trinket only got one so he's in my necklace already animus that would've gotten pike up to one of-- she would've failed one of them so add 11 points back you would've saved on everything trinket still would've failed three just to put that out there he rolled so poorly even with the plus three trinket would not have gotten up to 13 on three of those oh poor trinket he's just-- oh i'm up okay i'm going to shoot them i'm going to shoot the one closer to you that definitely hits 16 damage plus three lightning damage and then fuck me i hunter's mark him i attack him again natural 20 (cheering) 20 plus eight lightning damage plus eight hunter's mark 'cause you double all your dice right so 28 plus eight lightning damage i move away from him into the-- oh on the opposite side of percy how is this ghost so strong good times guys check for traps check for traps yeah some sort of healing thing do we wanna-- okay if we all keep charging in that spell that we just did lasts for a minute thought raishan was around she was not so we've got less than a minute left on that level eight there you know what they did a good job of keeping us from all dying just then though natural 20 18 19 11 11 we're not gonna be able to get to her in a minute y'all if we take a rest we can rest up and heal okay yeah we use our hit dice 'cause we all got half of them back we can scry and see if raishan totally knows that we're here yeah that's the thing she's probably already bamfed out y'all oh yeah while we're resting i'm gonna detect dragons and see if she's still around same spot oh all right okay so what is that oh my god i rolled so good i went all the way back to my maximum so 115 is what i'm at now that was good oh i went up to 117 because i forgot i had the extra 15 pike's back at 115 wait scanlan gave us an extra nine hit points nine i'm higher than 117 then i'm one-whatever 126 sure so like a mansion we could have for two days just kidding oh you know what darling don't worry you can use the carpet so let's walk up there of course they do they really do okay then he healed himself while we were rested but he's in the necklace so that we can fly if we have to but they're only out for an hour dear of course the carpet can fit everybody grog and one person so i can get scanlan-- what's at the bottom of the stairs i mean can we drop people off and go back in let's shuttle-bus a safe landing is it safe to walk into the passageway pretty sure we should just use the brazier and light it i'm gonna grab scanlan on the broom you grab pike okay and then we'll take the gnomes and grog down and then come back up yeah i've got-- i want pike on my broom what was that what was that sam scanlan do you think it's broken now can we get other people from-- grog and allura can fit on the carpet right okay then oh god maybe could you take when you fly back up-- okay i go back up and get percy we have kerr and allura and keyleth left i grab percy on the broom and come down i feel like-- wait i pause before we go down the stairs 'cause i'm like there was this blue light that happened before and scanlan made it stop how do we not let that happen this time i thought you already went down on the carpet no okay you can carry kerrek you're so strong oh my god you've been lifting bro grog groggy can you come down and trinket's-- trinket's still in my necklace he's healing in the necklace i'm just gonna stay on the broom and just kind of very close to the ground but not touching the ground totally it's a leap of faith how long until your wings stop working zoinks i'm gonna go with him on my broom this is why i went on the broom i was gonna catch you jesus small heart attack over here i'm gonna turn around and go back to the-- that was weird it doesn't feel right percy be careful allura it felt like almost i was drunk as i was flying across that do you know-- so can i try flying out there knowing the gravity's shifted does it feel okay to fly out like that oh i didn't want to go all the way across i just wanted to test it so i could help bring other people across potentially grog did you see how i barrel-rolled on my broom yeah you should just do the same thing on the carpet i don't know can i get a better look can i look and see if i see it again is this related to dragons then that is a 21 let's just get across here shall we okay so i wanna get a good look at one of them as they go by i pick up pike and try to barrel roll across oh wait pike has a thing that she can help people with their-- damn it she's got a plus four on strength nine for me i'm tethered to the broom you got it you got it i love you don't hah don't hah the dm vine holds are my arms restrained acrobatics that's pike acrobatics 25 oh my god everything's fine you guys no i love you you're amazing can i just take out-- i just have a dagger can i pull out my dagger and try to jam it up into the zombie's-- under his chin oh it's all zombie drool i am really bad at regular attacks what do i add to this so 20 oh plus my dexterity i didn't roll a 20 i rolled-- eight what is pike doing i didn't even see that spell where's that spell so i would look down at pike you're amazing that was amazing this was a mistake how do we get down can i-- no i can't do that i'm like floating basically basically i'm like falling and just held onto a broom that's being held onto the wall i want to try to-- any zombies or undead that come near us i want to try to shoot them and at least ricochet oh my god yeah no that's the thing percy's on his way to save us so you guys just try to hold onto that carpet he does he could do it for himself that sucks 'cause scanlan could've taken kima that's you oh my god grog's still on the other side oh no this is perfect this is a really cool setup matt though it's really fucking badass the visual of it is amazing yeah for sure oh my god i'm so sorry i'm so sorry thanks for saving me darling you don't untie it all i like being attached to it i give kerr a big hug thank you saved the day well i could go over on the fucking broom again dear lord how about the bodies are they still flying thing is i can put grog in the necklace and bring him over 40 feet or is it 60 feet i feel like i could go back over i know i rolled a one though you guys it was real shit totally totally all right cool attach a rope to me i bamf trinket out so my necklace is empty and then i take off across the channel scanlan can get on the broom so i want to fly back over heart pounding this was terrifying i'm sorry buddy i wanna try to time it so i avoid as many as i can okay cool cool cool tight tight tight here we go here we go here we go natural 20 and that one's totally fine too that's a 29 oh hey guys hey grog do you trust me do you wanna get in this necklace and then scanlan and scanlan i want him to affix himself to this broom like really tie him on here i still tie some rope around i've got the rope of entanglement i can at least wrap us up the first one is-- i add my dexterity okay that's a 26 okay that's good that's good though this is good 27 i untie scanlan and pop grog out move forward i guess check for traps good i hope you rolled well 'cause i rolled a one again like into the fountain probably maybe leave it gross yeah i stand in between i'm scared of all my dice right now just all of them 17 i'm gonna try to focus on dragons again and see if i can figure out which direction they are it's up to you grog do i know which fork they're down 24 and there's a little bit of light coming from the end of it trap you wanna look for traps the dragons are still in there just ahead no let's all stay on one side it could just be like this could be a water canal that we're looking at right now it looks like they come back together this is just a giant separation thing oh but i have an actual coin to the right check the ceiling i look at the ceiling ash might be able to skype in too thanks for saving us kerr
