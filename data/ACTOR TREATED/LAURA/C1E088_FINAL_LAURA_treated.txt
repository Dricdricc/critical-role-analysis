right now so wait we're unboxing last month's box what did you do marisha you can put your soup in it did anybody show off the shirt yet that's pretty frickin' cool wait what size do i have hey who's got a small i got a large my favorite thing is the batman head thanks lootcrate what's up the dice are out of stock you guys you're always a little kooky marisha oh my god lego batman head's gonna be my dice jail tonight that's an important announcement a friendly prisoner we're friendly taking a prisoner nicely taking a prisoner kraken plural i feel like we should-- we should have a heroes' feast before tomorrow i have no idea what a kraken does or-- how large are these lodestones that we're looking for great lots and lots of snorkels keyleth i know you have the ability to turn us into different things is it possible to turn us into water elementals it's not a thing narwhals merfolk what if we want to be a mermaid though okay sweet and a seashell bra ooh i like it oh trinket okay yeah but a midnight feast like-- no 'cause that would waste a spell on the day makes sense i don't know how my bow's going to work underwater practice for an hour have a midnight feast right so fight first and then snack no no no no no yes we're doing that but we're leaving in the morning yeah can we still breathe on land yeah ooh sleep in a fishbowl can we see under the water how's our perc-- visibility what about percy with his glasses i mean could we do some sort of goggle things so we can see better so that we could see underwater oh i don't know if there's time for all of that it'd be great though tary you're really good at crafting right all right could you make something like that in like an hour yeah i'm going to try to shoot an arrow and see what happens does it-- it doesn't seem like it pierces any so what would that be uh-huh oh no thank you ryan so for a longbow ooh let's be sharks or we could be merpeople how do i find out how far a longbow can shoot okay done okay yeah but oh wait you can shoot into water he's a real bear tary he's a real bear hm he's still formulating it through a portal into-- a little yellow fish a little yellow fish that's very friendly i have a little poison bolt do you want one i've just been holding onto it if you have a crossbow 50000 gold hm i'll take it i was just gonna gift it to you but i'll take the gold i do still want an alter self coin see that's pretty great that's cool yeah all of this conversation has been happening underwater we're surfacing and talking and going back under are they yeah but what if the kraken sees it yeah let me make sure pass without a trace is not concentration we have to be animals that can grab things run distract him only attack if truly necessary it's true half of us are animals half of us are riders the thing is the kraken might be able to swallow you whole grog i don't know how big they are no but they've got-- don't they have beaks like a squid yeah yeah i'm out no we were treading water oh no is there some sort of alter self spell that-- yeah no yeah you're right aw i like how seaworld is was what was our line of tactless is there an alter self sort of spell that could make you be able to speak underwater is there anything that you can do that allows for speech what about merpeople how do they talk to each other are there really merpeople there are merpeople it's water breathing it's the spell water breathing what if we use some sort of-- -- cap right on grog's jug and it just makes air (laughs) okay okay okay whales and riders i guess i'll be a whale or trinket could be a whale i will ride trinket can't we have two people on one whale i feel like whales are very large but like ice cream and donuts like a midnight snack kind of like waffles and-- yes mm-hm mm-hm yay lovely all right oh maybe we could do it in the morning we'll find out if this is going to make us be able to fucking talk underwater-- (gasps) talk grog that's awesome what a waste of (sings) fucking time yeah it does oh so we have to be super quiet (gasps) this is awesome what a fucking idiot we don't have giant domes on our heads oh oh yeah that's smart oh alter self maybe you should be a whale is there any burlap around what if i stitch up the front i just would hate for it to open up i'm just gonna-- do you mind if i just-- i'm really good at sewing yeah i stitch up the front it'll be like a choir robe for you yeah that was smart fun fun fun i start working on the robe really ugly stitches you're welcome darling (gasps) (all laugh) oh shit oh yeah-- yeah i'm gonna brush trinket you need it you're dirty (all laugh) yeah just gross i want to spend the morning before anyone else gets up standing on the edge of the water and like letting my toes sink deeper and deeper as the waves-- that's fucking sick ah nice yeah trinket's gonna be a whale if he hits zero okay i have a question if he hits zero hit points-- does he go into the-- would revert and then-- okay it would have to be 150 points of damage thereabouts 160 i mean i can just use water breathing and cast pass without a trace on us that's the only thing is i can't do that if i have alter self if what okay oh good all right you're a rider i mean i can swim what if you give me the coin-- -- and if things get hairy then i use it and then we drop pass without a trace i'm not gonna be an animal we're fine yeah so i'll get a coin i'll cast it go in if things get bad i'll use the coin the old alaskan pipeline that's true yeah you can call us by anything we'll both respond i follow suit (gasps) that's awesome i think so this is where we're gonna check out the lodestones before we go through the door no no no wait how long does it last no 'cause we can do it underwater can't we well let's wait until we're going into the water plane before we turn into fucking whales he's coming tary shouldn't we leave him just lots of water what if he gets rusty it might be smart to not have him join us just leave him behind what does their hair look like i just stare at her are they all the same color every lodestone looks the same not translucent at all not-- okay i do have locate object nice yes locate object is concentration and so is pass without a trace it's within 1000 feet yes yes are we ready have you seen a kraken and how big are we talking big enough to swallow him all right let's run right kraken is it beautiful aw it's so cool i'm going to take a moment to use primal awareness and see-- is there a way to sense krakens or anything i don't know do i aberrations celestials dragons elementals fey fiends and undead and krakens krakens-- yes elementals aberrations-- -- and fiends oh i have to choose one what do you think what do you think aberrations or-- what do you think a kraken is what would a kraken be aberration no all right then i'm going to try for elementals they're like everywhere i have a feeling light will attract all sorts of creatures down here hm hm what about those kind of fish that have the-- -- things that dangle in front of their faces he's covered i'm going to use a locate object spell yes no no no it finds similar objects awesome there is a lodestone within a thousand feet that direction oh that is smart she can cast it on an object and leave it behind you could-- -- cast it on the tip of an arrow and i can shoot it at least 150 feet let's try to move stealthily for a little while or should i just drop it and cast pass without a trace right now oh good call all right (with hesitation) okay (all laugh) i hadn't imagined him in but-- yeah he's going to turn into an animal so-- let's bring trinket out fuck it yeah so he can fucking swim well what if-- okay it's fun buddy oh god no no no i'm gonna cast i'm gonna-- fuck i'm gonna cast speak with animals on him trinket oh she's casting pass without a trace i'm casting speak with animals trinket everything's fine you're just underwater it is we're going to be swimming for a while you're gonna make me cry dear we're going to be swimming for a little while all right do you feel okay with this he can breathe just breathe in just like land only not yeah we're good are you all right all right just giving you a heads up you may be turned into a whale in a little bit you'll be really really big and you'll be able to swim a lot better all right just remember to follow my lead and i'm gonna hang onto you when you are a whale all right okay i love you i trust you too i love you i'm proud of you i love him so much i love him shut up it's fun see it's fun but paddle quietly dear we're trying to be stealthy okay i love him aw okay okay okay oh with pass without a trace right i'm sorry i'm sorry i don't know what to add for trinket's stealth is that just his dex maybe okay so 29 for me and 30 for trinket 18 let me make sure i'm right on mine yes i am oh concentration it's not no okay mm-hm can i look around does it seem like it's right there okay 25 can i move some of the sand out of the way on the ground and see if i see anything ten yeah bust out that compass i'm gonna wander to the other side of the wall and see if it's on the other side to the other side of the wall yeah ah that makes sense do i see it now (high-pitched) nine we're digging softly we're trying not to do that shh shh shh we move over there to start digging i think we found one do you think they'll know if we grab it do you think it's going to attract anything grog can you swim over here we lift it and put it in the bag of holding hey one down do i sense another one with my locate object spell all right all right shall we hide yeah curve around so we can hide from the big figure up top woo yeah plus ten 39 going around we're trying to keep as you know stealthy as possible do we sense any kind of movement around us or anything twenty two 21 no we got goggles i mean do they can we start looking for the lodestone 18 can i use the compass well can i just use the compass i wanna take it and bring it down to the ground and like-- like a metal detector oh god oh god i feel like something's bad man why is it so tense that's good 26 for trinket and the compass yes it is again fuck we go around the fucking rock i don't know grog so you don't have to cast again yes 19 19 oh no shh put that dice away put that dice away right now tary you're fucking us tary did i find it while it was happening 19 jeez maybe we can shoot daylight directly into his eyeball in his eyes maybe he's not used to bright light or directly at him 19 the groggy-poo whoa he's really pretty in that light though we would've been a bunch of whales slamming into shit i'm going-- oh no oh god (laughs) i meant petco use luck tary (laughs) 18 damage i already forgot what i rolled 'cause everybody's talking numbers 14 you got it oh shit he doesn't make it marisha and the alter self coin does that take an action or is that-- fuck okay then i'm going to start with pulling out the arrow and doing what keyleth and i talked about hey i'm pulling out my arrow and i'm gonna shoot it-- as close as i can to the kraken's head and just like past him i want it to go by the eyeball i mean if i can get it in its head-- if i can hit it in its head that's cool but-- what is happening to your watch his watch is telling him he's working out oh i know it said-- okay come on laura and come on come on 26 (high-pitched) okay well all right (deep voice) 12 plus (normal voice) one lightning damage this is not a sneak attack and i obviously can't have done hunter's mark i want it to be by its eye well now there's shadows ooh that'd be great oh yeah i can't do a spell for my second i can't do alter self on my second i was just checking okay do i still get disadvantage if i attack it again okay i'm gonna attack it again okay i'm gonna attack it again what's 15 plus seven 22 12 plus just one damn lightning damage (southern accent) one damn lightning damage there right 'cause lightning-- it just did lightning obviously it's immune to lightning right and i'm gonna use my motion to back the fuck off and try to get behind that rock outcropping laser pointer okay yeah sure just on the other side of it okay cool okay yeah can he back up behind that pillar yeah oh did i get a bonus action i guess i could've-- can i hide for my bonus action as rogue yeah i'll do that you're next to tary though you can put it in his i didn't roll after i said i hid okay oh that's good that's good 35 aw he saw me 35 is not good enough to hide from him oh sorry i'm sorry that's-- oh that's right you hate fish oh god oh god oh god this is bad aw who magic is hard guys does he gots two eyes or just the one eyes got it wait which direction yeah no your wisdom oh no he's so strong oh no it's the dread emperor all over again i get 19 points natural 20 just kidding he gets it too (all laugh) (gasp) oh yeah he can grapple like all of us (southern accent) he's got enough of those tentacles (all laugh) me (southern accent) it's showing oh no (still southern) no that's mom fucking a i gotta use the alter self so i can actually do something though i won't be able to get to anybody i'm just going to waste a turn oh am i still doing it (extra posh) i'm using alter self okay i'm gonna swim behind the rock-- god damn it light-- laser no the other rock sorry yeah but on the other side of it and i'm gonna-- and i'm gonna use my bonus action to hide again oh no no no i used alter self bonus action to hide and you cast a spell so we can't use pass without a trace anymore so that's 24 yeah you did all of us wiggling oh my god how do you break free of being restrained are you punching it that's good that's good that's good maybe we can just rip open its guts and then leave it he's grappled ooh no that's something (gasps) oh you can keep up vampiric touch if you want i'm on the other side of the rock but i can hear you (gasps) oh my god can you get the water away from the kraken and maybe it'll just be on like landlocked right right (gasps) (laughs) that was like such a grandma reaction ooh you no right ah i bet it looks really cool with the daylight passing through it though huh awesome i can't i have to keep my feet on the ground that's me oh creepy really creepy i am going to-- matt's like -- swim up and over towards my brother towards where she was pointing the lodestone that's with the altered self okay i'm gonna have trinket-- wow okay awesome i'm gonna have trinket for my bonus action swim up on top of the kraken's back and try to claw through because he saw grog get swallowed he's just claws like thinking he's going to get to the belly he's going to attack him with a claw attack damn it that was a good one oh 25 for creamer did you say creamer oh okay five plus eight is 13 and i guess i still have an action because i can't get close enough to search for the lodestone so i'm gonna try the thing that i saw very noisy keyleth try earlier which is to shoot out grasping vine and try to break someone free with it grasping vine-- oh oh okay then i'm gonna cast conjure animals and i'm gonna try to cast-- that's third level i get summoned fey creatures so what's a fey creature that swims underwater to what oh cr i have my card wait-- what is a rating one is that super lame rating two is still super lame two yes i'm sorry i'm sorry matthew i'm sorry it can be-- you know what it can be an animal i'm conjuring an animal i can conjure an animal i'm gonna conjure a shark i've seen a shark why does it have to be a fey creature i'm conjuring an animal it's considered fey it says 'each beast is considered fey' you can summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts okay i cast a shark right around the kraken i want it swimming around the kraken to distract it and it's gonna attack him roll what 11 it's more for distraction purpose anyway it will be if it uses up a fucking tentacle hey that hits how close am i how close am i how close am i halved because of his armor everybody's grappled it's just a tentacle it's not-- what if you turned us into animals now will that break the grapple krakens suck oh god oh my god is it like being in lava gulp oh no what about my shark does it get an attack of opportunity i get advantage right on it okay 16 plus six is 22 oh 14 for trinket do i roll for the damage of the shark 13 (gasps) you can do something from the inside aw yeah this one's crazy ew like if you swallow cod liver oil you vomit yeah oh no at least it's still retrievable can you use a bonus to help anyone nine tentacles or it might just swallow all of us and then we just planeshift from the inside of the kraken and everything's okey-dokey but we all have to be holding hands no that's what he just said there's no water yeah he's going to shoot out some watery lodestones plus bless oh oh my gosh if you knock yourself unconscious with your own fireball wow no it could kill the jug that's good oh shit mother fuck slowest math 16 for me and 14 for trinket so-- he is ten points fuck okay i'm gonna keep moving towards the lodestone and my brother so can i use my-- can i get it out of the water and put in my bag of colding i have a bag of colding yeah okay-- we're all going to die but we have three lodestones doing it and i guess for-- god for my bonus action can i-- i don't know what to do i'm going to have-- while i'm thinking about this i'm going to have the shark attack him the shark's gonna bite the tentacle that's holding onto-- who's that right in front of him percy no he's going to swim towards percy and bite the tentacle to help free percy and he gets advantage 15 is that enough okay i look at my brother and say can you get out of this okay i swim back and use my bonus action to try to hide yeah towards the rock towards the-- yeah well i try to hide-- yeah can i sit on the ground i wanna sit on the ground and wrap my cloak around me and make myself look like a rock hey oh really well then if i can't hide from him can i use my bonus action to do something else then i'm going to have trinket attack him he'll attack the tentacle that's holding tary oh trinket-- trinket's grappled trinket's going to attack the tentacle that's holding him oh two 19s and that's a critical for trinket that's ten did he get out damn it is the kraken an animal was trinket within range for a (chomps) only if you're grappled yeah 29 29 but you're grappled you want some more d4s okay yeah eyeball death yeah we're just trying to get away whoa yeah oh what a clutch fucking vestige would have been great if scanlan were here just to like dominate creature don't get swallowed get us out of here and we slip out of its grasp (laughs) he loves looking up animals i don't wanna be a giant constrictor snake we wanna be teeny ones or little ones so make us killer whales yeah that what are you reading what are you reading marisha it still can hold us then i think snake is probably better to wiggle out that's the thing he's going to be able to hold whales maybe i don't know i don't know i don't know it's your aramente and we all just book it we're all just gonna bamf back to-- but at least hey we're ungrappled oh what are we doing ah yeah as an eel i'm gonna swim around the big brown rock away from the kraken towards the door yes i feel like i'm just leaving everybody behind-- oh and trinket's gonna do the same thing can he use his double action to do the same thing just kidding but i am gonna make my shark attack him the shark's gonna just swim up in his face swim up in his eyeball and just be like wah look at me i'm-- i'm a shark 21 yes okay that's a bite attack that is-- okay wait-- oh that's more than that anyway 12 aw ooh yeah i wink at him with my eel eye well you're an eel but wait no it's-- is it an eel's-- -- attributes plus you're an eel it's a 10 ac fuck yeah 'cause it was 10 hit-- yeah he's got like no hit points as an eel eight eight marisha and shit and then i went then percy went fuck me and percy ooh that's good it's okay it's okay yeah how many tentacles are we-- oh right is beast shape concentration oh that's a natural 20 yes you do you have a coin but that's good to know still yeah wow that's a major healing spell you've attacked him with acid since ah jeez don't kill it don't kill it yes we do all the lodestones no not anymore no not anymore they got-- oh no oh yeah and tary why are you trying to yank him towards you you are directly under the kraken oh yeah that could be smart since-- so you don't go unconscious again you're right under the kraken just wake her up adrenaline 23 but only ten for trinket all right does he-- i mean 18 is what i rolled i don't know what i add for it i mean do i see any of this happening as i'm just fucking swimming away i guess my-- fuck i'm gonna swim up so i can see down over the rock okay i'm gonna try to shoot an arrow into the tentacle holding my brother oh disadvantage right same thing 25 15 16 17 17 damage with four lightning which i'm sure does nothing sweet and then i'm gonna-- do i have any movement to swim back down and hide as my bonus oh miss it 22 and then i'm gonna have my shark attack him yeah plus nine-- 17 plus nine is 26 good shark good shark good shark with a bite attack-- sweet 14 i'm just using trinket's stats 'cause that's what i had in front of me is that terrible i'm sorry okay oh and trinket's gonna swim towards the door it's your ac it's just your ac fuck he has a lot of tentacles and you're out one's out one's out it already happened no no no he doesn't swallow you but grappled i'm gonna throw up what if you-- is this the ultimate fight of like-- yes ugh (gasps) you're unconscious inside of him natural 20 wow fuck we shouldn't have attacked it so much he's a defeatist if i've ever seen it yeah yes yes you used beast form on that you used beast form to turn into a whale yeah you're pointing at the tv screen yeah yeah yeah 23 well vax is inside of the kraken so you're at zero you're at zero i rolled a 20 yeah okay and trinket rolled a-- like a four cool i saw-- and i saw vax get swallowed did i see that happen i-- fuckin' a i swim up and i swim-- god damn it i'm gonna try to shoot thorns i guess hail of thorns maybe actually i'm gonna try-- yeah i'm gonna try-- -- to shoot hail of thorns at-- directly at his mouth i don't know try to get him to like do something to let go spit it up it's the stupidest plan i know but i'm not thinking clearly my brother's got fucking swallowed i'm gonna do it at-- oh everything within five feet and keyleth is in five feet okay is anything within five feet okay then i'm gonna-- i'm gonna cast it at fourth level yeah oh no i did grasping vine did i no i didn't no i did conjure animals so fourth level 23 yeah 11 plus three lightning and then-- how many 4d10 18 yeah i guess i'm gonna try to shoot at his eye 29 16 plus four lightning nothing and i'm gonna-- this is so stupid i'm gonna swim back down and try to hide i've got nothing yes i did i'm gonna stand right there and say fuck you let go of my brother oh yeah this is gonna be-- (make impact noises) good then you can get vax out (laughs) the kraken (groans) so that's 48 hit points healed yeah i want it to go and try and attack the tentacle that is holding tary 21 no 22 14 trinket runs-- -- oh yeah and trinket ran towards the door i don't know about that it might keep them from getting digested (gasps) well still better than nothing oh my god maybe (groans) would it be like a patch healing spell 19 for me and-- fail like five six he's unconscious so he's bamfed to my necklace is he within a hundred feet oh my god oh my god i'm gonna swim to her and try to cast cure wounds good i'm casting it at third level so that's 3d8 that's cocked that sucks seven sorry seven save my brother (garbled) save my brother i'm gonna try to hide i'm gonna just swim away from-- i'm just gonna try to swim towards the fucking door but try to keep my distance from kraken while i'm doing it oh shark is going to attack one of the last tentacles if it can get to it 28 12 the shark has been pretty great and it's so late and we're just into the wee hours of the morning watching ourselves die but he only has two tentacles left the shark's been hurting it and keyleth just is barely-- that's great (sings) my honest husband don't (groans) you better fucking heal him no he's unconscious grog can't do anything (gasps) look at that look at that poison bolt (gasps) you're tugging-- dexterity nobody else is grappled right now hashtag so not blessed unconscious tary-- motherfuck you took me (gasps) oh fuck oh he's-- laura & he does have the third lodestone oh that was a great way to ensure that you got out of here tary (all laugh) what just happened he said nitwit throw the nitwit through the door can he throw tary through or is that an additional action it's a red bull lair actions oh my god oh my god i think it's going to try to swallow him right through the door vomits him right through the door oh my god that was so much worse than i ever thought it would be i feel like i'm going to throw up everybody but vax yeah i was watching him take it down and i was like oh my god one more hit and grog's unconscious you would have been swallowed too oh i feel so sick so that's good
