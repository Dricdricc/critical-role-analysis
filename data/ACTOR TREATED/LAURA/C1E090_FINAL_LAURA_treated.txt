not necessary you should do it grog i'm scouring my notes for where i wrote their salaries down it was but i've got my spiral here that's my memory 100 gold a month for each of the guards and then what was the extra and then we always gave jarett a bonus because he was captain yeah i remember do you know where the rest of the crew is shayne right well we're glad to have you back do any of us remember why nitebe went to wildmount oh no we did oh no we killed our guard maybe he just took our money and ran i doubt it though maybe yeah just scry while we're eating breakfast what do you see has he posted anything on facebook lately what do your scrying eyes see keyleth oh no this is actually very terrible that's terrible well at least we've avenged him in a way yeah i'll get right on that yeah yeah yeah anywho we're down a few servants we should probably get some more guards hey shayne do you have anyone you'd recommend that's all right find a few more a lot of keeps have been ruined guards might be looking for work actually good leading good leading keyleth this is shitty can i roll for insight and make sure that she's trustworthy i feel like she's trustworthy but-- i rolled poorly for my insight-- 13 all right i like it make sure they're trustworthy if we're not going to be around and i hand her 500 gold for herself and for kendrick and the three that you hire she's cool to drop off the evil book and do a little research on the nine fucking hells she's got to get crowned even larger antlers so you just hold it like a giant mantle (gasps) you could turn into doors a mimic yeah we have i think it's a no okay what are we fucking doing what are we doing oh grand poobah i'm afraid you have to wear something quite formal i really thought we were going to get him to bathe this time (laughs) just a belt a really glorious belt over the dwarven belt gross seriously though what are we doing maybe your dad will have information on the nine hells wait i do have a question actually if you complete it do they want you to stay or you stay and lead your people it's just like getting married keyleth it's all the planning that just freaks you out that's all theoretical obviously i do (laughs) keyleth make a decision leader you're going to be a leader just make a choice i'm looking forward to buying a dress either way and see how you feel good plan so wait (valley girl voice) would the shops here be better to buy a dress than the shops in westruun that's what i mean but it's beautiful you know what vasselheim will actually know a little bit about orcus and i bet the nine hells as well being the god hub we should go to vasselheim decision's fucking made let's go let's go yeah yeah are they regular or are they greater oh all right that's pretty cool arcane magic make him look like he's just a big dude wearing a robe with a hood over his head let's just put a robe over him let him give it a go i want to help him because i'm a rogue too what if we just put a stealth cloak over him or something yeah then paint his-- yeah i do i start taking robes out grog's upstairs fine i take all of the robes off do whatever you want why are we doing this just wear a robe you need money to go buy a stupid mask for a stupid robot no it's not no it isn't i have passed out money lately before i think fine how about everybody gets a thousand gold yeah everybody take a thousand gold except for you (all laugh) i'm going go into town and buy some plates for laina did he roll well it's just a bunch of pieces of hair how long does goop last will doty just always have hair now gross but it's going to be covered by a mask wow (laughs) (laughs) nice (laughs) are you sure oh my god (all cheer) chuck e cheese brianfostersmellslikecabbage (all laugh) what have you been doing up there it's dootie did you get glue all over my robe that i put on him oh motherfucker 24 oh no it's not ruined that was my stealth robe (laughs nervously) yes that's the only robe i fucking had (shouts) i didn't know you were going to glue it to him (shouts) i know motherfucker let's go to vasselheim ew i like it not the chest but in the bag of holding wrapped in cloth waypoint well we should go-- yes the library we delivered the horn of orcus to the platinum dragon yes so we should probably go talk to them as well and also to talk to them about orcus since that's-- yeah sure oh grog could also go learn about the nine hells yeah tary-- tary tary-- i pull tary aside if you're going to go shopping with grog you need to know-- don't look at him he is terrible with money tary he's terrible with money i mean like he will offer them-- stop it he will offer them double what they ask for i'm just saying-- (deadpan) i'm so happy for you just keep an eye on him all right (sighs) (strained) fabulous (laughs) no you were going to the platinum sanctuary we're going to the library we are we have come to discuss the (whispers) horn of orcus that we delivered here a while ago mm-hm what i don't remember oh right as he does that i look to vax and go hey i have an idea so the book we have right what if instead of leaving it here we left it at the raven queen's sanctuary don't you think they would keep it more safe because she hates undead right this is like her nemesis right oh really do you want to do that all right cool let's forget i mentioned anything all right i just lean against trinket do we know what we're going to say or hold it right do something with it okay it's history though true didn't mean to summon you scalebearer i know your time is precious we however came across in fighting the chroma conclave and defeating them this book which references opash's search into necromancy necromancy necromancy necrome-- yes necrom√© researchers it's an evil tome (whispers) all of it can i insight check him (groans) it's not terrible but it ain't good 14 necromancy yes right well that's good okay yes be warned the book tried to claim me i know yeah can i ask you how much do you know of orcus i don't know much of anything and it's important that we learn he only has two horns right four and you don't have another one down in that vault if you hear any word of that horn will you send word to us of course thank you so much for your time do you know much about the nine hells i fear we have to travel there there is a rakshasa after my brother and our cleric friend pike and unfortunately i fear he will return if we don't snuff him out at the source do you know what sort of people might survive there all right all right so we'll go to the cobalt reserve fabulous thank you (whistles) mm-hm all right what about all right do you think if you go to the raven queen's temple she'll claim you for her own right now what am i seeing (laughs) what the fuck is this when did it happen what do you mean you don't know did it happen after you died what the fuck we have to get you to a cleric that's not normal are you sure it's related to her well they're holding the horn of orcus playing devil's advocate then let's go to the raven queen's temple do you want to go now let's go would i have known anything about what that thing was like trauma it doesn't look like raishan's wait i thought we had the book it's glued under the cloak there was no box it was a book wrapped in cloth in the bag of holding i mean if he really was a demon why would he need to do research genealogy of the nine hells oh you mean like senokir you said he was a demon and he was actually a devil the succubus what about the succubus we did kill a succubus ooh to a lesser like they get turned into something smaller i thought you took the book no you have the book i thought you were lying to the guy you actually have the book right i didn't take the book i thought you took the book are you fucking serious let's go to the library we're heading to the library similar to james spader i think you have to use the second roll yes do you guys have the book what the fuck what did you find all right okay we can read that wonderful the city of dis okay we have grog's bag of holding the same one we've always had hey is there somewhere we could buy a fucking bag of holding is there somewhere i could find before things close just to see oh balls that's terrible i rolled 13 fuck fuck fine it's fine keyleth how about we go see your dad they definitely are interested in it at the platinum sanctuary they were very interested in researching it which i don't think is a bad thing they're good people and learning about history is a good way to keep yourself from repeating it however you do serve the raven queen who i know wants nothing to do with the undead and if it means destroying this book then do what needs to be done it was my idea go fuck yourself dresses oh everything's fucking closed are there dress shops open at all we just want pretty dresses oh oh oh 25 ah everything's better keyleth what's good for your ashari people something covered in grass maybe turf astro-turf lots of pink bows maybe for me right and we could be like-- help us make us pretty and very expensive looking it's my first time getting to dress up as royalty this is terrible give her something flowy in all the colors can it be in all the colors okay she's had a few i think that's acceptable mm-hm i can't believe these dresses are so much cheaper than a healing potion ridiculous (laughs) wait we're picking them up in the morning keyleth you're not even wearing it yet oh we haven't heard from them in a long time grog did you buy potions i want to say the name of it marisha and the other bar (mystical voice) we're in the siren's succor (mystical voice) meet us soon did you buy potions beer (laughs) some wine ugh (laughs) i'm staring at the door waiting for grog and taryon grog i forgot how weird doty looks did you get it did you finally get it it's been all night he killed them did he really kill them dear diary i have an itty bitty metal penis (all laugh) as he's doing this i pull out some lipstick and i start drawing lipstick on his face to try to turn him boy to girl (laughs) grog (nervous sound) what 20 this is what happens when pike isn't around did anyone see you do it doty did anyone see you do that to the guards maybe you shouldn't bring him into cities maybe that should just be a rule doty doesn't come into cities well yeah trinket is well-behaved doty kills people yeah can i try can i try too oh (laughs) did you buy potions for me oh (sighs) do we need to go find these dead guys except for mistakes don't kill people in cities don't kill people don't kill people grog did you-- you didn't kill anyone did you i don't believe him can i roll an insight check oh no oh no laura and i believe him i believe him so good 11 oh my god grog ugh we're never going to be able to come back to vasselheim i don't believe you yeah i don't believe you you killed them oh i rolled gil too i got it i got you covered 24 you fucking dick no but seriously you still attacked the guards right that's still really bad at least doty was in disguise no one will recognize him just take the disguise off him now take the disguise off of him a robit it's necromancy yes (gasps) what we thought we had a book but we didn't did you i say we get doty's disguise off of him i say we go to sleep then we get up in the morning and we pick up our pretty dresses and we go get you crowned so we can wear our pretty dresses what about the cloak no why were they going to arrest you it's not illegal we totally should how about you go
