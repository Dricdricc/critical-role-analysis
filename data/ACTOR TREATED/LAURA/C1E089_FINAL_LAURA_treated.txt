it's amazing we thought it was for all of us but then we realized it was just for matt and marisha phenomenal no did you plan that that you were almost vomiting today and you vomited and ruined our lives you there it is (laughs) distappeared i flip him over and look at him vax vax wake up is there a cleric on the island i start dragging his body how big is that that's tight where are we going oh no i'm holding onto her right please are there any clerics here he's-- he's dead no no he won't claim him what can we do how do we even know they're alive please hurry how do we know if it worked how much time does-- how long is too long i start brushing his hair off of his face there are other options i don't care what he looks like i just want him back don't let anything harm him (tearfully) it's vax i know nothing i look for any sort of message from the raven queen on his armor 20 what's five plus seven no 22 22 can i pull it out what is it i'm going to open it my-- fuck oh no no i just put it back in the armor there's nothing can we start he's been here for a while i'm sorry to bring you into this so quickly pike i'll mark it off i'll do it i kneel down next to him and i take the feathers from behind my ear and i start braiding them into his hair and i say you were always better at this than i was but you gave me these feathers in one of my darkest hours to remind me of the beauty in the world so i'm giving them to you now because you take the beauty with you i've done this so many times we've brought so many of us back but this feels different right i feel as if i'm not speaking to vax i feel as though i'm speaking directly to her no no he's at her side but it's being filtered through the raven queen so these are my words to her i'm here today because of a bargain my brother made with you so i know you like to make deals as much as i do he traded his life he became your champion and you spared mine and what a striking champion he is long dark hair and a strong lithe figure soaring over the land in raven feathers and a dark vestige he set pyres in your honor sent soul after soul to you it would be a shame to give that up especially now and i remember the book that i read especially now as orcus builds his forces against you the demon prince of the undead seeks to claim your throne you know this as well as i we just recently killed one of his loyal servants in the underdark before my brother ever came into your service imagine what he could do now so this is the deal i make with you you send him back allow my brother to come home and we will seek out orcus i will track him down i will hunt him in whatever pit he resides and we will destroy your enemy once and for all what say you 25 oh oh god oh god he always does that vesrah you're alive (laughs) hey that queen she's pretty scary looking huh (laughs) hey pike pike's here (shaky laughter) she fixed you hey welcome to the club yeah all that's left now is keyleth oh do you need to rest do you need to go lay down well yes but-- oh i pull mine out as well how many people lose their lives on their aramente how many people complete it how many people did she have with her what are you talking about 'who is that' what are you talking about that is taryon i didn't think it was published yet you forgot to mention the part where you vomited and blew our cover thank you um pike and they're speaking this whole time in gnome oh until later okay okay uh-huh so we'll heal up now can we be on the beach i like it like a hair bit or like a hair bit that goes like this ooh yeah i like it (laughs) all of i've only got two of 'em and they're both in his hair what for like you do oh it's wonderful it's a little morbid and wonderful at the same time that's so wonderful keyleth that's so thoughtful what a bummer oh i feel like somebody that just got party invitations it's like oh i ran out you could always get it back from him if he decides to leave our presence it could be safe if he's--- just let him know it's to hold it he doesn't know our names trinket goes up and pees on doty's leg oh trinket that's not a tree that's a robot yeah it'll come off don't worry (laughs) don't worry percy he makes it-- (gasps) yeeeah i love this game how do you even have strength for this right now (laughs) in what oh right i thought you meant in size yes i have (laughs) we've always known that yes we do i don't know if that's going to happen dear i sort of made a promise to your queen could you hear it on the other side when we were trying to bring you back i kind of sort of-- and i come down off of his feet (laughs) and stand up-- i kind of sort of promised her we would hunt down orcus i mean i was trying to get you back i know that is really hard and we probably are going to have a very hard time finding orcus and killing him since he's like you know a god i think-- hey you're here now (snaps fingers) i'm sorry yeah right stupid decisions to bring the people you love back to your side very stupid stupid to be a champion stupid to kill orcus stupid all around no no no i just kind of said we'd go and do it so it could be you know ah i just said we would do it (laughs) yeah yeah i have a feeling she pulls our fate strings anyway she'll make sure we get there mine's connected to yours wherever you go i go unless it's you know-- (laughs) aw i'm glad you're back (claps) grog that was amazing i write ten on a sheet of paper and hold it up (all laugh) i have it in my bag i know it will fall off of your form ooh seashell bras with salt crusted on it what about
