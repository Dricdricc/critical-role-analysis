well now you have it i thought you said you already wore a necklace are we heading out immediately i don't know why i asked for potions when we had four fucking potions lionel the crutch sorry i was looking at necklaces not misty step wind walk you have to ask him all of them i'm surprised it's not working honestly that's the most chill i've ever seen no they are wait but how many people can you do because we also have doty yeah trinket's in the necklace oh shit taryon and scanlan let's go do we have to join hands for this we should probably concentrate for just a minute i'm gonna turn back just so i can shout out we should all follow-- you know how to get there right lionel bob up and down if it's a yes okay we're going to follow you all right and when it's ready to land then just hover down and we'll all follow your lead that's totally normal we all do it all right survival check we might get lost don't get us lost plant la-la-la i'm picturing beautiful bob ross mountains just lightly touch i go down and do it too 'cause he did it is this where it is it looks like it was caved in actually don't be so hard on yourself lionel are there ducks here are there any kind of tracks around or footfalls that look like it was recent and it's a mountain i can roll that one again yeah that's way better 27 i think i've picked something up should we follow it now or should we-- -- camp out and do it in the morning wait you can call them to you that's a power that's amazing could you call multiple to you and they pick you up and fly you through the air no i can tell his body language is super chill for a duck i'm just gonna stealthily start following the path around 29 can i search for one do i get advantage because it's a mountain fucking balls perception no i want perception 11 weird i wonder if it's an illusion can i put my hand on the rocks and see if there's an illusion what-what i feel like vex is really good at finding illusions oh shit okay well can i put the front of my face through the wall and see what i see well it's too late constitution saving throw that was almost so good but then it wasn't ten i'm a rogue now you guys (coughing) jenga not full jenga don't go through the wall can i heal pike there's a thing in there there's a face and it sucks your life out i found a door though guys don't i'm not even going to tell you where the door is i'm not going to tell him where the door is nobody touch the rocks there's a bad door just listen for a moment bad door right in front of me fake bad door if you go through it there is a very bad face that sucks your life out yeah yeah i'm going to take my oracle arrow and crouch down that's why i was going to crouch down and shoot the arrow super low to the ground well when i peeked my head in before i got my life sucked out i didn't see anything in front of me did i give me shit and then take off on your own you should mark off one of your lucks because you already used it for the day maybe you should try sticking your face against some of the sheer rock face you know what i should probably find out and i shoot the oracle arrow no i don't want to go crazy far i want to get in a little bit further to see if i can find any more traps and see how that face works 65 percent of my strength is used i think there's a fire further in the face is in there not to my arrow but it was there on the wall no no no grog don't we should dispel it or something yeah see if you can dispel the magic yeah but we shouldn't go in the night we need to rest we would have to camp inside the cave-in oh scanlan we've been so long without you i forgot we had it we're going to go back to the cave-in oh wait wait wait i did have a question i feel like it might be smart to get my arrow out of there in case anybody comes out and sees an arrow but i don't know how to do that is there an unseen servant or something no scanlan that's not what i meant no i don't want you to go in it fucking sucks your life out do i know how many feet in it went you got it oh that's a good question fenthras exalted what like 120 feet is it that or is it more that's really far no but how would you do it how would you do it i saw eyes the sockets glowed green and then i got hit right but the eyes glowed what if it can reach you that far in you're too big do either of you have dust of tracelessness oh it's dusty was it dusty in there thank you no i see tracks coming in and out of this place i know there's people that use this maybe we should go back into the other side then unless somebody can just fucking dispel that face and then we can just go in this way in the mansion you've already gone back did it hit you that fast it didn't hit you let's maybe move away from the entrance i peek my head in does the flickering light in the distance seem brighter it's too many choices too many dice fucking shit motherfuck wait wait it's a mountain no i'm looking in the fucking tunnel 31 we could i think i might have used up its only charge potentially or it's recharging does the glyph of warding alert you once it's gone off oh right the guy that was stealing all that gold okay good then we are probably safe going in i'm going to cast pass without a trace on us i'm going to see how many people i can cast it on every creature i choose within 30 feet of me so sweet it's everybody is percy back yet percy hold on to my waist dear and add ten to it because of pass without a trace 25 it's because percy's holding on to my waist actually doty has the best night vision he's got complete darkvision oh we all have darkvision we didn't take a nap maybe in a little bit me and percy that's true what did he roll for stealth yes it's cocaine if we camp then they won't find us they can't see the door percy spread your legs i let her crawl through us (sings) you're the best around okay keep going forward oh shit you were right by fucking other faces when you popped in before roll super good shh 22 scanlan maybe now is the time for that door yeah how near do the voices sound let's backtrack to the caved-in tunnel no let's backtrack to the caved-in tunnel and set up the door i thought we were not going to fight but it's up to everybody else i'm going to stand at the entrance of the tunnel and guard scanlan (singing) scanlan open the door you guys want to camp let's go like a glyph not that hot feel like coming to the campsite maybe we can't find the card keep an eye hop in the mansion before we go in will you throw down the dust of tracelessness grog well that was fun last longer that's it that's all they make is salad but you run the place is the picture still up that pike commissioned is tary-- does he have his own room as well yeah tary scanlan scanlan tary scanlan you can add a room at a thought he can have your room i guess so should we open it and see what color that is just one because it's all black walnut don't fuck up the wrinkles they look so good in the light yeah because you have a backlight and a halo around you because of the shield now your hair is extra fluffy because you did it they know how to make chicken though i know the servants know how to make chicken fabulous oh shit did we say that we have to buy chalices before we have any more fucking feasts shit balls we're out of chalices we've got to remember we've got to do it yes potentially or they could have given up what if we just peek out the door and see yeah i'm going to peek out the door very stealthily open the door a little bit and see yeah i'm going to stay inside the door but just look outside the door ah fuck shut it i think it might keep getting worse i'm not sure yeah some of them are a lot meaner we could turn some undead yes i want that i do want it yes bring it this fucking sucks as we're walking towards the rooms can i pull pike aside for a second how are you well i think it's reasonable to be angry it's a different side of you well your emotions are justified but you found it in your heart to forgive your family and they did terrible things to you maybe it's harder with people that are closer they cut deeper have you talked to sarenrae about it you don't want to do it yet he's still charming i don't know what tomorrow will bring probably a battle of some sort which is usually life-endangering just ask yourself if you would want to die without saying how you feel you'd know a few minutes later when we tried to bring you back i just spit on you i'm sorry it's hard well you know if you feel like staying up and wandering around and talking to some people-- we haven't been here in a while ooh but like an acai bowl is there granola it's going to catch up when you burp really good but what if i want it to catch when i burp oh shit i take off running what does the mace of disruption do to undead see this is why you take the time at the beginning to organize for divine strike quick use your spells destroy undead nice yay do you roll for all 15 don't confuse him it's a lot to keep track of hey guys we have these amazing art prints by david mack i nudge scanlan i sh-- i'm going to hold it all right i'll shoot one of the skeletons oh i just decided maybe i shouldn't hit them though because i rolled a one (laughter) oh no it's the chicken-scanlan incident all over again you know what i'm going to leave it it's for them i got a blood blister on my arm don't say that oh no that was a lot of skeletons that you killed pike with that spell that was really good he can read it depends on if there are long words do you know what he sang whoa grog i didn't hear it maybe you should sing it and let him know what it was a free massage i cast pass without a trace on everybody well i don't want to close the door to the mansion but turn out the lights in the mansion so you can't see (whispering) wait i shoot-- shit we sneak out we sneak out and shoot them from behind if you feel like it you can go this is a team yeah 27 plus ten no pants and boots and pants i bramble shot one of them i'll go for the further one should i roll two for attack ooh so oh i'm an assassin too so i get an automatic sweet ooh so i double all my dice oh shit 66 on the first hit for the arrow yeah oh wait i didn't do my sneak attack damage (cackling) 76 for the first hit we check it for traps okay he did we need to have tary identify it can we drag the box back to the mansion can we hide the bodies yeah and dust of tracelessness to hide where they were dragged yeah grog don't touch any of it until we get tary to look at it do you have a picture i spilled coffee on my paper and it looks like david mack watercolor we go back to tary tary we're in the mansion tary tary i've seen you naked what are you doing in here why didn't you come down with us you can go you can go you've got 30 feet of jack whoa go us shut up is it attunable do you have to attune it we're in the room we're in the room tary i'm your best friend oh wait is it a necklace tary you've never been quite so obsessed with your dick before you're doing it how are you you've been hiding a lot oh no you're not there you're my best guy i mean you were poorer without knowing us you just didn't realize it this mansion disappears in 24 hours so you can't just hide in here i feel like percy would like this a lot we found something that you might enjoy i put this on we should go attack things and head deeper in see where the people have been still have pass without a trace going natural 20 natural 20 but he's in a mansion he'll just pop out and then he'll be sitting in a tunnel by himself sorry matt what do we do he's going to kill him he's going to kill one of them what should we do searching keeping an eye out for any other people as well god damn it oh no 16 well if anything's going to bring more skeletons it's that should you heal us before we pop into anything more can you heal us that was a lot maybe we'll have to fight things outside of the ziggurat what the fuck but it's a doorway i shot an arrow through it moving forward keeping an eye out for those-- no she wanted to summon an elemental i pop trinket out can i hear the noise of the ziggurat coming from either side more what about wind or anything do we see faces on either side 28 maybe i feel like there's traps i'll go right do they see us do they only see that side do they see us come around the other side of the pillar they see all of us how far away is the ziggurat it's such a big map wait we didn't do this last time did we wait so it's reversed so when we tell you which direction we want to go matt it's from your perspective can i see whose voice that was that was crazy 27 familiar no how dun dun dun i know 14 so pissed it's a giant-- working your way back up anti-magic dome are you both wise roll your advantage you get advantage try it maybe you'll roll a natural 20 it's hard to keep track of three characters has anybody tried shooting anything through the orb okay well i'm going to try hunter's marking delilah i don't okay i'm going to try to shoot an arrow then at where i remember her being because it's red natural 20 oh what a waste because it was red motherfuck okay then i'm going to hunter's mark that big guy and i'm going to shoot him with a flaming bowstring are you fucking kidding me yeah when it didn't fucking count you motherfuck don't rub it in my face when i just rolled a one no he has to wait because he's going to get hit he's going to get bludgeoned i am going to move back into the little corner that's next to me yeah and trinket will follow me in there shorthalt who i suck tonight i can't help it oh i can add inspiration okay no that's not going to save me ten trinket no she's at the bottom don't jinx this what works on feeblemind tiberius had it one time how did we heal him it's cultists and delilah left okay if it's doable to pass through a magic barrier is it an action to drop anti-gravity they'll all get bludgeoning damage from the fall i'm not on the ceiling oh no it's a whole rainbow oh my god you're going to another plane okay i'm going to take aim at the other cultist i'm going to hunter's mark them that's the old one with the staff but they're holding a staff i'm going to bramble shot that one no yeah i'm going to bramble shot the one that i haven't seen his face yet that was a 33 okay (counting) nobody's standing next to him right (counting) 27 so 27 damage and then dc of 17 strength dc of 17 but he's holding the staff still okay i'm going to hit him again i can't fucking add 22 i know do i get sneak attack because he's restrained that was the shittiest additional four oh no i don't have any idea what i rolled before that oh god i'm so sorry (counting) this is so much better than the first roll 23 and then 33 i'm going to get on my broom no but i'm going to be ready to i hunter's marked him too didn't i i didn't add my hunter's mark on either of those attacks an additional seven for hunter's mark i assume we didn't hear that terrible pun from inside the orb of death she can attack oh she can't attack what if you die she's hiding in the ball we can't get to her the orb they went into the orb that's how they got over here yay the most lackluster how do you want to do this (laughing) that is the stupidest death no she turned it into that she succeeded on the previous one this a pathway into some other world now we can't do anything in here okay let's take the cadaver outside we fucking killed her how did we kill her before how did she die like she fully fucking died holy shit what if it's not really her well she can greater restoration her as soon as we walk outside i mean you could try stop what well we can't go through now oh fuck but we're not even healed they just went through we're going to go through and just die immediately it was just a doorway that's what i saw through the other one can we back out and see how far the range goes is it the same distance as our ziggurat yeah one of the bodies just full on her lips eww fucking gross i help trinket helps too because he's stronger or the blade the sphere there's only two more questions left not ripley delilah it's stupid or do they have plans to attack through the orbs or how many orbs are there on this plane yeah are there plans to come through the orbs nah he wouldn't know that great is that the longest we've ever gone yeah for sure thank you marvel puzzle quest
