that's awesome yeah it smells really bad you guys that's a good announcement oh no percy was upset perhaps we should check on them or a ribbon she wore a ribbon we have to go see uriel yeah it really does yeah from this angle you look amazing grog oh so it looks normal again i like it yeah beautiful don't touch it i'm going to go upstairs and see if our guest lillith is all right i don't want to disturb percy just yet lillith are you with percy lillith i peek my head in damn it go and read it she's so cute i tell everyone that she's gone gone understandable percy has good reason to hate-smelt he seems rather disturbed that the briarwoods got away i was a little bit preoccupied by watching him shoot a servant boy over and over and over again what did he say what did he say it's a really good line did you ask him about it at all what do you think his pepperbox is-- what he did pee the bed when he was a kid well maybe we keep an eye on percy percy's not the one who killed a poor old woman though tiberius destroyed her i shot her i shot her in the back let's be honest i didn't chainsaw her but i did shoot her in the back as she was running away i was aiming for her shoulder if it makes any difference she had a wand just beds and temples (laughs) what time is it do we need to be getting to uriel we should probably be getting to the palace oh good you're back yes tiberius the point of this is you killed an old woman last night very brutally please maybe don't do that again yes you were maybe not on sleeping people anymore people who are actually attacking us we're all on the up and up now right she was attacking us it was an accident uriel's waiting for us keyleth it wasn't intentional and everybody knows that actually before we head towards uriel we probably should-- do we have any sort of proof that the briarwoods actually did horrible things and it wasn't us attacking them all right cool just making sure that we had something seeker asum allura didn't see the fight plus they were the briarwoods' guards anyway he went away with the briarwoods i'm going to assume trinket's still here though 13 here's the thing percy doesn't like them because they killed his family they took over his home after killing his family he got away he knows they're scary we're trying to protect you we tried to get your attention i called for you immediately as soon as we knew there was danger also while you are inquiring about him you might inquire about seeker asum he was mind-controlled last night up until last night he was himself trust us that now he is not how long will your investigations take are we allowed to leave the city in that time weirdo (laughter) darling seriously you have a two in persuasion oh wow what happened what does that mean does that mean uriel's under their control i don't understand do you think he was faking that he was healed and maybe he wasn't is he bleeding out what if he's dead we're so screwed yeah the guy that percy shot the hand off of oh shit i hope everything's okay can you go get her and bring her to the keep i need to find out if this boy is all right saving the day again but she was attacking us they're going to do it (laughs) we should have rolled low just tell us you're doing it we won't resist it what the shit doesn't even trust us to tell the truth no because it'll disappear the minute we kill her or something they're vampires i don't know what they do thank you allura we say as we're walking back to the keep well we're allowed to leave town liam and yeah no he said we're allowed to leave we just can't look like we're fleeing so we tell them where we're going they can even fucking follow us i don't care especially that beardy side grog endless errands i walk with you well they're right at our fucking keep it's not like we're all headed in the same direction anyway i have one grog doesn't have one he has notes on who is on duty hello who are you can i insight check to see if these guys are legit it could be lord and lady briarwood for all i know hi when did these birds start showing up keep your money and how long of a ride is it is it walking distance oh so real close you can't actually it's worth nothing you will we are in danger of being ostracized we should really be nice to everybody right now the klauses we are here to help people we're here to help i head straight to the jail we know where a hole in one is grog went through it he's hanging i go and get the keys and i take him down from the manacles does he look like he's been bitten at all can i look at his neck 20 hey there welcome back you are being held at the moment for your own safety yeah well you were captured we're pretty sure the briarwoods are going to be pissed as hell that you let the carriage get hit we're just trying to protect you really keyleth do you need to step outside right now everyone is at risk the briarwoods are bad people you can attest to this yes yes can you tell us everything you know about them you did we want to know if the briarwoods-- pretty much they're vampires right i mean they're vampires i cast cure wounds on him i know cure wounds bitches level up 11 do i add anything to that 14 if we keep you here protected would you be willing to tell your story to someone else the emperor the guards here an army that could go and fight the briarwoods it's true far more comfortable a little less safe i'm going to put it out there i think it is and we will bring a bed down to you make sure you're comfortable i don't want you sleeping on the floor that's terrible all right are you all right give him time so yeah i'm going to lock it i'm just going to lock your door to make sure you're safe make sure nobody can get in the briarwoods destroyed his family as well and a chamber pot because come on so that percy can't get anything through there i do want to go check out that bird creature at the farmhouse tonight get the crossbow guy that we like so much the guy that's the captain of the guards no the guy he's awesome and he's an archer as well jarett that's it i'm staying down in the prison just for the time being i don't want to leave him alone with percy oh pathetic i'm still in the prison everybody else is out of the prison i like wall of thorns oh that's not the whole place though yeah they can see through illusions pretty darn well our very capable guards maybe restoration can you cast little restoration she said she hated you how did that feel oh that's it what if i leave trinket in the prison with jarett yeah fire fire elemental ooh water elemental (gasps) tiberius remember that you-- i know you do i have a diamond of awesome and a regular diamond as well i give her a diamond this is a regular diamond the awesome diamond is special no don't do that diamonds are really expensive any diamonds i think we should use the ruby because i have an eye for these things what he's going to go down in the prison with jarett i knock on percy's door and say percy trinket's out here if you need anything you just come out and you pet him welcome aren't you sober yet can one of us polymorph into a giant cow we hear you have a keen eye kyle do i see any cowbells on the ground hey there's a cowbell scanlan i like it should one of us maybe not be a cow no keyleth is definitely a cow no i mean-- i didn't-- we didn't mean like that you're very lovely i'm going to lay in wait with an arrow all the rest of you can be cows how you going to put it i'm just going to put it around your neck right now that way we can ambush the bird you are so cute scanlan let's go talk to some cows i want to walk over to the cows with you the one that's got horns i'm just going to notch a bow to my bow just to keep a lookout to the sky yeah remember dork dork the ox (whistles) i'm letting you guys fucking know there's a thing in the sky i hunter's mark it as soon as it is i thought we were just-- i immediately-- oh god i shoot it but i was notched already 21 i'm going to shoot it through the blazing bowstring 16 (counts quietly) 26 and then i'm going to shoot it again that one definitely hits 26 26 again is your enhance ability still active from before i've got hunter's mark on it so i can track it come on scanlan wait was seeming a concentration did it drop are we no longer cows oh my god you're not a cow anymore can i fly down towards it is it flying away from us now should we still track it it's still nighttime right we're all following it is the mountain range really far away i can track it of course yes i'm going to cast pass without a trace on all of us no it just makes us stealth easier no it's not concentration it's an action oh wait (laughs) i don't know if i can tell where does it say it oh never mind it's a concentration forget it i don't know how these things work yet okay he came to a stop a little bit ahead of us can we all try to stealth in all right well i'm going to try to stealth mountains are my favored terrain oh i'll still fly 28 did we just find like a mama bird and baby birds what are we going to do me go in there's a giant fucking nest here i get close to it as close as i feel safe getting to it this is so stupid do i get an advantage because we're in a mountain environment at all yes 12 but she's killing the farmers' stuff maybe and her babies what where are you who are you who said that ditto i try to perceive where it's coming from is it in front of us to the side of us is it coming from where the bird seems to be you still look like a cow eagle a cow in a cloak that's 31 no it's just barkskin it's just defense can i come forward all right what about vasselheim not in the city but outside of it there's plentiful forests tons of giant creatures it could feed on there's so many monsters out there they don't hunt them all because there's too many 21 then as a natural 20 you know that's good for you that's the best place you can go you can see the wisdom in my persuasion i go and put my hand on her back and cast cure wounds because i got that spell now yo don't bring up contracts keyleth maybe just don't even bring it up it's just across the water you could fly no problem over it we could fly back pretty fast couldn't we yeah we can just fly back can i see if there's any feathers dropped from the giant bird creature can i grab a few of them can i have a feather that he dropped because they're beautiful you have to admit they're beautiful thank you i pay them for their two cows being nice man how much are cows usually worth yes i have i purchased dork the ox shit how much do your cows normally cost darling that's way more than i expected 40 gold each to make up for the loss of your cows along with some other food right look at us not fighting things that's really beautiful i'm glad we didn't fight it
