i am very talented yes i am have you seen my work remember well also i've written a lot of letters they're really good well thank you i did have really good tutors when i was growing up ooh i'll use something like esquire or something in there that sounds very-- secrets i'm really good at keeping secrets okay (gasps) i know about that that's where fjord wants to go are we writing this for fjord okay solstryce yes i know where it is soltryce academy to whom it may concern wait do i say that no last name given leonard hyphen hyphen what leonard hyphen leonard got it got it (gasps) vast sums of money right the funds okay oh shit now i've got to write it again because you said it wrong hold on no mrs lavorre esquire the legal practice of nott nott and brave law firm okay nott and brave law firm okay and then what now do you have a seal or something because it would be sealed really fancy you know what i have my mom's lavender oil hold on things that are from really fancy places they always have-- so i'm going to get it on my fingers and handle the paper so the paper smells like it was handled by someone rich yes we'll do something like that i use another piece of paper because i don't have any kind of tissue paper okay wait we need a really fancy seal we need wax i bet caleb has wax okay do you know where any candles are let's take a candle from around the room and then we'll stamp it with a ring one of my rings okay which one is the flattest this one it's got a rose on it well i have a forgery kit how do i know if i'm proficient hold on i think i am because of my background yes no yes i don't know hold on i'm opening my-- yeah proficiencies and languages forgery kit why intelligence can it be the wisdom okay plus what my proficiency that's 12 plus three is 15 a really good forgery did you see that it was really trying dexterity check ten this is pretty shitty we need actual sealing wax i peel it up yeah i'll go to the store and buy some sealing wax two silver for this wax you better be really grateful okay now i can send letters to my mom with a really cool seal boop you're welcome who astrid (gasps) that's the name he said to me when we were dancing did you know yes we were dancing we were waltzing it was really lovely he was very drunk and then he said something about astrid was it his girlfriend he's very handsome especially when he shaves you can see the little butt chin he has it's really nice me too i run in you shouldn't call them arcane copies they have their own personalities and their own self you should appreciate them well all right but i think each and every one of you is unique in your own way and you should really appreciate it i go back to rearranging the shelf bye prime he does have a point there it's like they were specially made for you beau you have to buy them i think you should charge her more i feel like you're a very specialized sort of buyer is all oh you should give her a deal i'm sorry i got confused caleb save 300 gold because we need diamonds i remember you asking him for incense before from him i think maybe i can do that for you i pick up something and throw it across the room i also might want to buy weapons if you have a weapon that is also really cool and stuff are we going to get it fixed or can i still stab people with the broken part what does it do well i mean i'll look at it i don't know it's pretty broken-looking oh my goodness that's a very exciting thing oh that's expensive seems like something you could hold that's pretty cool question is there anywhere else around town i could get an enchanted weapon of some sort but everybody else has really cool weapons and i just have an axe how much would that cost something that makes me really cool that would make me hit really hard and probably open wounds that don't close ever and maybe poison people and also turn them into candy yeah you know really bad wounds also it really hurts a lot and it makes people turn pink and also it makes people like start dancing and stuff seems like a really reasonable price for all those things what about just one of those enchantments what about it just makes people start dancing they go yeah and they can't stop it's like it would be really hard for them to stop oh my god that would be so cool i feel like that would be harder maybe i could decorate it to look like candy i don't have that much either wait do i no i don't how much ooh that sounds way better whoa okay i'll do that here take this one it's an axe it's a handaxe ooh yes it can yep sweet okay i mean we should get that right longswords aren't simple weapons so i can't yeah i'll help you get the cloak ooh yeah and you would give us a deal if we bought a whole bunch of stuff sure all of us save 20 gold still pretty good 25 gold i'm going halvsies on the cloak with him yes and then another two because i'm going in halvsies on the cloak with the dust of deliciousness is that one use or multiple uses that's still pretty good (whispers) okay i want some of that too really oh will you take five gold off of the dust because you like me that means he likes me 20 (whispers) i won't cool okay hi are you grace deuce we need to buy some diamonds now we need to find some diamonds whoa both of us or just me advantage (singing) investigation 11 sorry let's go in there no we're seeing if it's open are you suvo i am jester secrets whoa yes how many do you have that sounds like a lot of diamonds are they big diamonds or little diamonds i don't know oh caleb should be here right now we can tell they're really diamonds well just making sure she's not ripping us off okay ooh that's good perception 20 i've seen a lot of diamonds in my day there's lots of diamonds right in here yeah so we'll buy all but you know these two little ones because those probably add up to about 150 okay i'll do 300 and you do 300 okie dokie oh is there anything else in here because this seems like a really cool shop is there anything else that i want does she just have the sack the one bag in the shop (laughing) that's so cool wow okay you know what we could do get the garlic sprinkle the dust of deliciousness on the garlic and feed it to the vampyr would i know this stuff a natural one yeah this is true and we sit there while she pulls out the entire bag how much is the healing potion oh that's expensive wow i would take it but i don't have enough gold okay oh i did that wrong it was because i was listening to what he was saying i was distracted there we go okay how much for the mask i know ah ooh three gold no er seven deal okay i think so thank you suvos i'm done with my shopping all of my money is gone everybody be a monk yes really peaceful actually four days later you see you know it too that means you looked at me because you knew he left while we were shopping no i am not done well because i want to make the traveler like me again because obviously he doesn't and that's why he didn't come save me i'm going to use these two weeks to scout out all of the temples to the other gods and really see the guard schedules and the priest schedules and try to sneak in i'll probably enlist the help of nott here because you're good at sneaking this is true before we do this this will be extra helpful for you just check it out well imagine it's a lot bigger than that it does say rouge doesn't it put it on i bet it changes size when you put it on because most magical things do and then we're going to go and try to sneak in and really fuck up-- how much time do we have what you owe us nothing you have nothing i already fucked with that one seems like there's a lot of guards there ooh yeah let's do that one because it's close to the bathhouse well that's just fitting isn't it no i'm going to do the platinum dragon because it's next to the bathhouse no what does it look like we're checking out during the day you know like we're visitors (snoring) (laughter) how often does he come back and then he gives his sermon during the next day and the next day we scout it out a couple days in a row to really get the feel for the guards with advantage because nott's helping me oh jesus h macy nine nein wow i'm going to take some of the firecrackers we got from hupperdook and i want to set them off during his sermon and then i want to-- but i'm going to invoke duplicity so it looks like i'm actually still there listening to the sermon then while that's happening-- but i'm also disguise self so i also want to look like somebody else while it's happening so nobody can trace it back to me this is really good stuff and then i want to run over to-- is there a big statue of the platinum dragon this is a really bad time to do this because there's lots of people around can i do it at night is there less people at night would i have learned at least that much okay i come back a second time after setting up the fireworks now the next time-- we have to do it right this time i'm coming prepared with my paints and a mustache my anarchist's cookbook a couple brochures for the traveler and i steal cad's straw hat that he bought-- sorry-- and yeah we're going to make the platinum dragon look like a really cool farmer yeah that's what i do is it stupid or something no if somebody comes in you need to distract them okay don't let anybody see me because this might take a while you're the distraction i also invoke duplicity to where it looks like i'm still there on the outside and i can also be hanging out with you so you don't look like a random person the old woman that was in the other yeah ooh no you know what i should disguise myself as the sermon guy yeah get them out yeah distract them and make them go away you know what you should say say that the sermon guy whoever i am tell them i need some quiet time in the temple natural 20 natural 20 oh you really should've taken that potion beforehand yeah that one i come up from behind no i step up from behind nott thank you dear my assistant did as i asked i really needed some quiet time alone in the temple tonight i just hired her 16 i need some quiet time no no (coughs) no scoot on out scoot it that went really well right okay you stand right here okay i'm going to invoke duplicity i'm going to make it look like he's kneeling down in the doorway praying then i'm going to run up and i want to start painting up the platinum dragon yeah i climb on up i start painting that's a 22 ooh you know what i could just knock this down that could be really good too i start climbing up and i want to paint it rainbow colors i feel like that would be a really nice addition for the platinum dragon with a mustache and a straw hat i drop down and run 21 i'm still the dragon (shrieks) and i run was there an exit looking for an exit 23 wait say that again dark this is like a choose your own adventure how many are there okay i'm hiding in the room 19 oh no oh no dodge it okay and when they
