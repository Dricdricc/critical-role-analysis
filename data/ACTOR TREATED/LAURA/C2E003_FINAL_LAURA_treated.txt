the joy of sitting next to you you know the kind of superstitious gamer that thinks that the color and style of dice actually makes any difference at all the sort of weirdo who believes some dice are

oh yours rolled a one too (laughter) oh no oh no you have three initiative what's your initiative no i'm four one plus three yeah they're just sitting there they are fast moving zombies we should probably kill the zombies because anybody that gets bitten by a zombie turns into another zombie now i just want to do hamilton with all our character voices oh you're out there all by yourself beau i don't know what's happening what's new at the table this is so cute look at all the little barrels fifteen plus whatever make up for our shortcomings taliesin you cut like a little v cake with head oh that's what rouges can do they can use their bonus action to dash oh okay i'm going to sit down on the ground and open the tent and look out then i say oh shit i shouldn't have used all those spells earlier all i have is sacred flame and i'm going to do that i'm going to shoot sacred flame and at the same time i'm going to go frumpkin come here let me pet you yeah it's a 13 dexterity that doesn't

cantrip yes it took someone going unconscious guys can i try and do some medicine on him does that heal him at all i don't think so i have doughnuts some paint supplies i'm the cleric what is this i've never traveled with a bunch of people that i thought would die in front of me okay i never needed a healer's kit before (gasps) you have a healer's kit oh my gosh i've always wanted one of these for so long yes how do i use this though i open it and rummage through a bunch of shit here should i what if i roll a one on it a nine yeah is any of their armor still usable because we can pretend we're guards for some reason oh we should get out of here soon though because guards could be coming it jumped off that way yeah there's probably more coming i would think i don't know who should run where i have his head in my lap and i'm slapping his cheek consistently ooh ooh good we can put molly on the back of the wagon that way we can get him out of here and the guards' bodies too that way we can drop them off away from the carnival and people won't think it's related i'm a very wise person okay i'll do it i go pick him up and carry him somebody needs to grab molly he's still over there the one with the two horses attached yo can you see it we'll take that one unhook the other horse so we can steal that one too they're outies oh my god don't worry caleb i'm okay he's alive you're awake how do you feel i saved your life you should be really grateful are you sure what are you going to say to them don't say that we were here don't mention we were here that's pretty important i think yeah we'll get them out of it what happened to her did it take toya with it we need to find evidence to exonerate us let's go are we really chasing the toad right now molly obviously did the most damage out of anyone and he's almost dead right now we are going to rest right we can't just chase after a toad we'll die fjord i'm trusting you okay yeah it's cute yeah let's follow the direction that the toad went i like it it's a good plan this is definitely not going to backfire let's go (laughter) when we get far away from the carnival we should drop the guard bodies off push them out so it looks like they were on patrol when they turned into zombies far away from the carnival exactly like a lake patrol take them out of this wagon or a giant toad sitting in the water can they see us if we can't see them very clearly they can't see us very clearly we don't have a light on us go up a little further away from the boat and then dump the bodies it's not like we're trying to hide the bodies we're saying they turned into zombies around here is that stupid oh coming from the carnival that would definitely work will you add my name to that list like normal maybe we dump the bodies and i'll get out and try to make the tracks go away for a little bit i'll walk up the path and do like this yeah but the wagon will come from the carnival straight to the bodies isn't that weird not that far i think we have to go back to the inn right yeah oh okay well all right are we dumping these bodies or what yeah i get out and i start positioning them like maybe they were having a romantic tryst do you want us to sure let's do that oh she's all about shady shit she does a lot of it (singsong) go to sleep little tiefling they're late night fishermen can i look for toad tracks i didn't that was a whole lot of rolls survival 11 fjord come look at this this is definitely toad tracks that lump is the toad so we head towards that boat that hit land if we go towards the toad we are going to fight the toad because you used your blood on it i bet you have a thing where you can click it on that's what we figured straight across it could have gone to the island will you be able to keep tracking it after you sleep he was a fiend yeah yeah yeah it's open 24 hours yeah you should do that let's go i don't think we would have taken the cart past the fishermen are we going to do that i don't think we would have gone right past the fishermen that would be able to identify us the horse whimpers you hurt a horse you rolled shit too i use thaumaturgy and i make the sound of like a predator behind them okay 13 those ducks are scary we're being careful i'm going to-- does anybody have shitty stealth well okay i was going to give anybody advantage but here you go wow that was bad 18 we should go to sleep do we reset our max hit points when we take a long rest i fell asleep in my sketchbook halfway through my drawing of the two zombie guards making out they're zombies so yeah one arm is like off to the side is that our door hold on i'm naked i'll get it no i get up i get it hello did you come back to play some games well you know we might want to brush our teeth no now we have time to-- okay i'll see you soon i miss you already it's two o'clock in the afternoon you said when we woke up i know it's confusing when you speak with the accent all the time cool why

we were in this inn the whole time we can definitely steal a boat he was a sailor that's how i met him as soon as caleb looks up i look in his book what is your book about (gasps) those are my favorite are there drawings of them he laughed at it the first 20 times i said it to him what does it say that is what they look like they look like husks you never noticed him eating people before okay (gasps) that's what was happening to toya maybe all of you does it say anything about it hiding in water does it say anything about it liking the sound of song is it related at all to the periwinkles you were talking about before does it say how to kill it well most fiends are weak to holy damage right 14 reading what's going on but we could help obviously we had nothing to do with it if people are hurt outside and we were here the whole time how much did you say it costs though octopuses are very smart i didn't say i was very smart get ten gold worth of incense you're going through gold very quickly i could help you okay i'll put one in then you have only eight damn it right here this is the lumpiest little bird i've ever seen i feel so special and blessed you guys thank you do we have to get in disguise again in order to leave he can't communicate with us when he's like this can he feel if we touch him i poke him in the forehead oh okay can he tell who did it that's wonderful well okay but he won't know now i'm going to braid caleb's hair i know like a few little braids because his hair is not super long maybe one here one here and one down here (gasps) now we can spy on the people below us iron that's not noticeable oh man i've been concentrating on skinky-doodles all day man all right it's fine marisha and no you keep it i'm a very generous person did you have it fly down closer so you could see better i guess we should go to the big island should we wait until dusky-time okay does anybody else want braids in the amount of time we have to wait of course i can totally do that i don't want to waste a spell this time that's awesome they came separate i thought when we talked to them they said that toya came after kylre they joined the circus at separate times we gave them a hard-- what was it yeah good cop i was the good cop yeah and we got hard information from them yeah and i was like don't worry she won't hurt you then they fessed up to everything they were like we're a fiend and she was like i'm a little girl that was how it went can they all tell fortunes like you no they didn't lie to us they told us the truth what if he's like one of those creatures that lives on the bottom of the sea and she's not actually even a person she's like this light thing that dangles in front of-- yeah i bless you maybe you should go out the front and talk to him and distract him so we can sneak out the window i'm so scared of rolling right now oh no no 21 don't make comments after he just was kind to us i have my hood up you should talk to people that was pretty cool gramps yes you can definitely trust me can i pull fjord aside while she's off doing that fjord that voice you're doing it almost sounded like you actually did in port
