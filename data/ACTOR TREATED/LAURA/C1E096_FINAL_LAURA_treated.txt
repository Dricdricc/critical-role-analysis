yeah okay so we put our dice up for pre-order and they're already sold out in pre-order but we're going to get more i don't know when but soon very soon yeah we have these still in stock though some of these are still left which are awesome and they're so soft and we have all the other t-shirts as well except for the 'dagger dagger dagger' that matt's wearing maybe we'll be getting those back in i'm not sure but all the other stuff the nail wraps and the vinyl stickers and the hats i mean do you remember the party that we had when we all put them in the envel-- sorry baby (laughter) oh i hand-carve like ten to 20 depending how much time i have but-- i'm sorry if they're misbalanced i make them out of soap so-- yeah but you smell fresh and clean don't say you wanna make it with my husband (laughter) which just fell on the ground why is it velcro i need you to stand up with it so we can see what it looks like there was one more thing yeah you got a bunch of things but these are the ones we're passing to you on the show made a lot of money off of them yes yes you have to say yes to that and we love you wait a minute is it really the bay of gifts with a t i seriously thought it's the bay of gifs this whole time i'm sorry okay i understand now i'm sorry he was distracting me i think we had talked about going to see pike's great-grandfather wilhand to talk about the curse with him right right grog and percival you were going to help with that tour to keep him out of trouble huh not very often you saw how much candy they were eating yesterday he had a bird-like thing in the face if he wants to come yes oh yeah yeah we talked about it last time first i mean we'll head over there while you guys do-- well it depends on who you ask she wants to go see wilhand pike definitely wants to go see wilhand we'll head towards the old sun tree were those-- those didn't belong to your-- i go and grab a servant and tell them to quickly remove all of the clothing from the wardrobes in the guest quarters so that they don't do it again i'll go with him yes i was going with you i had said i went with you mostly to get away from the gnomes ooh are there any ribbons around i wanna tie a big purple giant bow around the top of it to see if i can tie a bow okay oh that's a saving throw this is low but that's a 12 it's a bow a big feather like a white plumey feather or any color really are these like jingle bells or big cow bells i want the bells to hang from either side like around his ears right here what does jb stand for she's a little bitch (laughter) he says as we walk in the room grog we found your tour hat and it's wonderful it was sitting on a special shelf labeled 'tour hat shelf' yeah it really was yeah grand poobah and first tour captain of whitestone i know right hey please take a seat which one of you two will be riding the carpet with them of you and percy percy's going with you as well aren't you are you or are you coming with us someone has to ride the carpet with them my darling you'll be fine like legs going out to the side there it's just percy and the gnomes (laughs) 'it's like natural' we're going to the sun tree it's the truth yep it was made hundreds of years ago and was just sitting on the shelf waiting for the first official tour guide we're heading to the sun tree find out about that curse good to see you again that's right he was smaller then too right as she gets up can i just kind of whisper 'cause he can't hear very well wilhand can you hear what i'm saying right now okay is it going to be all right bringing this up around him sore subject maybe i'll let you do it oh but what did the man look like who came and grabbed the big robot i know i just want to make sure it was him your big mustachioed metal man yeah that's the one was he kind of a dick i hope he wasn't very mean to you wow wow just don't say that word again keyleth i mean it's not i'm gonna be terrible can i insight check him i just want to see if it looks like he's hiding anything (high-pitched) i'm sorry wilhand 14 wilhand how old were you when you left the trickfoot family oh (whispers) how old are you okay okay so he was around for a while okay did you know theobold and so do you know what happened to him well ogden said he was affected by the curse that he was killed by it yes we do we have these shirts that are still in the store they're super cool (squeaky) there's a critical role logo on the back (laughter) it's very true it might be a small comfort to know that pike's doing a wonderful job of changing the trickfoot name she's a hero of the land trickfoot is known as hero now she's saved a lot of people it's true it's true it's not a very precise sort of thing it's funny mix things together and then it just turns out oh thank you imagine if it was fresh shadowy being with eyes like burning coal right it's a recurring dream very constant and it has him very worried if he's telling the truth sure wilhand should you remember anything about this curse that we've asked you about please send word we want to protect pike as much as we can thank you we'll send some your way that are fresh i swear they're very good i will thank you for your hospitality i guess so yeah riflepeople and women because there's men and women belt oh my god did his feet come off the ground so there what the fuck should we do can i take jb and ask her did you happen to see my home on the tour would you like to see i'd love to show you all right i take her (sneezes) thank you it is really pretty i haven't seen that one i have you know you can walk next to me oh i thought she was walking behind me is she walking next to me no seriously come over here i don't want to turn my head when i'm talking to you dear i walk slower so this is my home we just built it isn't it wonderful yes oh i went a long time without one as well it feels wonderful to finally have someplace to settle down yeah why is that what are you well yes i know i know that but my experience with trickfoots has always been pleasant she's fiery as well it seems if you could settle down anywhere where would it be whitestone is quite wonderful pike's buttered us up quite well i heard how old was she when she left what was that like having pike leave and you staying behind well you're a good person would you like to see the library it's growing i don't know how big the library is right now i mean it's my particular-- i'm growing it oh well a lot of books about really terrible gods some good gods oh i have something about the feywild i remember picking that up would you like to learn about the feywild i go dig through my books and find it of course have you ever learned anything about the curse on your family have you seen that in books right have you ever seen anyone be affected by it personally well that's good but you've never had any visions you are quite different that's something to be proud of you know one of my very best friends taryon darrington is an incredible writer and i bet if you told him about the curse he'd be willing to write it down oh yes you would go into complete detail about it and he would make it sound very interesting maybe we could have somebody draw pictures for it trickfoots could be legends well yes but there are multiple chapters of course yes we'll sit down with him but i bet you know quite a few details as well having taken care of him for so long we should find tary take that with you yes yes we can talk about it on the way back tary hi darling so our dear friend jb here i told her what a wonderful writer you are it's a growing book yes and i told her it might be fun if we wrote down a little about the trickfoots and their curse something so other people can learn about them mm-hm no i want her to tell you about it and you can write it down that way we have all the details you know you're such a wonderful writer dear there's all those things in the curse darling maybe just write a new book for the time being just a small other book doty i mean if she's willing of course of course you can just tell us a little bit about it while we go get him of course flourish of greed hm now you say 'hollowed out by shades' do you still look like a normal gnome or wow i wonder what that looks like well no obviously but just for detail so we can illustrate it well how can pike be at risk then she's one of the most generous people i've ever known no (laughs) no it's pike yeah a good short book with a lot of drawings-- -- leather cover with embossing on it or something quite lovely gold filigree probably something just very beautiful yeah let's head back don't worry i got so many details about the curse i know all about it oh good call should this just be vox machina okay this seems weird yeah jb said it was brought upon by greed whoa you're not doing any drugs like scanlan was yeah maybe you should take it off it's kind of annoying-- have you prayed to sarenrae when is the next full moon so maybe just try to cure yourself of this curse is that possible we take the potion and then we read their minds trinket doesn't even know and he knows everything five-dollar word so wait i have a question what if all of them are actually cursed and they're trying to bring you in what did ogden say this exorcism entailed and then what would happen we just send the curse out of you and all is well very strong yeah we can be there will jb be there at the exorcism we need to make sure she is just in case no if there is a curse and she is affected it would be good to get it out of her as well (laughs) we're not going to kill you how much was that maybe we just have to ask 946 yeah plus we already said you're gonna write a book about it that's really good you can definitely do it to ogden first then 'cause he won't be able to tell he can't see so if you look weird he won't know perfect cover can you check yourself just pray to sarenrae see if she'll give you a little hint is it okay to leave everyone here while we go yeah i think so shades maybe the curse jb had mentioned that the shades infest someone and hollow them out i don't know what that translates to try it just try it divine sense divine sense that sounds like something real-- she was about to say something that's not bad i think you need to talk to sarenrae would you be able to cloud the gnomes too though yeah where did kash go to in the last year yennen just do it we'll be fine tary well no doty can't mist-form right no doty i've tried to put him in the-- how heavy is doty so she could just double-cast solid so some people go up you come back turn the rest of the people in no oh right it is okay we'll leave in the morning yeah i can totally get that she's not going to be injured in this ritual just the one shade then right what do the people look like after they've been taken over do they just look like-- maybe they just turned into an asshole which i'm totally going to go get they have all that shit in syngorn i can just go right to one of the temples of the moonweaver or something solid what's a diamond for our dear pike it's a good price i say i should probably go to syngorn before it gets too late just to be safe do you have two pounds of lavender yeah so it smells fresh and clean what are you talking about i'm on my way to go give those guilt trips he started leaving them around the house i go to syngorn i should probably have brought someone with me just in case i suck at this that's cocked that's cocked if i've ever seen cocked investigation 20 right well i don't have very much on my person what do i know about the moonweaver oh god imma roll my moonstone dice for this what am i rolling a religion jeez 11 all right i have a small flask of courage i feel like she would appreciate this i didn't think this part through thank you very much that's right what is my strength it is seven i'm as weak as grog is stupid (laughter) you know what i'm just gonna pass it over to trinket and make him hold it i've got a diamond i've got multiple diamonds i'll choose one that's worth-- in my bag of gems-- no that's not right all right fine i've got two diamonds both worth 1500 i don't have a thousand-gold diamond yeah but it's a waste it's okay it's pike it's worth it keep an eye on those goods brother yeah i'll stay behind percy can stay right i think you can take everyone except for me and percy right oh you know what you can tree-stride us through and then you guys head up and then we'll just meet you up there on the broom just me and percy (laughs) oh no oh no he's sleeping are me and percy there yet hey that cliff's really high let's not do the ritual site right next to that cliff -- inward yeah yeah yeah we do that definitely 23 do i see the type of feather it is can i tell what kind of creature it was 32 yeah they took all our horses i can't cast pass without a trace no probably not do i-- (laughs) i'm scared to ask it okay what am i rolling what am i adding 22 but would i have used my-- what is that shit hide in plain sight could i have used that that's good that's good what here it comes here comes the battlemap here it comes it's like the birthday cake coming out what are these badass tary you just keep surprising me that's party funds we got you oh jeez i'll get on the high part on the other side trinket stays near grog what if he's stealing her soul what is he speaking you can't try the other gnomes elvish common undercommon abyssal and draconic oh my god i totally thought he was gonna steal your soul and stick you in that diamond i was like this was a bad idea 18 you really should've tried that when he was speaking english common strength check okay did you add your necrotic okay i-- what is jb doing okay trinket's gonna go run at-- i'm gonna hunter's mark it if i can fucker all right trinket runs up i have a feeling this is-- and he is going to-- i don't know do i get one attack and trinket gets one attack is that how it can work or he only gets a bonus attack if i take an attack okay and i already tried to hunter's mark him so i'm gonna have trinket attack him down there okay okay okay one is a 25 and the other one is a 19 oh that's not as very good nine for his bite and then his claw-- oh come on trinket 12 for-- no 11 for his claws i'm gonna stay where i am and i wanna keep eyes on-- ooh i wonder if you have to be in the circle to do damage fuck no i'm gonna stay out i'm gonna keep eyes on jb to see what she's doing yeah oh no i know right i think she's done spirit guardians one other time oh man wait he gets a full action and his companion animal gets to attack motherfucker well tary or doty doty's not in the circle slashing damage yeah do you double it because it's a crit is eight plus one 29 oh-- 21 what has he hit anybody yet i mean if i'm looking at that creature does it look like an illusion does it look like something we've seen before does it look like it's really there i'll come down closer i'll have trinket attack for my bonus but i want to just-- trinket gets my bonus okay so i can have him attack and then watch i want to watch while he's attacking and see and like make an investigation check yeah i want to watch ooh that's a good one 27 okay 12 that was a bite yeah 24 that's the end of my turn i moved-- that was my full movement to get up there i want to move over back
