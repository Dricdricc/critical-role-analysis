you to use on your adventures one set for each table each bottle contains the appropriate number of d4s that you need for your roll ranging from common to supreme good luck and keep being awesome kristin and brad kristin and brad are super duper cool and by the way have we ever had a supreme healing potion we have with 20d4 yeah superior eight supreme 20 we've never had a supreme that's so cool is it spelled right is that how you spell kaitiake the green ones don't taste as good as the pink ones these are for you oh my gosh wait this is from-- hold on i've got to see who it's from

okay i'm reading it this is to the cast of critical role wow congratulations the adventure that spanned nearly a year taking our intrepid heroes across the planes of existence to the very threshold of death's door and back has finally come to an end enclosed is the mounted head of the final member of the chroma conclave to fall to the valiant vox machina raishan the diseased deceiver this is so cool what an adventure this has been this little undertaking started just as a fun project to work on with my sister and thank you all for the wonderful work that you do to bring this amazing story to so many but it quickly turned into something much more important than that it was the spark that reignited my passion for my craft and rekindled my love for the wonderful shared storytelling experience of dungeons and dragons and for that i can't thank you enough with the death of the final member of the chroma conclave-- (exclaiming) you've just got to lance them you know sometimes you've got to go to the doctor even if it's too big-- it's satisfying i think with the death of the final-- that's just scary don't do this with the death of the final member of the chroma conclave it brings this wonderful project and my own adventure to a close it has a been a truly incredible experience to be able to share my sister's and my talents with you all and with the amazing critters we now embark to find our next project and see where that will take us if i could make one request when you get all of the mounts hung could you get us a picture of the set please that would make me and my sister two very happy critters also says liam the offer still stands do you know what this is if you or your kids would like a custom trophy mount to commemorate their victory over a mighty foe they'd be happy to send one your way oh too bad vox machina killed you how heavy is it wow i can't wait to see all of them hung up next to each other i feel like these are just too fragile to be in a car fight no but i'm saying if they're hanging on the front of your mad max car they're going to get damaged they will be witnessed witness me where should i put this so it doesn't get damaged off- oh my gosh yeah this is super limited printing by the way 132/175 you made sure the tape on that side didn't touch the picture right there's tape on that side of the paper yeah let's just keep that away from it we're good stop hogging the joke that would be great because you need to get back at sam for something give it all to me okie-dokie oh this is literally-- this is to vex and vax from your aasimar childhood friend velandris dawncollar i remember him that's awesome oh no by the way i need your help vex and vax and the help of the rest of vox machina and if you come across any vampires
