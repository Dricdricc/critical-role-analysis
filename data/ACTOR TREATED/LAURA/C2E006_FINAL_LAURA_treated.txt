what that's going to take so long i did it i have 138 hit points this random character that i just created is really fucking cool i was alight a level 15 fire genasi alight sam stop touching my shit look at that he rolled ones ones and ones i'm sorry sorry matthew that's why i wrote broad barn down what do you guys want to do today i liked it do they need to feed what gods were you being sacrificed to was it just your parents and you that were being sacrificed did they want to kill you or just take your blood oh so it wasn't so bad they just slowly drained you does it have to be your blood no dreams at all we can steal some things i thought we already got paid let's keep helping we could stay here forever and just kill gnolls but think about how good we would get over time mm-hmm when did we agree that did we agree to that usually when you agree to something you have to say it out loud most of the time unless it's like-- we just agreed to it you said it you said it i can't tell it's a secret oh but she's serious about it i can tell do you want a donut this morning it's a little more stale in the bag i have to let you know do you want one wait when did we say we were going to meet bryce i thought they were leaving in front of broad barn what if it's a street we didn't clarify did we i bet we can ask the guy downstairs do you want some help i'll come help you after we've cooked i'm going to switch out his salt for his sugar 19 after we cooked sure you're a halfling too so maybe you should talk to him oh this was your place oh wow oh no how much gold do you need i just had that too i'm sorry i don't have it anymore but i could try writing to my mom to see if she'll help you i love him so much shrimp scampi butterfly shrimp fried shrimp oh it's a store i bet it's big wow this is a really good talk that we've had i think i'm going to go look for the broad barn maybe we'll find all of those thousands of gold for you and you can build your shop back up we're really tough we have no fear i will here it's a moldy donut be well child the traveler is with you you know my name i leave dick we're going to kill all of them syphilis can come with legs-- i feel their pain specifically their heads too i bet we can find some ghosts do you know where they are so we know how to steer clear ooh that would be why some of them have chunks missing out of them fire hydrant we'll get this stuff and head right out was it hit at all was the store that we're going into destroyed at all have fun dealing with the dick did i recognize starosta kosh did he seem like the type that would have made a little side trip down to-- because he seems like the type intelligence 18 good to know wait wait how much incense do you need on incense and that five sticks was five silver's worth that is a lot of incense to burn do you have any pickles you seem like the type of place that would carry pickles they come in barrels usually you get barrels of pickles is it poop in a jar or is it pickles that's true that is a good deal sir and i will give you the copper no hold on no i've got copper around somewhere okay here i pick some lint off one of the coppers that i have but she would know if you were swindling a what you're such a dick but it's usually poison you put-- oh can you throw a med kit in there with it if you have any left you have things going on it's fine no it's okay i have this pickle i haven't tried it i just drank the juice but he ate it picklebacks are we prepared now to go we didn't ask bryce for any healing potions i mean there are people getting chopped up and eaten but if you really want a cat we might be able to go faster you didn't die nott i saved you i'm think in the middle of a field yes so that it's-- yeah so it seems like less of a trap and if we don't see one then fjord you're the biggest and bring people back but then how do we get all of the ears we're going to ask bryce if they have a horse to spare you need a tart oh well why didn't you say something hold on let me dig there's this one-- hold on i think there's a blackberry one somewhere in here it's kind of gross i'm sorry i can't tell anymore it's all black sorry should we go to the stables then probably we definitely won't use it as bait for the gnolls okay bye i bet they left a lot of tracks and probably some cart things they probably did oh my god they weren't wearing any underwear were they but did it have holes for their butts i'm keeping an eye out for poop (gasps) oh no it's a one if we're sitting in the cart is the grass taller than us or is it way lower than us if i stand up in the cart as we go can i see out into the grass 19 i'm flying i'm flying jack (gasps) there's carts i see the carts i jump up and down in her hands oh are there people in the carts can i see they're empty maybe should we pull the cart over and sneak up okay let's pull the cart over and hide it in the grass oh but our horses what if they get eaten but how are we going to get all the people back if we don't have horses to pull the cart i heard a groan i'm going to-- does anybody have to sneeze travis and anybody feel like they need to-- because bless you i give you blessing of the trickster you have advantage on stealth we're hiding it in the tall grass what was our loose plan we didn't see any of them but we won't be able to pull the cart i'm really strong but i don't know if i can carry that many people i am really strong though that's not normally how you test strength towards the three carts me 13 i get some grass and i put it on the cart yeah do it do it ten minutes okay but what is the order of the line ten (whispers) we should kill them sure yeah i'm going to hide i use sacred flame on the one next it it just has to make a dex save of over 13 yay then he gets four more damage radiant you need to not use that dice for the rest of the night everybody but beau you were missing like crazy on that one hey look we can use this hyena meat as bait toss them into the grass then to get them out of view okay i'll pick them up and throw them as far as i can into the grass thank you hey what happened to the little bunny though i'm going to look for the little white rabbit that's really sad they ate it it looks like how we put the stuff over the cart that's way smarter that what we did it could fit in a backpack maybe roll up throw it on the cart as we're leaving like in skyrim just wheels of cheese all the cheese well but what if it alerts a lot of the gnolls and then we don't have the element of surprise at all anymore it doesn't look that bad to me what does that mean is that where the brave comes from oh my god this is awesome yeah you won't be able to see anything through it it's like those birds that hit our windows at home i'm gonna bless you before you go so you can be sneakier are we going in oh okay just tickle his balls oh no you didn't see that good phew are you stealthed guiding bolt on the one closest to me 21 six nine ten ten points oh wow i understood that it was scary oh yeah that's the thing it stays up super good (singsong) i cut off the ears our pickle jar-- matt and ooh what are all these bags in here yeah i didn't even react to it he had to point it out do i get advantage because they're helping that is not as good investigation 11 we should write this stuff down is it metal did you say with wax well i have it then the water-- a water jug and an ale jug oh so i can't carry that with me they're big it's hooded so you can close off the light yeah i found a small rod and a crowbar and a sledgehammer is it heavy oh shit give me my pencil though no can i put the sledgehammer on my back my shield oh can you do that i can look for them well what did that one look like that you got hit with before maybe look for ropes crossing the ground which one are we going down though there's two entrances aren't there you should actually stealth though this time okay you have a blessing with advantage i was going to say left i knew do either of the two paths have more tracks coming in and out of them let's go down the right one no i agree unless they want us to think it's the path that they've trapped that's right and it's actually the path that is least resistance we're stealthing the right we were stealthing we were stealthing okay yeah i can see in the dark i'll look 11 no he has advantage now sorry 15 oh no (whisper) should we stop this should we kill them all the big mama jama while that's happening i'm going to cast very quietly cure wounds on nott next to me because i saw you're bleeding yo you just regained nine hit points yay yeah let's kill them but they're little the hyenas are little oh one's an archer two's an archer three's an archer shit four's an archer oh wouldn't that be really loud wouldn't that draw them back though it might bring the whole thing down on us yeah definitely i feel like we should do that when we're leaving we shouldn't do that before we go in because we're not going to be able to get to anything well yeah but this is very loud it would draw things up here we can try attacking them and if it gets bad then we use the tnt no tnt get a surprise round we can get a surprise round on all of them no you still have blessing while he's doing it i'm getting ready i'm doing this i'm going to cast mirror image of myself mirror image suddenly there are three me's around myself are you casting blur or mirror image i want to know for my own sake i cast spiritual weapon above the two gnolls directly in front of me range on that is 60 feet yeah right there it's going to giant lollipop down and smack one of them in the face this one the one on your left ooh 19 plus whatever that is nine force damage and that's my bonus then i can do a cantrip for my action i'm going to cast sacred flame at the same dude he saves so is it half or-- yes must succeed so it probably doesn't do anything can i run down the steps and hide behind a barrel like it's going to make any fucking difference at all no i aimed at the other one nah you're fine that is so sad 13 hyneas he looks so stupid did you go beau do you want my dice bag okay have any of them been hurt yet okay i'm going to move my spiritual weapon over to the one on the ground directly in front of beau oh i meant on the lower level yeah and it's going to hit him whoa 16 plus five that's nine points of force damage and then i'm going to use toll the dead on the one in front of beau he has to roll a wisdom saving throw 60 feet yeah so he takes 1d12 necrotic damage two it's a little bell this time i'm picturing the flat kind so it can whack i'm going to stay right there and then i make my mirror images be like-- i guess they're doing that because i'm doing that because they're my mirror images oh jeez there's a lot of them that's a bigger one it looks like that is the coolest spell ever couldn't you have attacked with your offhand first oh man caleb so rough tonight i say don't laugh at my friend and i'm going to send my lollipop over and hit it in the face i don't know if it's going to hit it eight plus five toll the dead yay okay seven it's pretty cool i'm going to hang out where i am we got to get that last gnoll before he leaves the room i'm glad we still get shitty jokes oh so it can't get up and move i like that your revenge hits are always really high that's twice now that they've laughed at you and you've hit them while they're laughing at you i'm going to skip over across the upper level towards the far stairs so i can see it i'm going to send my spiritual weapon over to it and smack it flat on the ground jesus christ i don't think either of them hit 13 and lower then i'm going to toll the dead wisdom jesus fucking christ (laughter) i'm going to sit down on the ground and-- all my mirror images do the exact same thing you're terrible i go around and i collect the gnoll ears and i put them in the jar i have a question how similar do hyena ears look to gnoll ears what if we said they were baby gnolls i'm going to cut them off just to be safe whoa i need them i could probably use those can i look at them since i'm proficient in medicine oh sorry i was writing down gnoll sets of ears it's an action you said what was the question i'm sorry oh sure yeah i'll cast cure wounds on him yeah yeenoghu yeenogru or yeenoghu he did say to bring back anything we could find we could do it now as we move forward jesus i'm pretty much out of spells now but that's okay what do you mean yeah oh i don't know it's a big weapon yeah i've got a scythe a sickle let's set them up like they all were making out yeah yeah loosely prop them up like that did you do the-- yeah okay let's go and be really smart and do this oh no this is what happens when we sit down and we talk we're moving forward as quickly as possible that's one way to get your players to move there's babies dying i like that our pickle jar is getting filled with little-- i'm smushing them down so that there's like-- well we drank all the pickle juice out of it so really they just kind of have a pickle stink well i was saving them but then fucking fjord asked for healing that's what i was using cantrips yay
