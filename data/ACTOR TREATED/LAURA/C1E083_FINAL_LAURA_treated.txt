along with brian w foster what are those dates again hey guess what matt and there's some merchandise (all cheer) you can buy it in the shop on geek and sundry there's nothing new this week but there's all the stuff that i talked about last week like socks and hoodies and hats and bracelets and pens-- oh you missed it socks machina that's someday soon guys i'm hoping for that in the store gross really stinky no they should look like barbarian boots fur-lined boots since you're-- if you want yes no yeah i don't think i've cast it since we came out the other side natural 20 for pike no kima did four nothing failed you yeah you're invisible you have an invisibility ring wait the twins are rolling too i should've taken that 20 for myself then i don't know trinket's still in my necklace i left him in because he healed he's in my necklace okay did the party as they were clomping along did they catch up with us at all or are they still that far back before any of that happens though i want to get pike to step forward so she's within 30 feet of everybody as many people as possible can she be right in the middle but wait just a fucking second so she can cast beacon of hope on everybody just one second she's trying to help you pike's like just a fucking second let me cast beacon of hope 30 feet which means that you are hopeful and vital it affects everybody at the time of casting i think it just says range is 30 feet choose any number of creatures within range for the duration each target has advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws and regains the maximum number of hit points when healed i can't tell can i tell if it's really an illusion or does it look like she's really there well i couldn't sense her before when she was in her human form so i'm assuming i can't sense her now yeah i mean i did the dragon-sense right before we came down this hallway and i sensed three dragons down here whereabouts are you while that conversation's going on i want to bamf trinket out and send him around the other way with grog okay come on trinket you're so quiet-- ooh trinket rolls a 19 well maybe she doesn't know trinket's here ooh nice pike's going to walk to the middle where she's in between the two parties like reginald or something what was his name and then pike wants to walk in between the two parties so hiding behind that wall outcropping i'm backing up but i'm drawing an arrow and just notching it and waiting to see if she does anything to keyleth they'll leave a welt you'll itch for days i hunter's mark her at 2nd level because that's what i have i sensed three dragons which she's good at oh man i don't like hearing that that's a bad taliesin laugh 24 yeah i did i rolled for pike she got eight pike got eight those eggs don't even know you're coming oh no eggs you guys eggs scrambled poached that's me i'm going to immediately say over the earring i don't think she's really there and then try to look and see anything any sign of her that i can spot can i see anything 30 oh okay fuck i think i'm going to save-- i'm going to back up against the wall just straight back yeah because i feel very uncomfortable with the situation and i'm going to save my attack for if thordak moves if anything moves at all i'm going to wait to attack it yeah in case thordak moves or i see raishan or something oh my god that would've been so smart though oh no no good job guys i am holding my action until raishan does anything i hope she attacks-- well no i hope we get to attack her soon do i see did i-- oh god i can't it's not my turn no did my hair go whoosh okay i mean a little bit oh bringing it back there's potentially corpses in those cages that could be something all right sorry that's okay it's dead it probably hits trinket's fighting every urge to go lick up the egg (all laugh) come on he's a bear oh you've been dispelled oh yeah well wisdom i feel like we aren't taking this seriously enough you guys 'cause i feel like this could be really bad right now oh my god that was like the addams family version of 'my boyfriend's back' probably the feast that's what happened before and the beacon of hope oh yeah good thing we brought kima nice yeah i didn't follow any of that (laughs) (pike voice) yeah pike is going to cast-- (pike voice) yeah (pike voice) i'm going to-- pike's going to cast spiritual weapon at level four right she's putting it right in the middle of the hallway (pike voice) yeah and then-- oh no it's protection scanlan and then she's going to use-- i guess that's only within ten feet she's going to cast light just to create a little bit of better vision on that pile of rocks in the middle of that yeah very bright i'm thinking maybe that'll help spot raishan or something yeah gotta get a natural twenty on that ugh so annoying jesus we're never going to get it off is there anything standing next to it so it's sneak attack (whispering) i'm your sister whoa okay i'm going to-- i saw keyleth say that she was in fog so can i come around that corner and see her 31 okay i'm going to attack her and i'm going to try to do bramble shot with the blazing bowstring oh yeah okay-- bramble shot isn't concentration though can i shift it over to her no no it was up so once i-- it's like up so once i knew where she was i could shift it okay okay okay that's good that's a-- what is that 30 or something 32 that was-- okay that's-- 26 okay so that's a bramble shot bramble shot with the blazing bowstring oh wait let me (scottish accent) get my d8s out here thank you (all laugh) 28 plus two lightning damage plus six for hunter's mark 34 plus the blazing bowstring is nine so 43 points of damage and then she has to do a strength saving throw of-- and then a strength saving throw oh so she's restrained but she's restrained in the fog all right i'm going to pull out a sleep arrow and do my second attack with a sleep arrow through the blazing bowstring just straight 26 14 plus one lightning plus two for sneak attack so four more and then oh and then a sleep arrow thank you thanks you math genius you 5d8 18 okay well it was worth a try oh and then i'm going to use the rest of my move to duck around that corner and back up yeah i want to be behind that stalactite or whatever-- yeah mite stalagmite i might hide behind that stalagmite really she's invisible though so you don't need to burn the grit that's great holy moly c'mon percival she's casting something oh she is still restrained oh let me find out because let's see you wrote it i mean the restrained target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns oh and it's a dc of 17 not 16 i have it written down wrong oh no oh no there's nowhere to take cover is there hold onto your knickers scanlan even got hit scanlan got hit in there ah balls wow that's impressive the beacon of hope or was it just the one this is like instant run away (laughs) one spell she does no kima that's right wasn't she saving her action i'm disintegrated no no it's not like that 22 oh my god trinket got three but he is he is resistant to magical bludgeoning damage or bludgeoning damage rather oh he's unconscious and in my necklace good job trinket he was within 100 feet of me right i'm glad i moved back (gasps) would he have been further than 100 feet if i hadn't moved back okay 85 you said okay and pike got a nine but she's fire resistant all right she's still up wow that is a clutch-- that is major my eyes are like-- you got upgraded (all sing) oh my god i'm so jealous what do i do what if i die without upgrading my bow you're fine you're fucking fine i can't believe you haven't taken any damage i mean you'd better save all of us when we all die when you're flying around like-- i guess just like walking around no she didn't make it she got five great nope he's been exploded yeah it's so sad he's just so happy no he's a bit of a snooty dog actually barely but standing the other one was-- and thordak is just even more watermelon i look down at her like-- but if it was cocked then it doesn't count it was oh wait no it's not a concentration no spiritual weapon's still up yeah what disintegrate what'd he say no no please tell me that's a natural one that you just rolled and you're taking a picture of it i don't want to roll it it's too much pressure 14 she's not by any of the paladins with disintegrate does the body go away i don't understand well she's knocked unconscious but the armor should bring her back the effect of the armor-- brings her back to five hit points and she's on her feet is-- no raishan's not within 15 feet of her is she okay i can't if ashley's not here you can't kill her when she's not here if ashley dies when she's not here-- natural 20 damn 12 20 for pike what did you do did you just burp really gross i'm still up yep pike's down okay okay nobody else just willy-nilly make some rolls okay do we have any wishes first did she gain them all back did she heal all the way i mean what's going on well fine that's stupid i like how red your face is getting we don't do anything with dignity (all laugh) no no which one okay i'm going to jesus christ i'm going to run over to allura and i'm going to cast 3rd-level cure wounds on her 3d8 plus three fifteen points and then 30 feet no fuck that's my action isn't it i guess as a bonus action i'm going to hide i'm such a loser yeah i guess okay let me see if i have any health potions left though i have a regular healing potion left so i'm going to take that ooh eight points healed and a stealth check can i not have gone back behind the stalagmite i want to go around the corner yeah like that okay that's fine i rolled a 16 i think it's time for some advil (all laugh) that's good that's good so you could because a full round is four attacks or three attacks i bet it's four attacks this could be it scanlan these could be scanlan's final words raishan gets four attacks so if you would've failed that your instant death save would've failed can anybody feel it flying past great oh my god oh my god great she surrenders doesn't matter i'm still alive you guys still standing i'm not standing still-- did you say 21 points of damage oh that's it 13 oh damn it sucks that you were knocked prone yay hit her finally and she's just like covered in blood she's just so beat-up oh god she's like right there just her butt pike okay no she's up she's going to stand up and if she uses her sprinter's boots can she run over to scanlan and cast revivify would she be able to get to him okay then she's going to cast revivify on scanlan pike didn't have it so (small voice) nine god fucking damn it she's going to throw sacred flame at raishan and that's at 17th level which she's at now right it is balls great tight she-- can she do like a heal-- healing word tight she's going to do that on herself then sure 11 oh she's really smart are you okay that's karma for trying to kill pike while she's not here her feeble little mind come on you're going to have a big ol' bump on the back of your head jeez how are you oh yeah he was in the hundreds okay using disengage can you run past them with disengage okay but i'm already in range of her oh really okay how far away if i ran past her would i be able to get if i ran to the other side of her okay then i'm just going to back up i'm just going to back up into that-- dink dink dink-- yeah and i'm going to shoot her yeah i already used blazing bowstring okay 17 oh my god i'm just doomed today 18 i'm going to use-- well i didn't use disengage well that's okay i'll use my bonus action fuck it to do grasping vine it's a bonus action from the ground i'm going to grab raishan and pull her to the ground mm-hm 15 (all cheer) i say you stay down bitch and i'm going to go to the bathroom no stop it stop it god she's just going after percy she had a crush on you man my hand-dragon's on your shoulder (laughing) not like this like seriously sam has stacked up his binder he's closed everything like he's getting ready to go (tearfully) i just rolled bad i'm sorry wait a minute did she even roll to break her grasping vine does kima have revivify do you think no pike has lots more spells she's got little legs like the ultimate punishment for scanlan is he would show up as a spectral servant in somebody else's mansion yeah kerrek just like leveled up to like oh my god what's happening vax are you up good percival how are you percy i go running around the corner no no and i run over to him help him pike on percy i-- oh no is that a five plus what it's not

down pike looks at kima can you do anything no can allura do-- why is she rolling pike's going to cast detect magic and see where it's coming from can she see if it's coming from anywhere i'm going to third-level cure wounds you you're probably at one so i'm going to cure wounds on you 24 pike looks at the book that's emanating magic does it look like it's an evil book at all pike's going to take off her scarf and throw it over it and try to cover it and wrap it up in cloth and ask grog to put it in the bag of holding and wonder if that'll make the magic go away i take the gate stone and put it back let's not walk around this place anymore i'm going to use my rope of entanglement and grab him yeah ferry on the carpet and the broom pike casts light on her mace so that it's a nicely lit thing it's not all creepy and dark are they technically undead then pike's going to use her-- yeah she's going to use turn undead on those motherfuckers but they can shoot fireballs so maybe that's not smart yeah i'm going to just shoot them with arrows and try to get them from far away i guess well yours has a probably good range on it i've got 120 feet on my bow so i'm going to do-- pike's going to do sacred flame on them too pike does sacred flame she's a 17th level cleric now it's a cantrip so it's just 4d8 damage mm-hm 4d8 radiant damage oh yeah that's good 22 radiant damage they have to do a dexterity saving throw cool so one of them takes 22 damage i'm going to do the one that percy just hit oh well there's four of them cool well she chooses one and then i'm going to as vex shoot arrows at them that doesn't hit because the world hates me tonight and that one hits 17 damage these are hardy skulls oh i grab those immovable rods when we get out of there we can go to greyskull keep sarenrae's temple i mean that's where our chapel is in our house i don't understand no kima does anybody know what the fuck-- what was that supposed to look like what it was supposed to look like (tearfully) scanlan does i mean as perception thing if we've seen a teleportation circle before would we at least know that it doesn't look like it's supposed to we don't so we have to make this decision stat but what if it took them somewhere-- oh my god what if-- where did they just go what if we just sent them to some plane of existence what about the ball yeah on the carpet pike's
