any museums or places with magical items in port damali natural 20 i don't know how to spell exalted that's his cat-octopus owl also owl maybe it's like a piggy bank or something maybe it holds a certain amount of coins and you have to turn it the right way can you hear coins maybe they're really jammed in there good maybe it's because there are so many they don't shake around how much money

i'm trying to bring somebody to you right now no he likes you a lot i can tell yeah don't worry he'll make himself known to you no we were around for it oh yeah yeah yeah we were opening her closet mending the rest of the days i'm going to parade around the deck in her clothing different outfits what this is the best thing ever i know i know i know that's exactly where my mind went aww oh this is definitely pinhead stuff am i still seeing from the crow's nest all of this shit happening what what's going on it's fine take your finger out is it gone now oh it only lasts for a little bit i wonder where it would have taken us was it big enough for us to go through do you want one of avantika's hats it would be really big on you i'll tell you what i will use my pretty paint to paint her a really cool pirate hat that is her size okay it's like this big exactly what you want yes it has the tricorn and do you want feathers and stuff you got it one big purple feather do you want any sparkly stuff on it or a bow sometimes bows are really pretty totally it will be a squirrel figurine on this next to the feather it'll be really pretty okay there we go (poof) you look like a really good pirate (gasps) what if the hole disappears while nott is still in it i feel like we should put our head through it but do it really fast you have to do it i'll get ready with cure wounds take them oh my god what if it's a safe in another dimension do we recognize it that's definitely an h with a bow was there anything else in there what if this ball is somebody's treasury or something yeah that's what i mean they've been storing stuff in it (gasps) it's a vault i follow him and sit next to him oh cool okay i'm going to tie this rope around your waist okay then this rope is going to tie around your waist now so you guys are tied together then we're going to hold it up top okay you have a minute if you start to go too long we're going to pull you up that was it yeah do it like what oh no does it smell like death in here right definitely won't lead to anything (singing) d&d that was not a sick beat they're not right next to each other i pictured a lover's embrace is this still the same day it is okay yeah i have an idea what if we put on the red cape and then it does something if the statue behind the red thing sees it put it on or something caleb are you okay who wants to put on the red robe the dead guys i'm going to make sure i'm not in line with any of the banners i'm going to step wide ugh i can't reach sorry yeah i'll do this right back here oh god you should put on the robe did you put on the robe i can help you put on the robe the wailing creature could-- yeah but he is in line with the wailing creature ooh the center can we all fit inside of it i want to stay still as much away from a line-up as we-- like in front of the things i'm going to soften it up with my mouth i'm going to crouch even in the thing do the red maybe it's fire hmm ooh fjord look in your pockets of the red robe look in the pockets of the red robe whoa natural one we should see what it is though should we just go out then she makes a duplicate of herself and she likes chocolate i mean i don't know maybe they brought her on purpose and they don't want us anymore it's possible well okay okay (laughter) he always sends frumpkin in to die does frumpkin hear anyone all of us we're fine don't worry about us we should follow her i walk behind fjord and i cast blessing of the trickster when i touch your back does the floor seem rounded too i'll go after nott hey caleb you know in haunted houses a lot of time they attack the person in the back no that's a really creepy song from that's from insidious whoa that's freaky by gravity can we see any movement outside the flames oh well 11 no should we do it stealthily i'm going to case pass without a trace on all of us 17 that was a neat trick they make badass notebooks whoa there's a ladder you guys ooh a door that works where's the fireplace is it straight across those books look like you could remove them and play with them that wasn't cocked we should have checked for traps and stuff you guys does he have a ring on okay that's where i was going what about a green ring though does he have a green ring wait describe him say him again and he's got lots of rings on oh look i bet it's that guy that's his robe he's thin this is old aww what just happened where did fjord just go i'm going to run up where fjord disappeared that looks like an open book at the end of the room caleb i immediately turn around and invoke duplicity down on the ground near them right next to them mm-hmm five but i rolled a natural one voodoo doll okay i'm going to turn around with my duplicate and i'm going to cast inflict wounds on the cabinet can you do that okay i'm going to do that at 2nd-level yeah that's 4d10 17 20 points yes yeah i'm paying attention to her and going (vague noise) you actually i don't think have pass without trace because i invoked duplicity but whatever that was pretty gross straight through did anybody see what he was doing when he disappeared i turn around and watch it happen it's just a book on the one on the table it didn't come with us what do you see beau okay i'll get down so that you can get up and cast it to come up on the level where beau is oh no natural 20 okay the minute he rears up i'm going to invoke duplicity again six taliesin and yeah maybe you can punch him with the gem is the dragon still on the ground or is it-- okay i'm going to cast spirit guardians on myself yeah so it saves okay so do i roll damage right now okay okay okay no i think it's at the top of its turn isn't it that you said okay okay then i'm going to back up the opposite direction that fjord went yeah to about there i can't do anything for a bonus action right now can i i can't dodge or something as a bonus action yeah that makes sense okay then i'm going to chill out and say oh no oh wait oh i backed up that's okay get the fuck out that would kill us instantly if it hits us at least it would almost kill me instantly is it a negative d4 i know right i'm going to go-- okay traveler please let this work i'm going to cast polymorph on the dragon wisdom saving throw of 15 i'm going to polymorph him into-- oh god i'm going to polymorph him into a crimson weasel but at the same time i'm going to go (shouting) catch him because somebody has to catch him oh no i'm really stupid though a six beau do you have a reaction yeah would it be like missile snare right underneath it oh it's got too much yeah i didn't hear-- oh wait i want to back up no i'll stay there am i within 15 feet of him if he's on the ground yeah what a giant waste oh i rolled a natural 20 i wasn't even looking at it and i cast hellish rebuke as soon as it hits me if i'm alive i use hellish rebuke and i go that hurt in infernal oh god yes (gasps) i turn that was cold damage oh well that's good you get an attack and the fire gets an attack no i'm sorry i just made a weasel and not a fucking cow or something even casting the spell in its vicinity try casting it it's my turn okay well-- taking a cue from fjord i'm going to cast blink on myself then if i try to run underneath the dragon-- -- he's going to get an attack of opportunity on me no okay then i'm just going to dash underneath it no by dash i mean run sorry no i rolled a three okay then for my bonus action-- i get a bonus action yeah-- oh i can't oh i'm going to use-- nope i've already used a spell fucking balls i'm going to do nothing i'm going to tremble he's bloodied he's definitely bloodied okay a single scale is chipped away misses it misses that hits cool no you have to roll for it four okay i guess i'm going to-- this is so lame it's so stupid because cure wounds isn't going to do enough to fix me to where if he hits me i'm still going to go down that is at the highest level i know fuck it i'm going to cast inflict wounds at 3rd-level it's just a touch-- oh on a hit okay natural fucking one it's okay i'm all alone i'm going to try and blink then well if i move it's going to attack me so i'm hoping 19 (cheering) ten feet from where i was you're in another plane oh that's right you have the mote you don't see anybody in there yeah mm-mm no oh i can be ten feet away i can be ten feet i mean-- within ten feet can i get away from the fire elemental at least oh i killed him yay everything's fine but i wouldn't-- yeah okay i mean this is so stupid i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself because i'm going to die if i don't at i guess-- a couple of 3rd-levels left so i'm going to cast cure wounds oh good two ones and a two that's great so four plus four is eight points healed sure i mean yeah i'm going to run around as much as i can around the edge of-- without getting hit without me leaving his melee then blink no i stay no it's fine he's so much cuter than i thought he was his blindsight he can see anything within 30 feet just go what disengage taliesin and just go go okay he used his reaction right one hit point double that oh my god why aren't we there we can't see them by the end i had 13 but if he had hit me one more time-- yeah that was nott the brave i turn and give nott the biggest hug just bury my head in her it's probably safe to touch now i mean the dragon's dead there were lots of jewels on the ground you don't want to stay with us i understand that i would do that too but i think i'm out of the ability oh yeah of course i'm fine (laughter) i'm a really good liar beau i'm going to go to my room (shuddering sigh) and go to sleep it's the craziest thing twiggy forever that set looks killer
