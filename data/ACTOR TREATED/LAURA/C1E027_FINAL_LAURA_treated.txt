they look so cool they're custom order so they make them when you order them it takes a few weeks to get them once you order them but it's worth it he rolled this die it's sacred muscle yeah happy birthday sam i have one i got nominated for a golden joystick award yeah for fiona in tales from the borderlands i didn't tell him i think there's a week left of voting so you can go and help out yes they can vote for me i think you have to register your email address so i don't know how many times you can vote but you have to vote in all the categories in order to vote for the one category thanks baby trinket was down there don't say that don't say it (worried noises) oh no 19 no he's downstairs but you're not going to miss so it doesn't matter are you wearing an earring percy trinket he can see percy getting attacked and instinct takes over and he runs forward and he claws him that does not hit that's a natural 20 oh that's the wrong thing that's a 2d4 17 damage does that count if i hit it into my box and it slammed into the side does that count or should i let it roll naturally 17 marisha and you're welcome i got 17 but jarett's got him trinket's up he's going to try to jump and land on top of the ghostly thing and bite its face i don't know how to do that i'm having an issue here because i have 18 in parentheses and then i wrote a 20 and i circled it and i don't know why 18 is probably-- he does he's got his bulette armor man he's a cannonball what am i doing a strength 17 yes that didn't count because it slipped out of my hand that was even worse than the other one so 11 it slipped out of my hand it shouldn't count if it goes like that 20 but he's gone prone i want to run down and shoot something can i see anything can i ricochet an arrow to hit that was the same one each time 28 oh i didn't fucking hunter's mark him god damn it fuck 15 now i'm going to hunter's mark him and i'm going to hit him again can i do that all right that one doesn't hit doesn't matter doesn't hit anyway i missed it i hunter's mark him jarett did it do any holy damage don't you double it you had to double 19 oh right oh man that's going to be loud as fuck trinket roars rushes forward oh all right then he stays there so he's actually locked in the thing still okay can i move forward so i can see all right yeah i'll do that i'll shoot him he's hunter's marked already okay good 15 16 yes and then 14 doesn't hit and trinket can he get up to him oh but i took all the attacks trinket stays in the corner then because he can't do shit yeah (giggling) you softened the shit of him i run up and i cast cure wounds on him 17 do i add my wisdom to that then it's 20 what was that thing oh he's faced these things before that's what it is do you know from your previous experience if there's any way to protect against them other than setting up walls does anybody know how to protect against air stalkers we were unprepared to warn you i'm sorry jarett's up for anything well maybe it's best not to leave him down here but you know what you're still alive that is one of uriel's staff in which case we cannot talk to them right now i think it's probably better to bring him upstairs because if it's locked we can't get to him very quickly and you have my axe desmond dear let's go upstairs grog that bed needs to go back up to the guest room yeah we need to sleep 16 but my passive is 21 motherfucker you are sneaky i need to talk to you help yourself to a frittata let him talk can i roll for insight i know that was a shit roll nine shit that makes sense do you it's only uriel or do you think it's the rest of the council as well oh shit they could have gotten any of us is it possible to sneak into his room and restore him without anybody knowing what if keyleth who can do it polymorphed into a fly or a very small creature traveled on you you snuck in she popped out did the thing money so then you go with them and dimension door out uriel if he's got his mind controlled it doesn't matter if we try to clear our names he's going to find us guilty no they're not they're not going to let us go please we need your input you gave them the wheel i didn't know we had a whole army at our disposal that's wonderful to hear here's the thing he's going to find out stuff about the briarwoods what's the fucking point of him going if we're just going to go attack the briarwoods before we know what he knows we need to let him go find out his shit take care of uriel wait until he gets back go take out the briarwoods-- a what as roaches or bugs roly-polies so they'd have to pop out can you shrink yourself and still do magic teeny-tiny either of you seeker what do you think what was your goal of coming here that would be lovely what about being invisible can you cast spells while you're invisible it's super-duper cool here's the thing it's not going to be just two i don't think it's going to be an entire town of people that they've controlled yeah but seeker asum knows all the ins and outs of the palace we'd have to do it stat but he knows how to get in could you distract people it's fucking your family it's the people that attacked your family do you have no contribution to this we're choosing to do it and then leave yes wait before you go could i talk to you were you going to say anything else because i'll talk to you in private i'll follow you out yes i do you're a ranger you're very sneaky i've only ever seen people like thieves like my brother do things like you've done can you teach me anything that you know to help me maybe be a little more stealthy as well i appreciate it utmost okay he really really does ooh that's good you're already 1200 in how much more would you have to put in i'm training yes get me some holy arrows i wanted some holy arrows or holy water try to get some holy water holy oil yeah i gave him gold to do it what does that do do it get one for everyone yeah technically but still how much do you need talk her down how about we stick to the level we're at good job grog 17 feet 17 whole feet of mirrors we got really bored and we left six days per arrow (screams) plus we didn't get any holy water we only got holy oil to put on our weapons don't put it in a bag of holding percy's used to unstable things oh look at this so fancy oh god i go find jarett and i give him 200 gold and i say do not let-- desmond leave your side watch him watch for invisible anything protect him with everything you can i just gave him 200 fucking gold and yeah everybody-- fuck i give a hundred-- i give another 200 to him and tell him to pass it out to the rest of the guard we'll be back soon and add another guard to the watch thank you shall we head out did i learn anything from seeker asum ah jeez really what if i roll like shit he is he's so good (fake crying) no that was terrible plus my wisdom 17 while i'm attacking cool liam and dear diary sorry everyone is aware that tiberius is the giant eagles in lord of the rings tiberius can invoke ultimate destruction at the call of whatever he wants i write a note address it to uriel hand it to our main butler who i know his name erwen it basically says uriel fyi we didn't totally flee we's looking for evidence no we didn't flee we'll be back how about that we'll be back and i tell him only give this to anybody if they come looking for us and they're angry i think it's in the cloudtop district actually oh yeah let's do it after i haggled because let's be honest i would've 21 yes it is all right (gasps) you made a map wait where is westruun oh there's westruun that's where we are right now so we have to go-- i just spit on your map percy up through the woods into the mountains whitestone is mountains yeah i can handle both right mountain ranges are part of my favored terrain we don't get disadvantage traveling through there probably will be mountain giants though remember that throw boulders and they will be terrible yes i want to cast pass without a trace on everyone man you know what i would give for a flying fucking carpet right now i'm going to tie the fucking rope around your waist before you do that i like it tie a rope i tie the other side i use a special ranger knot that's really extra strong trinket looks like it tiberius are you still on our side are you with me still will you cast fly on trinket i love you i can climb on him and you cast fly and you only have to use one little spell then do it yeah you can go and i'll just use the little rope okay just protect him no he hasn't cast it on him yet i am good thing i only had one frittata the other day just you and tiberius and trinket oh yeah what do you want to do with the horses they were tied up in a super grassy area with a shit-ton of water around are we in mountains yet so i have advantage what is this acrobatics sam and 11 vax you want to hold me i'm vex grog grabbed me i know but he still said he'd grabbed me 25 can we stealth i cast pass without a trace on us up to one hour i cast pass without a trace on us now oh no terrible i'm going to use hide in plain sight i'm going to see if i can do this that sort of ability to camouflage the opening of the cave to where they wouldn't be able to see it 28 oh i want to use my holy oil and dip a couple arrows in the holy oil because i know i can make three based on what we've done before oh really oh so i'll do that right before good to know you ganked my sleeping bag i ask grog how he's doing you want to arm wrestle all right but we should take watch wake me up when you're tired oh shit should we stealth through the mountains just in case they have any kind of lookouts i cast pass without a trace on us again should we all stealth try at least add ten to it 37 yes as he looks at the clock that's adorable jesus natural 20 a blur of blue (shushes) down hide and i prepare-- do we have any visual on what it could be (whispering) wyvern i look at keyleth keyleth (louder) and i whisper but for sake of microphones do you know of a creature that's blue and fast and is kind of snakey but has arms and legs i've got a really good idea wait no grog pick up something really heavy and throw it as far as you can a boulder or something it saw us with 37 stealth yo it saw us maybe just move really fast away from him oh jeez louise what the fuck it's got so many arms
