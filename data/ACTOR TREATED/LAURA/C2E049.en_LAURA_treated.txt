message see if bryce would be okay with that what do you think i'm going to not be able to do this in 25 words it's so hard this is going to bryce okay oh that's good don't talk in full sentences why

me oh i don't either teachers are cool too you just cared about your teacher good for you well i figured you cared since you were checking up on her (laughs) i totally thought she was your roommate you were really good about that you're welcome caleb we can tell you're really scared and that's okay to be scared we just don't know why did you die too how yeza would they know who you are they're high up then huh holy shit wait isn't that where you want to go fjord it's really bad or something that's why you always make that face i'm sorry caleb well i don't think our actions define who we are all the time good people do bad things sometimes even bad people do good things i think you're a good person i don't think a very bad person would care that he was very bad are you secretly in love with me (laughter) like the skin that sounds like a bad person would they see if we were disguised or would they have to look for us do you know what i mean okay it says it it says his instincts are solid yeza i'm assuming while i find this alchemist obnoxious in his simplicity-- i'm sorry i don't believe that the academy's eye for talent proves itself again it says they want him to produce a number of batches of that liquid the one that we stole they wouldn't kill him then they need him to make batches over the next 12 to 16 months well she's really hot i wonder if maybe we can break him out before he gets there maybe he-- it only just happened are we going to have to scout out and listen in on people's conversations see if we can-- maybe if we go with our insurance company scheme we can say that we believe there's been fraud and he's not really dead or something lady-- what does that mean antiquities do you think maybe they're attacking because we have the thingy okay be smart be so smart it says there's other beacons okay so there's more than one as we continue to invoke the beacon-- that means they have one right --with extremely focused energy of different spectrums and sources divine and arcane the effects unleashed are ever curious and reach far beyond this laboratory the dunamis field often sightlessly encompassed an entire portion of the town with locals complaining of an ill sluggish sensation akin to being dragged down so-- oh my god what if you put the dodecahedron on the tripod thing that we got right then we hit it with some sort of spell i wonder if it would amplify that spell you know what i mean that's true look at me it's only using us if you don't like us do you like us though ja fjord they're way too powerful for us fjord you can control water which i can do too i'm not that powerful i'm just saying they've probably been studying for a very long time and if i'm not wrong they're elves and elves live for a very long time and they look kind of old okay so they're probably-- you're pretty powerful okay you're really strong you're very handsome you got some really cool spells you can make darkness appear it's really awesome yes sir we were we were having a big fight okay easy peasy lemon squeezy maybe we go up into their room at night or something and just you know stabby stab (gasp) maybe i can send a message to him he's such a wild mom he's partying all the time do you have to do it in the morning or can you do it at night oh i understand so we head to the inn i'm going to take everything that we've been looking at and stick in the bag so it can't be scried on or something yeah same mm-hmm three rooms i think should do it three that sounds like a very good deal thank you so much yeah i'll pay for it we were hoping to buy some potions while we were here do you know if there's a good alchemy shop or anything around oh no do you know the alchemy shop what was the name of it brenatto apo-- do you know if this brenatto is around still okay great did we miss the meal already today then all right (puffing) oh really i was joking honey we're keeping an eye out for any cloaked robed elven people yeah we're trying to avoid them i also want to find a crownsguard you have a lovely full beard matthew (explosion) i'll split off from the group so that i'm not drawing attention excuse me yeah i'm staying at the local inn right now i have a friend he's losing a little bit of his hair and he was hoping-- i was hoping for a present i could get him maybe a potion that would grow it do you know where i could find somebody that could grow hair a potion maker or something i don't know what kind of potions can be made do you know okay okay what about alchemy is there a local alchemist or something no oh no the building is gone what about the person that ran the shop that's insane i've never seen a crick what do they look like mm-hmm how did they pop out of the ground did you have to fight them you must be so brave i mean you look really brave wow well all right i guess i'll have to go to another town for a potion can you point me in the direction of this shop yeah okay hey maybe the owner ran away or something right yeah fingers crossed (sighing) no i just wanted to see if they saw him leaving the town that's all yeah a lot of soldiers hit on me it's no big deal traci sam told me to it feels like we're supposed to do something yeah the opportunities yeah we should meet up and then search can we call them kryn please travis and that's what they actually are i think jeff's a really nice name jeff is a great name keep going wait wait wait what is the possibility that your mean people can change memories should i try to send him a message and see if he responds would they know what i do well yeah but i can say don't respond if you're by anybody that you know-- oh that's good what if i do that we only have an hour we need to get our free food was it like a worm or something do you think the kryn came out of the worm thing seven some of us are just hanging out i have a question when you blink out-- i haven't done it very much but i feel like it's the ethereal plane right that we go to the ethereal plane it's another plane the traveler told me about it oh well i feel like we go to this other plane right you can walk through things on that plane because it's not quite the same so what if we blinked and then we could go through where they collapsed the tunnel then we could be in the tunnel and just see you know then come back well i don't think you can do that right you can't blink if the spot is taken up right i'm not trying to dimension door that one scares me a bit yeah that's what i mean we blink right here then we walk where the tunnel was and we go into the tunnel or we could just do that this is overwhelming yussa's pretty powerful i could send him a message yeah we do yeah if you bamf forward and there is stuff blocking the way will you get really hurt that's a little different right the tunnel is blocked about 200 feet in the tunnel is blocked i use thaumaturgy and i'm like whoa that's really cool did you see it there's a bunch of whispers of people going that's so cool i'm picturing like a didgeridoo laura and are you saying you want to look at them because yussa said we shouldn't pull it out especially right now if people are looking for it it could be really bad if fjord is saying that is a bit-- then you know brent do you want me to send them a message your family's still there now it's such a good name yeah it's a little overwhelming i mean this is some serious shit i mean i came from nicodranas and everything was nice the empire is really fucked up everybody went through such horrible things and i'm really sorry for everyone that's all don't worry nott i already have i'm sure there is worse to come we'll get through it though yeah i would like nice again at some point yeah do you want to be a halfling again we should talk to yussa maybe he can help you you're still pretty cool i mean the coolest goblin i've ever known yeah he was wearing pretty fancy clothes and stuff or veth or vott what are they sitting on (whispering) chair'otoa yeah it's in here citadel they have a citadel that's right it's a casino no that wasn't it they were saying that they couldn't believe that ghor dranas was holding secrets like that they had a whole other school of magic that we haven't discovered here wow yeah i remember hearing about her we could go after them we take our cart and we head straight toward the worst of the war yeah that makes perfect sense yeah we can't fight an entire army want me to send him a message what if i'm like hey dude do you think that you're going to be able to escape or something oh boy
