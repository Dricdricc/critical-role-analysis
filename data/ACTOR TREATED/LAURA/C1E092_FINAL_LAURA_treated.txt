well here's the thing darling i gave the other gate stone to scanlan well it would take one person off this plane so no it wouldn't take anyone anywhere also i heard you guys talking about the guys with the gold armor while i was standing right here i heard you guys talking about it and those guys they're guards of the city those imps in the gold armor we were warned about those guys yeah well i wanted to but i was biting my nails really hard i vote for-- for another day here but if we don't find any leads we take it yeah neither has trinket maybe they should trinket's arms don't bend that way trinket you can do it wait i haven't chosen my dice yet just hold on i just need like a few-- okay why's all my stuff in different order oh-- but wait wait wait wait doty's not going to get any advantage on this because he's been leaning against a door right okay good put your whole body into it trinket yeah come on trinket 14 it's not a fair match he doesn't have arm joints he's a real bear he's a real bear trinket go pee on him go potty right there good boy how's that did that seem real enough oh that smells really awful i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry well this is grog's room anyway how's that going for you oh but i can i can oh wait i can cast locate object but not people does it work the same way would a hotis egg-ball be an object would a prison be an object what about the prison door outside of hotis' room well she's her own person it's not like she looks like any other one right hot but the rest of us are normal right because we don't have alter self anymore got it grog-- oh my god how are we-- c'mon really did you catch it can i roll my dice while they're reading a contract no-- no-- no-- nope this is awful just don't do those ones (laughs) appropriate (whispers) don't whisper here i don't know can we ask him how do we know when it's evening here does it get dark of course (nervous laughing) of course does he seem to like notice or care that we're not the tieflings anymore all right lovely what are we trying to do we're just going to walk around and see if we can sense where this bastion of death is the bastion of death is what we're trying to find so that's the prison we're looking for could i locate object on the bastion of flesh just going to keep asking oh no problem where do you find those people just walking around what i do oh this person no i don't know anything about-- i did see those knives right yrat whoa grog how he's writing it down that's amazing oh grog yeah you got pissed on by a bear who by the way-- he's back in my necklace by the way i don't want trinket walking around here wode i guess i'm wade and this is greg over here yeah freddie yeah what is it what is it plus seven (whispers) the ring (whispers) no but she does oh i dunno who has it the ring i want to insight check him to see if he looks like he's-- i feel like he is but i just want to make sure 26 there mistress i don't believe he knows oh shit right yeah no no thanks so much mistress oh i want to keep an eye out for all of those imps in gold 24 whoa but they're not paying us special attention at all okay yeah the chain guys wode i know is he going to know that's true is he like hotis could you do it at a higher level balls welp yeah no i feel like it's human remains i don't know it doesn't look appealing to me grog little by little grog is it salty jeez well i feel like we're not getting very far in the city percy you're not taking this contract tary that's so kind are you sure you want to i mean i've never met a hero braver than you oh right so you would actually sell your soul then your soul would be forfeit how about no on that because then we'd have to fight them i mean we could where in the contract does it say we can't kill them as soon as we release them so if you die in the process-- no then your soul goes here-- but you could become one of those melty guys i'll be one of them so don't die i'm going to go down with you can i insight check him 24 right what was that it was like an old woman was trying to talk to us mmm okay how many enemies are we talking about fighting as well as him and what sort of forces does he have what kind of devils are we talking about oh my lord no musel (gasps) oh those little guys well that sounds familiar of course our father would be named after a fucking imp sounds close e-fucking-nough if no one sees us kill him how will we be arrested all right all right so we should make sure after we kill this big guy not to kill anyone else that comes for us okay perfectly simple yeah wait what oh wait it's a dice tower ooh really that's exciting wait we need to prep anything well what's our plan we go in we fucking try to stealth as much as fucking possible and kill a fucking pit fiend how did we do it-- wait wait wait let's just remember how did we do it last time was he weak to anything that we remember nothing oh so definitely do a feast yeah but we won't be when we go to fight him no but-- so if we rest-- all that thinking are the beds painfully hot okay the whole experience at advantage though right because of the heroes' feast 11 yeah i mean yeah we have a lot of stuff in the bag of colding no souls in the bag of colding but we do have-- we do have half a thing of boar meat and some grain just some random grain which i think is like oatmeal oats maybe all water here is hot i'm going to sit the boar meat down on the ground and cook it a little bit yeah make some grill marks on that thing or eating souls did that use up all of the boar meat or am i down to like a quarter of a boar meat now half a boar meat i have no idea what that means it's gone damn it oh that's the worst eraser it just made a pink smudge across the page that's the worst no this one's good look at us using rations downstairs i assume don't make a scene either it's important just be as cool and calm as possible good acting he did it's vasa the whisperers you speak of do they see through illusions all right okay i feel like a good idea would be to just-- yeah but i mean can't we just alter selves into little bugs or something and get in behind him surprise him and vasa could get us into the keep as insects could be good a spell but it's a surprise attack and then pop out and attack him right from bugness i liked it we can't be insects are those beasts yeah are there any other creatures here that are small that go unseen the size of rats or birds of some sort well shit oh right poor little burning rats fuck it i was just thinking it was a thing but forget it yes let's do it he talks yeah i cast pass without a trace on us yeah no add ten 39 22 they see through invisibility i thought you said the whisperers saw through invisibility okay they're going to be the lookout now 26 freddie you can't end up here after i go through stay here i pop trinket out and then i reach my necklace through and say get in i put trinket back in i don't think doty can go in there it's only for living creatures i can try get in doty nothing no no no don't you think that's going to be noticeable yeah but we're trying to be stealthy he said take the easiest way in yeah plus you put the gauntlets on which are good for structures right great yeah good to know very carefully i want to just peek in yeah dangerous things or-- is she dangerous so quietly does she look like she belongs here is she naked i go join my brother are you awake oh shit (laughter) you've been sitting there this whole damn time oh shit what if she wouldn't have been tortured if we'd gotten here earlier are you alive i can cast cure wounds on her i just want to know if it's safe to heal her how did you get here is it safe to release you i cast cure wounds on her let's make a deal we let you go you don't let anyone know we're here and you don't try to kill us can i insight check her oh i got the worst insight ever into her ten she seems really honest ten i'll cast cure wounds at third level oh really oh then never mind fine i'm trying to be nice trying to save you a damn spell 18 plus-- do i add anything 18 plus three 21 whole points vax can you help me pick these locks i'll work on the legs if you work on the hands which is what oh awesome 24 help out where's your shit do you see anything cool there pike would be so happy right now she loves torture devices oh shit hide hide under the table yeah we still have pass without a trace oh god oh god ah oh my god oh my god oh my god no i shoot an arrow in the back of his neck 16 no don't use the gun (muffled) don't use the gun no don't use the gun will it do ooh yeah oh my god (sings) tova's my favorite person in the whole universe it's like a bra like a little bikini oh no it's getting away we've gotta stop it we've gotta stop it no oh back out of the way of the door well you can move out of the way of the doorway so that other people can shoot at him better maybe in line of sight just move out of the doorway thanks for blocking my fucking shot all right-- well then-- i'm going to shoot him no i'm going to shoot the dude the red guy i'm going to shoot him-- yeah i'm going to shoot him okay the first one is a 20 (silly voice) okay 11-- fucking shit 11 plus four lightning damage and then-- ugh i'm going to fucking hunter's mark him motherfucker because i forgot to do it because i'm a fucking asshole and the second one definitely hits him too (affected accent) so then i am going to-- (normal voice) where's my damn eights okay here they are god damn it nine ten 11-- 11 plus one lightning damage because i suck and then four for hunter's mark was it sorry kill him grog please don't be any more people in there shit oh god yeah (grog voice) that is death yeah make him smarter all right i come running forward and as i'm running forward i bamf trinket out of the necklace can i say are we in the clear is everyone safe trinket go after it which way did it go oh shit he's going to try to attack it can he do that all right fuck he's going to jump on it 28 i know yeah okay first one's damage would be 14 and the second one is 26 and that's-- eight plus nine is 17 shit well that's loud hey buddy try to stay quiet i use my bonus action to hide as well unless letting trinket out of the necklace does that count as my bonus action keep it from getting away be dead be dead wow can we be quiet now i wonder if he knows that we're here why don't you just use your fucking earring he's in the next fucking room we should go in the room we should get in now before he gets away no let's run up and get in that fucking room yeah we heard some stone moving so i think he's trying to get away i come in too i think there's a door right in front of us but yeah we can come in the sides i'm going to follow taryon no i'm following fucking tary because this is smart i think he knows we're here number one there isn't that's right right and there's nothing wrong with that i feel like tary you should make a door on the other side and then we go inside right i mean where doty is standing right now if you made a door right there no that door's around where doty is standing is around the corner well grog's going into the room right now oh my god dexterity oh my lord all right all right oh jeez
