i've always known that about you wait leave it on because you kind of look like estelle getty (laughter) right ready to go my mom called me today and she's like “i'm watching you in the wondercon panel” i was like oh no what did i say (laughter) was it it's true love baby oh this shirt thank you this is our first maternity shirt well half a day and then a whole other day where are we right now wait what did you say i wasn't listening there was a spiderweb in the corner of the room and it's really pretty yes i am why do you ask yes i’m very good at writing letters well i guess we we’ll just have to find a letter within their house and then i can forge it right away i'm a really quick thinker and i'm also a pretty fast writer okay but how will we leave something from the high-richter if i don't know actually what her handwriting looks like yet a public record of her handwriting she is a judge after all right this is very complicated what if i go find the high-richter and ask for her autograph yeah really that’s right she was vain oh yes we had one of those at our house well no we just had a lot of secrets (silence) i bet that the people in the knights-- previously knights-- they would know where lord sutan lives don't we know where dolan lives oh yes harold horris we can't be seen we'd have to be in disguise or one of us yes let's go that way go get him monk should we go to dolan's house maybe the richter's handwriting too ulog’s probably listening to us right now we shouldn't be seen with them go do it fjord you're not going up there with him right because he's in disguise now you look the same beau (screeching bird call) i thought that was a hawk (as pigeon) high-richter's handwriting oh i thought sutan was a title like lord lord lord (as pigeons) high-richter (as pigeon) we need it more high-richter (laughter) we need the handwriting of the high-richter more than lord sutan's handwriting (exasperated sound) (laughter) fuck (as pigeon) high-richter did you get the handwriting did you get the handwriting of the high-richter fjord we need it really bad did you not get it just say hey the whole point of this was to find the high-richter's handwriting as well and maybe-- whoa that is really good fjord you did a really good job in there what if we get some parchment that says from the home office of lord sutan or we can go up a few of us through the actual front gates and then meet up with everyone okay oh i thought beau might be able to get through the gates actually huh yeah and it's not a magical disguise okay (distraught) well it's such a thing to get into the sewers we have to make a distraction and everything every time right yes we won't get into any trouble we know our way around or just at the leaky tap let's just meet back at the leaky tap yeah let's go woo she came through earlier she's with me how high are the buildings next to the house okay that seems usable like a five feet jump from like a swinging branch are there windows on that side of the house is there a balcony connected to them so a few guards a dog i love dogs okay i wonder if anything would lure the guards away from the house maybe maybe a drunk trying to talk to them in the front of the house or something or in the back yeah some people jump up and over yeah oh man maybe we could get some rope and a grapple we could throw a grapple for ten feet i know that we can go get a climber's kit we did a good job scouting this place out and stuff are they pointy-top iron bars i bet it does can you stick your fingers through the bar yeah disintegrate oh no mm-hmm that's personal marisha experience isn't it i feel like that would be a really good idea i feel like it might be a little noticeable to carry around a rug most people in the tri-spire don't carry around bedrolls yes but it's little you're not there i think-- are we good what if we don't want the whole kit just the grapple part of it and the rope and the rope what is fully included in the climber's kit yes that would probably be a good idea (whispering) the cheaper one that i use for different things i don't use them at all okay i'll get rid of-- i'll pay for it simon became a real boy gross spend an hour painting your dick ugh in your butt oh my god no no he’s pointing the other direction they’re looking at him but you were running away why do you smell like beer gross did you go in and say “can i speak to ren” and then somebody else go in his office while somebody was in the front asking to talk to ren oh okay oh well we cased out his house we found a big tree that we can hop the fence with oh and we bought this rope and this grapple so that we can climb well so that we can break into the house yes is that what all of these things are i cast cure wounds on molly yeah nobody mentioned anything about needing handwriting right no talk of his father at all right-- well we have ren’s handwriting we could potentially put a note in somebody’s house with his stuff but i don’t know if that’s what the plan is “h-r wants a meeting with you” the big o we should say big o i’ll start writing that note right now i’ll make it look crisp and-- yeah like evil handwriting yeah got your messages i will move the meeting up and the big o is going to die for sure but where are we going to get this money you keep talking about here’s the thing having seen people be bribed before you need very large sums of money for bribing especially with rich people they’re not going to need 500 gold to do this sort of thing they want 5000 gold for this sort of thing a check an iou “on behalf of hr-- “ so no hearts above the i’s then i write “on behalf of hr-- “ what comes after that “on behalf of hr the plan-- “ “the plan is moving up to tomorrow night at the festival” that’s what i write “yours truly forever and ever your bff-- “ no yeah i thought it was good if i fold it up like a little triangle just a simple-- oh wait should i fold it or should i scroll it can the cat get the dog-- yeah they’ll chase after the dog we can try that if it doesn’t work then we try to jump up and over and relieve him say that somebody really wants him over at the party watching your face matt as all that was happening you were like what are they doing (shouting) pillow fight ow okay we're done maybe we should so that we stealth better we can put it in the pink bag the carnival is going on today well we're not actually going to the fancy gala so we probably don't need the fancy stuff because it's just for the rich people well i figure for all of us to get in we should go through the sewers probably sure yeah let's go buy some masks then there's no point in worrying about things you can't change yet caleb oh and i'm going to write another letter that says something about the knights of requital that says like-- what should it be i'm glad to be working with you you sure are nice yeah i'll end it with the big red door the knights of requital then rip it and then it is just the bottom part and leave it in the high-richter's house oh can somebody burn the edge like the rest was in the fire or something oh and then we can put it in the fireplace like the rest of the letter was burned caleb burn just these edges here but just the edges don't set the whole thing on fire because i spent a really long time writing that little bit i write all of that okay fine yeah then i'll put the symbol but i'm also going to keep this one to put in the fireplace because i think it will be really cool now we have those letters i'm going to keep track i'm putting them in the side pouch those are the side pouch ones is that going in lord sutan's place or the high-richter's place so i'm putting that in the other pouch we are definitely-- this is going to be real good what are we being paid for this is ulog around i'm going to look for ulog i want to look and see if he's around us though i can't see shit i should definitely go into lord sutan's place because i have this really fun spell that lets me find things so i could find the seal i go i want to find this wax seal and it will help me find the one that’s closest you're going to steal some stuff sausage for the guard cat for the dog where are we meeting ulog do you want to eat him even more now oh i wonder if we can hide under the carriages and just ride in it's all about trying to get into the sewer system let's just go to the sewers maybe i can go talk to the guard distract him oh he's not even looking at the gate it's dark outside too oh sure i'll go meet you at the sewer entrance on the other side okay i walk up to the guard evening how are you doing today pretty good i was wondering if you could answer a question for me i was looking around this area earlier for a candy shop and i couldn't find anything that seemed good i was wondering if you could point me in the best direction the pentamarket um okay can you tell me exactly where that is because i'm not familiar with the area oh no oh that's okay 19 yay oh come on (fake coughs loudly) can you help me i think i’m choking oh no seven (fake coughs loudly) oh no i can’t breathe at all though i fall over on the ground and really like (choking sounds) (choking sounds) oh it was my spit i was choking on my own spit thank you very much for all of your help oh we didn’t meet the guy at the song and supper yeah i just remembered it i’m going to the song and supper inn we were waiting for you it’s so weird that we totally missed you though well well well 11 they are-- here’s the thing how rich do you look how rich does he look can i put some of my costume on him i’ll put some of my festive wear on him it’ll get you in the door don’t worry here put this mask on oh that’s great guest of honor for the night he’s a comedian come on it is being so mean seven god damn it here’s the thing he’s not a joke-telling kind of comedian he’s more of a farce kind of comedian physical comedy it’s more like a jester if you will and i push him and-- so he falls down see he’s so good he really sells it but i got you in the door right i got ulog i know i have no freaking clue hey ulog what do you want to do okay we cased it earlier yes it would look really pretty on you i think yellow would look good on you oh wait who sucks who hasn’t rolled yet taliesin i give you a blessing 20 but there’s still a gate-- how wide are the openings in the gate does it look like the mastiff could get through the openings in the wrought-iron fence we could use the tree to get over the fence and then run to the cellar he walks up to him and say-- ulog what do you think you’re really good at this that was at the high-richter’s house that wasn’t here right we can climb a tree we’re good at that and i got this grapple so we can swing across to the roof on the other side or let him create it the first time because we might not need it we swing it over somebody needs to make a loud noise when we throw the grapple over so that it doesn't make a clang sound that they hear i could maybe use like thaumaturgy to create a thunder sound if it happens at the same time okay i'll do that sometimes thunder happens out of nowhere oh good do we get advantage because beau's helping us shh i rolled 11 should i try it it's a grapple connected to a rope so i hand the other side of the rope to ulog so it doesn't fall well i'm strong yeah but you're weak aren't you no but you're precise yeah on three okay i'll throw it oh that was good okay 11 no 12 thunder thunder when i did it more thunder another thunder i do another thunder sound right when i pull it so it doesn't make noise here it is a strength thing though no no ulog was holding onto the end of it i catch-- i try to catch the rope to try to keep it from hitting the ground i'll try i did i tried i rolled a 19 i don't know what i'm adding you can jump ten feet oh dear lord what if you fall on the ground beau yeah just so it's not a one no ones the rope's not-- oh were you holding onto the grapple great so we'll tie off the other side-- yeah (whispers) we shimmy well we do that-- when we lower into the cellar right when-- well how-- is there a door on the roof how would there be a stupid door on the roof there's no balconies maybe like an attic access or something i think we should go in through the roof we already shimmied hey nott send a message to fjord and say hey did we look cool just then pry at the shingles look at how deep these go who gives a shit who's going to be on the fucking roof not everyone can fit through the chimney i cast thunder thaumaturgy there's a fire in there what if we pull up these shingles and like stack them i'll hold it open if you guys go scout what spell i am distracted by looking at this beautiful piece of art i think i studied this artist back at home oh okay it only last for ten minutes though when i do it so if we don't find it soon then-- i'm going to-- i'm sure ulog can look for traps because he's also a rogue right ulog help us please i'm going to cast locate object cast spell i'm going to search for a wax seal like traps or they are just-- so we won't touch them are those traps would set them off oh my gosh how great because we came in-- we have to avoid the traps so duck down it's like the neverending story don't be afraid you guys just go it's like a training session come on this only lasts ten minutes let's go okay detect for traps look for traps on this door how do we disarm a trap flying carpet look for traps in the room i did but hurry where is the glow for the seal is coming from well i need to move it because the seal is under the rug so move the fucking carpet move the rug you just unlocked the fucking metal shit i got to get that seal use the mage hand to move the carpet i hand

ranged attack oh natural 19 that's 4d6 radiant 15 damage and the next attack has advantage against it (gasping) oh no oh no i'm sorry nott where am i oh no how do we get it off no but we can't damage it i'm going to go stand on the bed no but-- no but you just heard nott scream oh no you're going to kill nott we have to try to pull the rug off of-- we have to out-strength the rug oh no how do we defeat this rug before it kills all of us i'm going to try to go help nott and i'm going to do the same thing i'm going to try to pry the rug off of beau that's a number it's a 12 i wonder if there's something in the room that will-- turn it off no because the thing in the fireplace it's looking weak vengeance i will i cast cure wounds on her eight points the rug is shredded he's going to know we were in his room because the rug is messed up okay okay let's gather up the pieces of the rug so it's not you know check the fucking thing if it's trapped no check the thing on the ground and see if

trove tonight oh oh my god we are booking it to try to get to the sewer entrance so we can get back in i've got the fucking letters oh yeah i have the disguise charm you want to try is there another entrance we can go to well it'll probably be faster to do that than to go-- okay we'll book it to the other entrance i'm pristine and sober i know we're going to the gala obviously okay 18 yes we run as soon as we’re in i guess i'll cast cure wounds on myself as we're running okay eight points healed yeah okay so we're trying to avoid the guard so we don't get spotted again and get kicked out again that went really well i think did we put everything back in order before we left the room we did right yes we did the magical rug yeah there was a rug that turned to life and attacked us let's go we go to the high-richter's house maybe-- fjord you want to be a guard and i can look like the high-richter okay yes okay i cast disguise self and look like the high-richter (muttering) oh god yes but she was probably going to the gala tonight there's no time i'm going to put her in a cloak that looks like it had wine spilled on it like covering up the rest of the outfit a big-- a white cloak that looks like it had red wine spilled down the front fjord you explain to the guards that i'm very pissed off because someone spilled their drink on me why are you going in we're disguised and we're walking straight up i look incredibly angry just walking why i'm walking that's 18 i breathe really hard is anybody inside the house there were a lot of traps in the last house we were in why why are we adding more things to this same i'm looking around there was a little brick that turned off all the magic things in the other place so maybe can i look around on the walls and see if there's some sort of-- to see if there's a trigger to stop all the traps let's turn them we turn them together one two three (stone grinding) yeah sure we start walking to look for her room you've been made what's that do you think somebody just got home okay we keep looking for traps up on the top floor and looking for a bedroom nice 15 for me what's a gable window okay this might be a good place to leave the letter should we look for traps in here one more time we're looking for more traps nice i rolled a 12 investigation i respond and i say we're upstairs in her bedroom or office or something oh god these lookouts i feel along the edge under her mattress and see if i can feel any keys anything she's like stuck-- i'm reaching under her mattress and seeing if she's stuck anything between natural 20 (cheering) (laughs) volume one oh she's naughty i run over with the letter and can we put it in her desk to hide it the sealed letter oh is there a fireplace is there a wastebasket caleb i swear to fucking gods okay i'll take the-- oh i'm going to take the torn piece and hide it under her bed then i have the letter left the knights of requital letter where should i put this on the desk as well no we should scatter it around so that if certain things don't get found-- is there any other good place like in her bedside tables or anything like that is there clutter on the desk at all or decorations and stuff i'll fold up the knights of requital letter and hide it under her clock leave a little bit showing in the back so that someone could find if they're investigating are there any windows can we see anything out the window is anybody coming is-- does it look like the gala is ending perception check 21 so we can show this as evidence somebody just got home run run everything's set run out the back door somebody's coming no-- i was going to say i cast guiding bolt at her but-- (whispers) oh i had it shitballs yeah i had it prepared and that's what i wanted to cast (fake sobs) i cast hold person on her i'm just going to do it we should take off while he does it (gasps) we have to get out of here i run down i grab caleb and we run out the back door finally i don't have any spells left that went so bad we’re running to the sewers five steer clear of lightning people we need to get back to the other side oh my gosh they were targeting-- i don't know are you sure they weren't looking for us like the cobalt people i've never seen someone fly before the high-richter's dead you guys that wasn't part of the plan be aware of the rat balloons does it look dark everything went to shit oh my gosh it's so good
