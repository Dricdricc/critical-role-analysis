oh i've already rolled two i know and bring your dice and we'll all roll together we have a gnome travis will be smelling like bacon jerky for the rest of his life oh it really does i'm sure it's delicious i saw let's save everyone it actually is really good yeah once you've tasted it you don't smell the stank you wanna try it right it's disgusting oh no god i forgot about that for all we know the council is lost how do we even make contact with them thordak is in the center of town we know that riskel made secret passageways in different places yeah did we ever find out if he put one in ours did we have one that leads into the town maybe we can sneak in well yeah hi how's it going gilmore disappeared i didn't see where he went what places are left that have a teleportation circle the smuggler's coves all of them that one if westruun is under attack now and we know thordak is here does that mean-- we could potentially attack one of his subordinates though one of the other dragons in westruun by themselves well then we teleport right back out bad idea bad idea oh yeah he is ancient grog he is ancient we can do that yes will you be leaving in the morning then can you go tonight bahamut is a good guy cool so there was no-- you didn't move it you didn't do anything with it it's still just sitting there maybe we can get thordak near the little orb i like it not anymore that could be really really terrible they have children matt chromatics especially from what i understand in my research they do mate but there is no family structure there is no love between brethren other than the continued existence of that bloodline if a child of a dragon is slaughtered and one does find out depending on if it's their only brethren it could incite a sense of vengeance depending on the color but i know of no immediate children to thordak i have no knowledge of the other dragons which have attacked this day (laughs) we need to do as much research as we can matt i have not seen thordak myself in 15 years and i know not the state of which he is in or what power he has now gained whatever information you can gather safely right now is going to guide us down the rest of this path in attempting to take this terrible creature down right but they're powerful people they could help us experience and warrior-wise what about you scanlan you're so good at lying and-- and sucking up and grovelling-- trinket can't talk slave leia outfit with a chain around your neck dragons eat let's just think about it all right scanlan general krieg was here for a while before we discovered him he had friends no but he was one of them we need to see-- get in the city and find some people allura you be safe-- -- and silent and swift and you get back here as quickly as possible it's already morning the next day ah fudge take a nap sleep as little as possible that will actually get us rested long rest should we sleep and get up in the morning and hit it that's true i mean can i sense thordak and figure out i mean is he just settling in that one spot is there anything else around or is it just him in the center being a dick and no other movement of other things they went to hit the other cities obviously what should we yeah hey matt i was helping too mother-- wait okay whoa 24 how the fuck do we get that ability she's so fucking cool do you think that was her or do you think that was drake oh man that's so cool (gasp) oh no maybe he-- okay when you are sensing things does that mean you would sense if they were alive or you wouldn't sense them at all if they were dead okay so they could be dead in the city and you'd still sense them he could have a teleportation circle we go then if it hasn't been ransacked already should we stealth in and see what we can see i don't know i feel like we need to rest y'all i'm pretty low and i'm almost out of dice potentially i don't know what are you talking about yes i think it's reasonably well-hidden at this moment i don't know we should head out we're going to march under the city before we left i wanted to find jarett really fast i walk up and i hand him a bag of 300 gold and i say this is far and away so much more than we asked you to do when we hired you and i appreciate everything you're doing take care of the keep use this money to take care of the people here then i give him additional 100 gold i resist the urge to mug down with him and i walk away i put my hood up get up there see what you see natural 20 stealth stealth stealth everybody i cast pass without a trace i cast pass without a trace on us wait wait how's trinket going to climb up this rope y'all polymorph shut up okay what if we polymorph him into a very small raccoon but he's got hands you know so he can hold things honey badger don't give a shit it just takes what it wants is polymorph a concentration no he can hang on to me will he still get his armor but lemurs are slow dude raccoons are cool red panda aww i love you he's so cute i pick him up and i tell him to hang on to me stealth can we all stealth let's do it you add ten because-- oh no 33 you added ten add ten to it pass without a trace can she hear so 14 chained back up the outhouse go along the wall to the other side to get to gilmore's sneaky and they're like the people in our keep they're past the point of healing i want to see if cure wounds is-- i'm going to just try i take out a arrow and say stop who are you talking about i can speak thieves' cant too i'm reading his damn lips as he's doing it you're a member of the clasp then ugh are you one of the people looting you said you saw other people doing the same we need to get across town and not be seen and we'll make a lot of noise clearing it out best to skirt do it then whoa you're using a 6th-level spell right now no let's just stealth it yeah save that scavengers don't test us stop stop stop you will take it to him thordak listen there's so much more available to you buildings up that way not worth your time right here is it worth your death bringing this to him is it worth your death because you will die here step on and go find loot somewhere else at least then you can present it to him and not die here don't be stupid ugh i rolled so poorly anybody want to assist me (sings) how about ten i've got passive perception motherfuck natural fucking 20 do they they're just looters garthok did you lead us here did you know about this sure why not in his face and i have trinket on my back too late for that probably stay away from huge magical effects 27 natural 20 pike lost completely all connection yeah i think she said she was probably going to have to leave until the break until we can figure out the tech okay i'm going to cast hunter's mark on that motherfucker in front of me and then i'm going to cast conjure barrage at all of them in front of me like a big cone effect just towards all the guys in front of me i want to get as many in the cone as i can oh that's my brother i can see what's happening now yeah i move over then i-- it's a 60-foot cone great so trinket is still on my back he's a red panda i fire it and i shoot forward and that's it huh i don't have to like-- okay cool so i'm going to cast that at-- oh it's already at third level okay whoa 15 and then i add my type anything or it's just 15 for my hunter's mark do i add my bracers of archery though on that 17 and an additional six on-- 15 do i add my spell attack bonus i understand i don't understand i take the rest of my moment to back up against a wall fuck that guy i move my hunter's mark to the next guy because the other one went to zero oh it said when it went down to zero i could move it to the next person i understand oh shit there's two more i didn't see those guys i saw one of them but i didn't see all of them they're going to get sneak attacks on me ugh no two attacks hit okay whoa i like it we ain't seen minxie in a while nice i like that right before it he saw a giant bear appear (laughter) get it loser loser with your 11 ac what how long does that last don't rest ever (laughter) so for every person you hit it makes it better and better and better awesome look at you buddies not yet fuck guiding bolt's pretty sick awesome as my bonus action i'm going to cast hail of thorns so my next attack that hits turns into a poof okay so i'm going to do that and then i'm going to cast-- i'm going to shoot-- oh shit can i shoot through the guy in front of me or to the guy with the bolt or is that too hard balls but they would hit me i'm going to move back five feet yeah fuck both of you as i back up and then i shoot the arrow at the guy in the middle of the two okay that is 22 to hit okay so that means-- i'm casting that at third level so that's 3d10 of damage right and that's just my first attack where's my other dice come on that's seven eight nine then do i do that for each person or that's it that's a ten nice and then i'm going to move trinket around no he's going to move up and attack the guy in front of him yeah so i get to cast-- right so i wanted trinket to do his bestial fury yeah he's doing bestial fury and claw that motherfucker that no the other one that's 14 and then 2d4 plus seven oh sweet that's 11 on the first and 13 on the second very nice very nice yeah this is the best thing ever that is mean he just saw trinket rip somebody else's face off oh yeah it does he's got a better armor class than me he's resistant to bludgeoning damage because of his armor he won't miss this will be sick though if he hit it right in the face you could've been a 20 though your next one could be a 20 it was a 20 another natural 20 oh my god 2d12 so now you can take the other guy because you killed him oh my lord oh my gosh worst intimidation ever we shouldn't have taken him hostage i wanted to just kill him and the dwarf who is looting things now i actually you know what instead of looting i'm going to-- i'm actually going to start using perception to look for any sign of gilmore in the rubble or-- okay i leave him to you all natural 20 on investigation well he's still there and we do have a dwarf that's mind-controlled right now that is probably the best don't touch anything i'm investigating i rush over to it can i detect traps now oh 26 i start pushing on the bed and call for grog and say help me with this there's a door did he get everything i mean did he loot everything are we-- assholes the dragon but wait tell us where it is how about that how about you tell us where it is right now he's going to save eventually he's going to break your mind control maybe we should knock him out right now knock him out tie him up i don't want him waking up and running back to the dragon i understand that grog maybe we should just tie him up tie him up and tie him up to a big stone so he can't get up and run even if he-- now sherri don't attack did you work here we're looking for gilmore stay and guard the unconscious fucks if they start to wake up sit on them or kill them if necessary empress is uriel down here did you make it out the children can you like greater restoration i mean what's the best cure you can do pike 22 no offense darling but you look like shit alive did you see him fall i mean i can cast cure wounds on him to try to help out at all will it help i mean you know more than i would perhaps sent a spy and try to trick him (chuckles) that would have been stupid huh gilmore we called for you i'm sorry we didn't wait poisonous fume it would be smart anyone that was alive that you saw does the cinder king have mind control abilities or is he just super impressive and fared quite well that doesn't sound super good could i have just a little bit of time before we-- oh up top you know i'll be right back just for a second i mean if you guys want to join if anybody wants to come with me but i'm going to stealth like a motherfucker would they listen to you they don't like us very much all right i want to go get that fucking well full of fucking loot magical items gold who knows what could be in there that could help us no no no they never gave it to him they gathered a bunch of shit and they hid it in a well no they were going to get it all together and give it to him but they never gave it to him the dragon doesn't know about the gold if you're scared then go with gilmore i'm going to go get the gold grog gimme the bag of holding then where am i going to put all the gold i've got the bag of holding i cast pass without a trace on myself and anybody else joining me scanlan well then don't be pissy about it we'll be right back i mean it's magic shit gilmore i'm going to get your shit back for you right pass without a trace on the three of us stealth like a motherfucker yeah us three stealth out it's like a 15-minute walk i'm going to look out for that shit this time look see see look at this i'm going to stay separate from the group so i can stealth a little bit better i'm stealthing pass without a trace on all of us then are we all heading towards the well to jump down to the clasp or is anybody going back towards the keep right now and the kids get them back to the keep i don't think we should bring three children into the clasp perfect plan let's go 29 39 on stealth for me plus ten trinket's going with you guys by the way do what you got to do garthok what're you doing where do you want us to meet you which entrance better fucking stealth like a motherfucker yeah 26 stealth pike i'm keeping my eye out for any kind of anything in front of us you motherfucker got it now is all that shit up top going to be open for us when we come back it's going to be a while you know we've got to get the treasure and go back to the keep and come back-- i mean it's up to you i know you need to talk to the clasp so if you need to talk to them and let them know we're on our way-- it's up to you you're not with us 19 i look around can i perceive anything or any people around anything natural 20 dicks dicks no whoever the fuck came and took all the fucking gold can i take one of the shovels and move some of the dirt to see if maybe it's deeper than it looks what a waste can i use tracking to see if it looks like anybody's been here 19 is that 17 or 11 that's 11 okay yeah i never thought when we came back up out of the fucking trap door were the people still unconscious oh okay look the reason i wanted to come get all of this gold is because i thought there could be a lot of gilmore's magical items that were probably put in here people don't realize what they have i thought it could help us a lot but what if it's just one or two people that came and stole everything and we could totally take them and they're like right up the alley like right there can i stealth ahead a little bit and see i said i was going to be right back scanlan ah shit fuck it they're taking it to the fucking dragon dicks no we'll fucking go back hey we'll get back what happened to-- where's gorthok garthok where is he oh well i am i start walking back to the keep what trinket's with you guys don't forget yeah yeah keyleth he talked me out of it i walk past oh you guys are all so wonderful and we love you yes please yay garthok thank you thank you
