yes she really should it was a really fun group in the audience last time i like that they're not new but older d20s i'm pretty sure they're the special edition ones i haven't looked at the store they're the red set i think the ones that were available at our live shows before are in the store i think i may have enough dice to go to-- one for each and every critter they're like barnacles i mean yeah charity (laughter) 19 brought it back oh god just right in it already we're just right in it what is that shut up that's so cool i love it he's got thick skin i think you said that's north towards you really i mean i want to so bad i want to use my spiritual weapon okay well i will i'm going to hold my symbol in my hand and do like this because i've seen caleb do fancy things and then i'm going to make it right above his face really close to his face i'm looking 60 directly in front of his face flat side facing him and then just poof 16 that slipped out of my hand it doesn't count if it slips out of your hand ten points of damage that's my bonus for my actual thing can i do a cantrip yeah i'm going to sacred flame him he's got to roll dexterity over 14 i'm a monster eight radiant damage yes the spiritual weapon's right here on his face who's up i feel like i'm already sweating two shots in his leg a legendary he's legendary i underestimated the amount of damage he would do to us his name is charlie isn't your hex still up from the last game too he's going to hit you hit him in his butt does that mean he's going to get advantage on you now oh my god what's with these rolls no don't say it nobody has ah yeah nice (groans) that would suck so hard good thing he's already frenzied okay molly i'll get you as soon as he moves okay so that he doesn't hit me okay i'm going to move spiritual weapon around and i'm going to use this side i'm going to smack him right in his funny bone yeah that hits then 1d8 plus four that's cocked yeah 12 points of damage while he's shaking it off i'm going to use my bonus action to toll the dead i'm going to use my action to toll the dead he's going to have to roll a wisdom of 14 bullshit so he saw me i'm going to jump down behind north side northwest side right in the corner there i'm going to go (small squeak) and try to not get hit so every attack against you is-- no 23 was not the critical she's got 40 something hit points which you don't do you're just unconscious shit you came close to perma-death were you still big too liam and okay he bought that locket yasha however-- it landed he has only one legendary action for the whole fight no behind the wall i start laughing he's rolling really well yay run away really far don't group don't group up do we win yeah but does that mean we win he's on the ground yeah oh we have to wait it's like turns it's my turn now i'm going to run over to yasha shit could i have reached molly okay then i'll go to molly first sorry yasha i'm going to-- i could have gotten to yasha okay then i'm going to-- because she's dying i'm going to use cure wounds on her my last spell y'all that is 1d8 ten points of healing for you and you're up then for my bonus action i'm going to send my spiritual-- oh no no i can't-- if i touch him he wakes up okay i'm going to bring my spiritual weapon over to him i can move it 60 feet i see okay we have a whole minute i can heal molly while that's going on then okay i'm going to give molly a healing potion 2d4 i think i roll it that's good seven plus two so nine points of healing you're welcome i'm sorry it's kind of a weak thing though (gasps) thank you i give you a big waist hug back i'm going to go northeast yeah oh god then as soon as his eyes start to flutter open right who's going first do it go beau (gasps) auto-crit oh that is painful can you run away before he can get an opportunity of attack on you i did not expect that to happen i use my thaumaturgy to start chanting nott nott nott nott all except i grab my spiritual weapon as we're leaving and drag the giant lollipop out of the arena with me is his hair long or short they looked pretty cool do you think we looked that cool yeah nott always keep your crossbow loaded just like you molly yasha you should do that was the old guy the cleric he's eating him i use thaumaturgy to say in the audience the mighty nein are cooler still throw some money instead yeah did you say all the politicians have already left as well oh okay okay heal yasha too she's really low yeah because they had a lot more people that fell actually so they probably need it really bad but a very tiny dick as was pointed out by our friend beau they're cute together oh she's the one that we talked to before dolan have i ever seen an outfit like that before 19 lady fancypants mcgee so nice to meet you then the dude in the white robes we beat a spider is everything okay starosta you seem rather stressed i'm good at spotting these things the leaky tap yeah sometimes we stay at the pillow trove you know thank you so much what is your name she did tell us we're not going to die the war is very far away from us we should steal everything i need time to go back to the pillow trove you guys i like to think you did the entire fight with it well he pointed them out we should go talk to them what should we say that's actually true you want me to come too i can listen to the starosta you'll be great yasha ask about the xhorhasian that they fought and then ask them how they do so much cool magic then ask them-- ask them how they fly you're not going to go too oh jeez i'm going to constantly stay within a few feet of the starosta but not in like a weird way i just want to like overhear his conversations and see if he's talking about war and stuff wisdom saving throw he just did zone of truth on you super cocked oh i spelled it right kryn is the empress of the drow you guys i'm not here i'm next to starosta is the starosta still here okay i'm still there 20 i'd like to stop the starosta before he leaves the room it's the legal thing after-- oh no it's not the dawnfather is legal here may i have a moment of your time before you leave fancypants yes yes my friends call me jester well i couldn't help but notice your body posture for this whole party has been rather tense i don't know if you noticed but i am a bit of a healer and i'm from the menagerie coast where i did a lot of mental healing as well as body healing if there's anything you need to relieve your stress i'm very good at this this is why i came here i'm talking about somebody to talk to to relieve your mind of your stress i know you have people that work for you-- or the pillow trove okay i can help your mind you just relieve that stress it's somebody to talk to it's very helpful you're going to have the shits later oh man you guys i was really trying to get the starosta to talk to me i am a healer i'm a really good healer no i told him-- i didn't give him a price actually that means i'm really good is what that means not for friends (whispering) i'm actually really shit at giving advice but don't tell anyone okay well any time you have any problems yasha you just come to me okay i need to go by there anyway how long has it been since we've been in town by this point my mom has probably got the package here yes i bet there's places in-- we could go to the silken terrace why not why do we need to go now it's late we did a lot today that's probably because you just drank 15 drinks up early in the m-- are we staying at the pillow trove did you guys divide the money up taliesin and what did i get taliesin and yeah that's really cool i had the fro-yo because it's healthier good night hello have a pleasant evening marisha and i support you too in all of your endeavors nott i'm giving yasha a piggy-back ride i like that you have a handle on your mug but you don't use the handle maybe do the thing you just did she's gorgeous hey that lady that's who i was trying to look like that night you remember when we were at the-- yeah hi do you remember me i was here before you too did you know we just won in the victory pit thank you we're kind of famous now we think we might stay here tonight too because we thought it would be nice for the pillow trove to have famous people staying here for you it depends on what you want to offer us as the victories of the victory pit oh yes but we would tell everybody we stayed here all the time i'm really bad at persuading people today apparently i'm doing a really bad job i have a package probably here anyway so i'm going to check on that i'll let everybody else talk to you about how famous we are now that's it four gold do you know how much she wanted to charge me before i'm going to leave it though because i am walking away i'm at the front desk i'm going to see if my package is here from my mom i blend in with my environment very often it's common i have a package here probably jester oh yes that would be the one i'm expecting thank you so much it came i guess see i told you my mom is really cool you guys oh my gosh (whispers) it's probably a lot of money so we should open it up in the rooms oh here of course of course here's two gold for you i'm very wealthy now now we don't have to worry about things anymore you guys not the best kind she has the best reputation you know hmm who does that oh i do ease people's minds like a tall one or a short one what color eyes do you like the most do you want people with one color eye and the other color eye like you-- yes yes (gasps) scary stories to tell in the dark do they still have those okay when we get the money we should all go out and buy new outfits and we should go have a feast and maybe we can buy new clothes for the horses too because i bet they would really like that it's for everyone i open up the box that says my name right on it it says it right here my name it's not as heavy as i expected it to be that's probably what it is i have no idea what that is it's probably platinum because it's lighter ooh (singing) yes she's really amazing do you want me to read it out loud okay okay my darling jester that's me i do so hope your journeys have been safe fruitful and wondrous i've always wished you to see the beauty of the world around us and while the circumstances perhaps were not the most favorable it has allowed you the freedom to become your own woman i spent a lot of time inside i told you this yes okay to show all of wildemount and beyond the gifts you have to offer and the joys you have to give my sweet girl how i miss you i miss her too so much your laughter your energy i've been sick in your absence oh because i'm such a healer you know and i took care of her so that makes me so sad but it is the trial any mother must endure i suppose you're on your own now and while i will always miss that little girl i'm equally eager to see the woman you will become tensions here are less but not absent given time i hope things will vanish into the past and you may come to see me once more until then i have included a small trifle some things to keep you comfortable creating and free i love you your ruby my mama marian lavorre she doesn't tell many people her real name you know isn't it i love my mom so much let's see what she sent us okay i open the little package do i recognize it it smells really nice everybody really likes this smell blue green yes this is so i can keep painting i used up a lot of the paint that i had at the festival 200 gold that is a really good amount of money 200 gold is a lot of money you guys well i mean when we left you know i had a lot more than that but you know it's because i'm growing up and we probably are learning about how to spend money better so she's teaching me probably that 5000 gold is not needed every time (panicked exhale) i really thought there was going to be more money in here i did i did tell her that but you know what that's totally fine 200 gold is really generous of her that's a really good idea it is a lot of money caleb i'm really sorry about that one time when you were talking about money with me okay that is really great she sent my favorite colors red and blue and green and black those are my favorites to paint with you can mix them she knew i had a lot of white already on me so i can make lots of colors well it doesn't work like that do you guys want to split up the 200 that is true i'm going to put this in a special place so that we have it in case we need it okay exactly this will be mom's emergency fund i'm going to paint that on the bag mom's emergency fund oh it's in the room can we hear are we next door to this room can we hear what's happening i rolled a seven can we hear yasha's in here too you said message received it's weird you should try a different one we called down oh okay yes tell them we want cookies and milk for sure oh that's right but yasha likes to cook hers remember i don't know if they will cook rats here though most of the places that charge a lot of money for rooms don't usually cook rats but they do have other animals that they will cook for you probably like a cow or a deer or an owlbear or something what do you guys want to do in the room now jesus bitch fine bitch i didn't want to listen anyway bitch oh no we missed our stuff well it's fine we did we totally did well i guess we should go back to the leaky tap there and-- oh yeah we can load it up you guys totally missed it we had the best time in the room while you guys were gone for a very long time we had a crazy orgy in our room and you guys didn't even want to be part of it oh you know i'm lying did you roll shit too man will they do that but then any city we go into won't they lock us in that city (gasp) you know what we should do you guys why don't we talk to dolan about it he would tell us he was at the party last night he was with that really cool guy from marquet let's go talk to dolan let's go talk to dolan and then we'll leave and we'll go to hupperdook and then we'll go to nogvurot no because hupperdook is a funny sounding name then nogvurot is where our friends from the other mercenary group live we can disguise you as a kid and they could kidnap you and you could fight them from the inside of course yasha we could ask dolan about that too can i say that while it was last night i painted a picture with the new paint for my mom i'm going to ask the front desk if they will send it to her back to our house in the menagerie coast i mean i have paints i guess okay i'll paint it with the stuff i have ooh colored inks i didn't realize that ooh okay why well are we still all together or are we already split up there's no way we'll be able to get out of here before-- are we still i mean it's obvious we're at war now there's not much to talk to him about huh maybe we should see if we should be some armed guards for some rich people going across the valley before so that we have you know yeah that's what we can do while they're at the library we're going to go by the board first the job board to see about being armed guards and then we're going to go to the-- yeah of course we will well we were right here are we going to war would we get healing potions we do appreciate the offer and we can't wait to talk to our friends about it though what is it why not it sounds like a lot of money for something though if only my friend were here me and my friend nott are really good at solving crimes we're the best investigators okay do you think the war will make it all the way here if you ever need anyone to talk to because you feel really stressed out i'm here i'm a good healer mentally whoa that was crazy 10000 gold what do you think it is do you think it's a dragon or something crazy like that i feel like the gentleman probably works with the city you guys back to the leaky tap then get our stuff together travis and yes he is and we count our fucking blessings we've already left the city anything it was great molly told all of our fortunes we just pushed the giant rotting head out of it and left it on the street hey you guys i never used my fate thingy yesterday because i'm stupid did you guys want to use it today oh did i not tell you about this thing oh my gosh you guys you know the weird little thing that we stole well it gives you this-- okay so you focus on it and you go to this place and you can see it and there's this little gray ball and it goes touch me and then you go okay then it comes out and it goes in your chest and you get control of your fate for one time in a day well like basically like if you fuck up or something like that then you get to fix it maybe no it's like all of a sudden you feel a little lucky maybe let's hide next to the body that we just killed so that you can try it in the cellar so that nobody sees because we should probably be careful pulling this thing out yeah i pull out the box just focus on it fjord i'll protect you i can't remember i think you just-- it can only do one person in a day but we'll pass it around the group so if you want it today fjord then yasha you can do it tomorrow did he say anything when he touched it like caleb did did you say anything no you were silent the whole time no it's just when caleb did it he was like i love you mom and dad then he started crying yeah i close up the box i put it back in the bag we will ride the cart do you guys really think we probably shouldn't become legionnaires then no we should leave town that lady's really nice though she's like a grandma i wonder how the contract works i bet it's like a magical contract or something like that where you sign it and then they have like your soul oh that would be bad i bet he doesn't have any more yet we should have bought some earlier do you know of anyone else that would have some right but seeing as how you don't have any inventory matt there is grace of the wilds which is on the southern side of the pentamarket you can go ahead and have jasna bree maybe help you there if the army hasn't gotten to her first but i digress respectfully it's going to be real difficult this time of year this time of year like it happens every year are you going to go to war pumat but you're such a powerful person don't you think you would be helpful what was the pearl again i would like to buy that please thank you is it the pearl of power i had that as vex do you wear armor yasha we already pushed the nasty head out of our wagon joining the city is protecting the city more than it is joining the war but you're under contract for 15 gold a week the big one's in rexxentrum anyway if we stop by the merchants' guild we may still be able to be armored escorts for people or we could just go yeah let's not do that one just be armored guards oh i thought yes that was a given right i mean we all work so well together we make really good roommates did you want to swing by and see if-- yeah can we pop into the other shop the old grace of the wild and see if they have any healing potions just to check out yeah definitely be back in a week wait do you have any herbalism kits oh great could i buy some-- would i be able to make potions of healing with this yeah okay oh great how many do you have i don't know how i would tell oh then no oh no i only have proficiency with a forgery kit and a disguise kit no then fuck it i don't want that shit can i ask a question with a healer's kit can you heal people when you're not in combat or is it just for stabilizing oh okay i'll look at that okay i'll do it us three oh that was bad yes (laughs) oh no slightly better five well i think we'd have to wait maybe we should just go we'll swing by and say sorry we are declining i think we are probably not going to be able to help out right now you really will after the what what's a hawker like a monster or something from the menagerie coast the menagerie coast is really freaking cool you guys oh shit that sounds really cool what do you guys think hold on can we talk about this pros we get to visit the menagerie coast which is always really cool do we have a time limit on when we'd be able to get him makes sense that's what they said we're really good at it what if we were like let's go after this guy and then after that we'll talk about being under contract like this can be a test situation no he ran away when he was a legionnaire the myriad does some scary stuff you guys how much of the bounty but if we were part of the contract then we would get access to a bunch of stuff can we decide can we talk about this this is where we hit the save point i don't know level five oh gosh oh i'm rolling an eight as well five oh it'll go here let me get-- over on this side you can manage your levels my hit points are super low you guys he got uncanny dodge i think i get revivify now i have dispel magic you guys great so you can go back to the library next time (singing) too many options holy shit you have so many hit points
