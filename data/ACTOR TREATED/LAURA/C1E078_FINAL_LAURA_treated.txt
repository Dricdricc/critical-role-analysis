that was the only time he's missed and fenthras is a plus five to attack and plus ten to damage rolls that blonde hair did something for your complexion though did you think so is it maybe because you had a song on there thanks bro you had a song on there too sam yeah i know you didn't listen to it there's also a couple more announcements i know i know but these are good well last weekend was psx and there were a couple awesome projects that were announced there which is the new uncharted game the lost legacy what what what i play nadine what what what (cheering) yeah it was pretty frickin' cool and those are going to be a long time before they're out but you know it's still really awesome and then finishing announcements tonight with some special special treats which is-- a critical role hat yeah you've been in here the whole time this is out in the store right now as well as critical role dice so i have heard tell that if you get these ordered-- if you live in the united states at least i'm sorry international critters-- but if you live in the us then you should be able to get these before christmas yeah great stocking stuffers great under the tree presents too right so we have a certain amount and i by the way rolled these dice before the show and i got a critical on my d20 so-- they're in the store right now there's a limited amount obviously like it always is but as soon as they're gone we're going to order more but if you want 'em for christmas then you know probably get them soon pure chaos oh god it's all happening so what time of day is it right now well we have to go through a tree yeah he's marching to emon right now they're meeting the other armies trust in them they're soldiers they'll be able to find their way they can all start attacking and we can come in from the bottom we should probably talk to gilmore as well and let him know that he has to fucking join us of course i did divvy up our last potions i feel like it might be smart to get some more but the only place to really buy any is vasselheim i mean it's the only city still standing that we have access to immediately we don't have a lot of time the thing is i feel like people in vasselheim said they would help us but i don't know how they'd get to emon to help us in time it's on its way yeah it's made to take on things attacking it it's not a balloon actually-- i don't know what he wants wait travis is watching so he can just text in yeah grog is thinking about it grog is thinking really hard that's good can't allura send a message to them and let them know what our plan is and then we don't have to actually bamf there i feel like what we need to do-- okay here's what i think our plan should be i feel like we should tell the armies gathering to prepare to attack we enter in where the clasp is we come in from the bottom up exactly they take on the armies while we head straight to thordak we could send a message or we could bamf there and then bamf another place it seems a lot of time wasted i'm sure they hold grudges then they'll make us pay before we head in i don't think that's very smart you said by sunset tomorrow is when they'll be at emon okay right what we need to do is plan a time that they start the attack they might have some stealthy-- scry away keyleth yeah let's go to the castle what did you see anything good are we safe do you think drake would join us got it and zahra so maybe we shouldn't ask him i don't even want kash to come i don't even want him around no he's got one brown eye and one blue eye i think i'm going to go ask zahra if she'll join us can i go talk to zahra scanlan can ask him it doesn't have to be you i do want to ask jarett to come too though darling i gave an entire bag of jewels to a random efreet i'm going to go find zahra zahra dear oh not much time to sleep i'm afraid yes and plans are moving ahead much faster than we anticipated we're marching on emon tomorrow that's how it is all the way well he's terrible he's even worse than we thought armies are marching on the city and we plan on coming in from underneath maybe striking at him where he doesn't realize and we'd like your help if you're willing i don't know if we'll succeed and i'm sure we won't all make it out alive it's a big ask i think so fuck it did you make any dragon arrows i plan on it so many drinks we prepare tonight and we leave tomorrow i assume you know us we don't have a plan really i have no idea what's going on be prepared i'm glad you're joining i'm sweating for her (laughter) i can't scooch any more we're turning into one person sorry it's his own drugs he's made his own drugs up well matt made drugs how much money are you spending you tell me what you need you said one basic that's great can i ask a question with potions do they stack can you take multiple ones and get multiple benefits or is it like you take one potion and that's the one potion you get to take okay cool just checking i'm wondering if we should eat a heroes' feast tonight and then just eat one again tomorrow 'cause we just don't know what's going to happen during the day anymore just a heroes' feast every night be ready and just you know it's yeah we're fine either one we have our potions should we split them up okay we have five potions of fire resistance yes because we already had one now we have two superior five regular healing and three greater what we also have is a potion of invulnerability which is clutch and a potion of speed we need to decide who to give the potion of invulnerability to because it lasts for ten minutes you can't die right when you take it i mean can you take damage when you've got it going it's like a minute of no damage that's a specific task kind of thing so we'll decide that later i can't wield a sword either the thing is if he's raging i don't know if he'll think to switch over but you can't do three attacks with it because it's bigger that's pretty cool could he do whisper and then attack with the dragon sword what whisper is a vestige yes all of them all of them well all of them that we know about that's all we know is that you fight with them that's all we know why do you know more well it would mean traveling to vasselheim one of us could go and bamf back and be back tomorrow morning not as much as we hoped it would no yeah potion of speed fire resistance yeah i need fire resistance oh yeah that's right i could take off my bracers-- done and we also find whatever it is he's protecting and kill that too hey what's up i'm really sorry about all of that oh i like this plan he's good yeah that one do it let's do that let's do that we also have another secret weapon scanlan you do remember the flute right i wonder how long it'll take to bamf over when we play the flute is it instantaneous or is it like it takes a day we'll find out (laughter) yeah no that's great let's do that of course daxio is going to do that yes he's the leader of the army yeah we need to talk to him and open the gates yeah you were talking so much a second ago and-- i think we should send a message through allura she can just scribble a note and send it to him all right let's go right now i still think we should eat a heroes' feast before we go just in case what's the difference really just to be prepared but the day is almost up it will protect us all day tomorrow you don't have to we have party funds for this dear did you just give me 800 i'm just pocketing your 800 and i'm putting it in the party gold so thank you okay and trinket no shh-shhh-- we have to choose between kima and jarett to come or to eat yeah we do and then we're immune to fear and poison right i'm so hungry now oh that's so comforting okay all right so if we could get in talk to the clasp and have them find a way to open the gates it would help the armies plus the clasp which hopefully will be willing to fight i think thordak might be scarier than any of their gods at this point well we don't know where they'll be exactly until tomorrow i do i have a siege arrow and grog does extra damage against buildings and walls so it damages stone specifically the siege arrow i'm a really good archer yeah oh my god thank you so much yes i like it these guys are legit apparently which is terrible it really really is they can go through trees instant we need all of the ashari i fucking forgot the ravenites said they would help us too i just remembered how long would it take fuck are they too far are we expecting you back tonight yes she knows everything about all of us dear not even for a minute i'd rather you didn't i have to do it i have to insight check zahra to make sure she's really zahra i love you when did you even speak to her yes yes i know the feeling (laughs) especially her just know that we don't trust her i don't even know if she's really sick i don't think he really can you're not alone in this at least she's not our friend hello who is it (faux surprise) percy are you here for our later talk fine i open the door completely naked what was it dear sure of course would you like to talk before or after i have a question i have a question i'm going to attune the boots of haste that i took from my brother just now that my brother gave to me and if i un-attune my coldsnap armor do i just lose the cold resistance that's a big drop i'm going to take my bracers off then yes i whisper in my brother's ear just be careful because-- what what be careful i think he has a grudge against you just go you'll be great (laughs) oh shit they're fighting over you darling they're fighting over you they both professed their love and now they're fighting grog has the bag of holding and i don't know what's in it what color are the robes why not via a tree well it's not a battlefield right right she can take us to daxio question if you go and you open up a path to the sun tree can people on this side run through the sun tree yeah the eight of us need to go and then how many is that left and drake yeah yeah yeah he gave it to us the elite swat team heading in there this is kashaw that would be swell if we can huh no no no but we have talked about doing it what's the weakest wall we will have air support yes we have a secret entrance in our keep if we can still access it if not there is an entrance to the sewers towards the water we were told of it by the clasp right wait wait the traverse junction what's the traverse junction that's not what i meant then that wasn't the thing that i meant to say well there were there were about 55 soldiers that's true they should be crossing paths very shortly so after you cut through all of the lizardmen like butter you'll make your way to thordak and brom don't say that word out loud yeah very quietly so what the minute we pop out we send up a flare what if we're not in position by sundown it just has to be subtle something your dad will recognize huh no no no it's air ashari total chaos we make our way to greyskull i wink oh shit oh shit oh shit you roll a 20 and then you-- should i cast pass without a trace on all of us is it too late can i just add it to everybody's if i cast it now i do yeah it adds ten to all of your rolls 30 we're making our way to the doorway we peek in now did somebody steal the poop don't drink that grog no none of it no-- (laughter) we need to pass out these healing potions before we get anywhere yeah all right we have three greater healings five regular healings and two superiors who needs what all right take one okay he wants one matt please okay we have one greater left five regulars so i'll pass out regulars to-- do you need any you you-- there's one superior left oh you already have a superior oh shit you have a fuckton of potions take the superior scanlan zero superior and four fire potions i'm taking one of the fire potions as well so that's three fire potions left yes two fire potions left pike has fire resistance of course darling whatever you need you want to take two regulars now the potion of invulnerability is there someone specific we need to give that to does it quarter the damage i still have it i didn't give it to him you don't have it grog you don't have the potion oh okay well then he gets the last-- no no grog wait for when we start fighting thordak some ale do you do it now i'm gonna give-- i don't know if pike has any healing potions so i'm gonna give her a regular healing potion just for something we know where the entrance to the tunnels are though can you do it to all of us lizard people can't see through that how many can you i want to be invisible can we eat a really fast feast yes we would have some of us but i'm invisible because of gilmore we could just pop down to a sewer do we see a sewer hole this plan is smart wait once we get to the clasp then we have to fucking talk to the clasp all right it's all on scanlan he's very charming kash don't talk when we're in there it was wonderful and i'm very grateful i'm very glad you're here though yes and then we're going to go quickly to the clasp entrance no i don't want to be a lizard person don't waste a spell we do we all followed garthok i tug on kash's little braid behind him i'm keeping watch grog help lift stealthily wait grog put the grate down very quietly i whisper in his ear once we're down in there i bamf trinket out of the necklace i love you very much and for being such a badass i creep up next to him what are they saying i'm going to roll the critical role dice oh man oh good that was good where's my piece of paper perception that is a 28 running away from us and they're heading towards us okay they hate you are you true to emon and then i took an arrow to the knee (laughter) remastered yeah we're still invisible garthok you're invisible and you're far back it's not lizardmen magic oh no i rolled a 20 and a one oh fuck what do we do somebody-- drop seeming drop seeming drop seeming scanlan please wait we're not lizardmen we're still running after them i like that you're talking to matt through the earring oh sell them drugs half the gold half the gold holy i think 12-ish i like that he goes-- and it's a 20 no we've got to get to where thordak is grog picks her up come on she can probably do it through the grates as i'm running i'm dipping arrows in poison i've got six six vials of poison so that makes six arrows or does that make-- three however many i can make during this amount of time because i know it only lasts for an hour so on the tips awesome it's one of those things i meant to do earlier can we parkour up 34 by the way i was totally going to say i was putting trinket back in the necklace before you started saying all that i was just-- it went into it right away oh i want to perception check too just because you know that 29 isn't going to see everything yeah no this is a 23 so-- (laughter) yeah i mean we're invisible about a hundred feet off clear view is it possible to get up and over the wall away from them can i peek my head out-- or i can fly up to the top of the wall and drop the rope down well what if-- what if i come out i fly i move down away from the fire giants i fly up to the top of the wall and drop the rope down so everybody can climb up maybe make lizard people and then pop over-- what i drop the rope down so grog and pike and everybody else can go up pass without a trace that i cast yeah-- can i cast it again right at the keep do we get advantage because we're invisible ah okay good 21 okay are we trying to keep stealthed and then letting zarah and kash-- i thought we were up and over the wall i understand 28 2d10 we want to take sneak attacks on both of them first one hits and then 21 does that hit okay do i get three attacks-- oh no no no i'm not clicking the boots yet augh what's happening so 15 for the first hit 22 for the second and just keep running shout out it's just a buddy cop movie we were out of time are we allowed to say brian that they're going to be on talks machina no we can't know his secrets just yet plus i don't want to know any secrets before we go into this fight
