no you're not the sound effects hi folks handsome sam riegel here only thing more handsome than me is this here loot crate featuring x-x-x once you enjoy the geeky gear inside you can use the box to clean up well all this dust yeah that was good sound effects oh he's so cute (whispering) whaska (louder) mm-hmm oh no the chuckle palace (whispers) i'm sorry oh 15 well it does oh no he's so weird i can hear you moving around me blends in with the sulfur i don't care wait were they walking on two feet or-- oh i just wanted to whisper vax can you pick these locks as we're walking do it then subtly oh god he's making shit up as he's walking i guess we have to ask like hey do you have any cool collections do you play cards have you won a lot stuff like that well aren't we going to try and steal it once we see it or are we really going to try and purchase it or maybe if we see that he has it then we can challenge him to a game of cards that he can't fit into because he's huge and it's for normal people i do oh yeah okay i use it oh do i have to stop i can't do it as we're walking as he's talking i start doing it (laughter) okay and that lasts for ten minutes senokir how large is the forge no that's all right funnel them yeah right has he seen a suit of armor-- i don't know does senokir think that that would be bad senokir where are you from originally that's true i was just curious you're so interesting i guess he's the size of the zombie giants we fought don't fuck it up whaska ask senokir what he means oh no don't you have a lot of fucking weapons in your bag of holding that's not bad greatsword of frenzy oh that's right the helmet yeah but it's hideous and they said they didn't do it very well do you want to try this greatsword of frenzy doesn't matter it's too cool you make mayonnaise out of that all the time he doesn't want jewelry he wants arms yeah but it's not weapons i mean we do have dragon scales we do have a fuck-ton of dragon scales just let it go get it out of the bag of holding give him like 40 pounds of white dragonhide right can we do it like that but it's better if it's one big piece as opposed to a bunch of tiny little pieces you're so strong pike get it sexiest fire giant i ever did see (imitates senokir) great we will what what are you talking about senokir what is that place big enough for a giant to live in maybe describe it i feel like the more we make it seem like it's valuable to us the more they're going to ask in return so maybe make it seem less valuable she could think it's a fucking trinket it could be like nothing it could be like a candlestick scanlan will so i'd have to cast it again i only have one more level two spell because i don't have very many spells do it now because it's 1000 feet no it's definitely on the first floor that's what it is it's on the first floor up high he just said there were windows on the second floor eww you could take a swim in it (disgusted noises) oh shit you can see him you mean a dick do you know how to open this door yeah no shit oh it lifts you could have made any of us look like not-- i want to look around immediately all the walls 29 yeah she already took it though i'm looking at the walls at around 20 to 25 feet do i see it up high on the ceiling because i've been looking you're going to be blinging out we got to get it should we let just keyleth and senokir up on the chairs can i roll an insight check on the whole allies thing i was having difficulty choosing 19 oh no you can't read still (dry heaves) i knew that's where she was going to go with this do we need to all sit on the table then thank god do you suck at it what's the goal what are you trying to get to so it's just numbers at this point there's no way to cheat there's no way we can cheat because the ante's already on the table right there's no way to cheat unless you can fudge the dice it's technically cards there's no way to fucking sleight of hand this shit is there maybe can you pray for sarenrae oh no oh hopefully she didn't roll an eight on that first one we have to be ready to fight grab it and then jenga out maybe it's a one maybe we can perform for her did you ever meet a dragon named thordak fuck big red guy took a lot of fire giants with him this one was special he had an enormous jewel in his chest (groaning) ah jeez does that mean we don't have to answer to you anymore you're equal to us actually madam master do you have any symbols that you can give us like something we could show people so they don't try to claim us for themselves because we're a lot smaller than everyone else here something that shows that we're your slaves is she out of the room and two other giants are behind us what are they doing all of us except for-- jump up and fucking see how it's attached to the wall thank you they're lovely we'll do you the favor senokir of carrying this chain back to your place a favor for a favor (giggles) ooh his eyebrows literally going up when you said that i think he wants to do it saving throw four oh no pike but you're already so little grog pick her up she looks like she needs some water yeah let's sleep in the mansion till we can at least get rid of this heat as long as we know that allura will send us a message if something goes wrong why doesn't anyone go outside at night bless you senokir yeah okay different chains than regular chains okay what are we at hmm yeah we've got so much water yeah but he's got a jug full of it she could be gnarlier than the giants that we've fought the pit fiend run in grab the armor plane shift out can they chase us down if we do that no it's instant remember we checked it yeah that's pretty smart i mean i'm down i think that's a great plan grog yes oh shit can you scry on the pit fiend and you know like a thing for him right we know his name does he have any like cuts on him anything that looks weak so we'll have to wait until he comes out how tall is he he could duck in if we said hey i heard there's really good slaves up in this mansion-- yeah but i don't think the slaves attack the owners very often he could be much more intelligent than yenk was though he meditates is that the hot one in the morning not now the mansion door is rather creepy isn't it yeah can't you make the mansion look like anything you want i mean if it looks like a sexy den or something ultimately if we can get him in a building and then back out of the building great but if we can get him in that building why can't we get him in the fucking mansion one of us that would be bad what if you and i dressed in exact identical clothing and then we're unique we're you know twin slaves although you can only grow us or shrink us by a foot so this would be a really little-- wait if we can convince them that he's broken a law of some sort-- travis and what's against the law here he's the one in the big-- no yeah let's not do that no let's not senokir if you saw a bunch of people who looked the same that went from small to big wouldn't you want them as slaves they were totally hot too oh really what's the most unique one you've ever seen wings you have wings yeah but they could probably see through that shit his are real i feel like they'd be able to tell but whatever we don't have that much money plan a into plan b if it doesn't work what is the sultan's name i almost got it memorized though they hung a bunch of fabric up and lit some candles so we can put pieces of fabric up juuraiel whatever you want to look like like maybe an imp something little what is that awesome be one of those that is awesome oh that's so kind of you but we have beds that are specific to us and we-- no nobody should you can do it grog roll a natural 20 in the mansion not in the studio (laughter) and vex i mean yeah but one's got boobs which one (laughter) (shouting) this is awesome no no make us look like good slaves no i want to look pretty make us clean like pretty slaves oh yeah make his wings when they come out like white wings they only last for an hour no why it's just clothes though no we're saying we're not making his wings look like that yet dude oh senokir hi where are the arches it's voodoo shit wait uten so what happens are these all for sale then and-- okay and then other people come through so if you like do the door thing here then this could potentially be a market convincing enough i mean we'll set up shop and only sell to him yeah but people will see the gazebo appear out of nowhere yeah but we need the mansion door to get him inside so we're not going to have us outside are we oh i understand i thought you said hallucinatory terrain let's just fucking stand here what if we danced yeah set up there then grog you lift him up and make him look super tall and we're doing this around him in a row doing the same move we'll look as we're voguing do you want to give us instruments and we'll all play something aw can we get them go get them go get them and see if we can get them maybe and then we can set them free once we're out of here yeah i'll go over there oh (fake sobs) yeah talk to the guy and i'll talk to the slaves (whispering) offer him 15 for the pair yeah we are going to buy them we are buying them they're so young they're innocents do you speak common how did he find you it matters dear ugh (retching) come stand over with us do we have the mansion up yeah i guess so no no no sorry i'm sorry no no no no we got an amazing deal like 50 gold it was so affordable with my gold yikes no i don't win don't talk to me right now just don't (laughter) no also not attractive don't stop (laughter) aw man that is so sad scanlan should be visible at all times you be careful with them he's not even here no i bet he's in the fucking nine hells right now yeah he's probably sold all the people that were hanging out with him last time can i come out and bow before scanlan and say forgive me master for interrupting but the female aasimar is fighting back i know she is much more powerful than the boys but we cannot control her all of it my master all of the magic i rolled a 28 while i'm outside i say could i offer you some refreshments great master (small voice) okay it's too late because he's outside dude i'm out there with him so is vax i don't want him to hurt them what does that do can you make yourself step out-- no i said there was a female so i'm not saying anything i'm sorry no fuck i get ready the minute well never mind oh god natural one natural one i release trinket from my
