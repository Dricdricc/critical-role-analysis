we just talked about them the episode of dread part 2 came out today-- of tabletop it's so intense you can watch it on geek & sundry i'm not telling you anything but it's very intense i'm so nervous just right into it where awesome you have fuzz in your hair no you got it it's gone god 20 well you're outside you can go which one looks biggest does one of the ghouls look scarier than the others he's a master zombie hunter's mark him i did it okay good well i don't need it because i'm going to conjure barrage a cone at them all once he's hunter's marked while i whistle for trinket to get his butt in okay and then i conjure barrage it's a 60-foot cone i will can we fly the carpet forward can i delay until-- what's your initiative i'll delay until his can i do that oh god get out of the middle of them okay plus your constitution oh really oh no i can't do anything you won't be able to dodge it okay well there's no really anybody else so i'm going to there's no really anybody else-- i can shoot through my fire thing right should i save it oh natural 20 (all cheer) 21 hit him oh actually 23 i forgot i had bracers on good to know 21 what do i do for a critical then okay oh that's not that good 15 for the first one and 12 for the second one and hunter's mark on both that was definitely a six that was a six seven then for hunter's mark can we land tiberius are you alive i go look at the treasure chest i thought you checked for traps awesome good thing you didn't get there in time scanlan okay cool what's reflex is that dexterity 30 as a twin of a rogue can i have your thingy your eraser thingy oh thanks oh no did i destroy the loot aw come on i'll take it to grog because i figure he'll probably be able to use it i don't know if it's magic or anything grog so you might want to have tiberius have a look at it pass that piece of paper over here i'm just going to keep this with the party gold plus one diamond to the treasury did you turn it back into coal whoa sparkles well he's hurt can i perception check around the cave oh no come on don't (all laugh) i'm getting real tired of your shit i rolled 22 on perception by the way 22 yes yes yes (quietly) i think maybe we should not be hanging out in this room right now can i try to get a better look at what i saw it's a big ray of death i don't know ugh ugh double 20s on the table ten what should we do command us do you want us to stay we've never run just leaving me you're leaving me behind (groaning) can it fit us we jump onto the carpet he probably does that was good because i was going to let it go oh yeah does it even matter oh that's good you know nothing here don't spend all your sorcerer's points it's not my turn yet tell him to go trinket run i jump off the carpet climb on trinket and we take off can you go oh you're a shark damn it wonder how far this thing can fly are we all on the boat or are some people still on the carpet we didn't all fit in the boat that's why we didn't all take the boat originally you're the only one still on the carpet then how long is that chain on the axe i don't know oh no our whole party 11 i rolled an 11 trinket is immune to being scared it doesn't matter because i'm scared get it grog get it does that cancel out our fear how high are the ceilings can you pillars it down into the water there should be a dot on one side don't be lower hunter's mark and i'm going to attack him twice because i'm original 16 and 28 oh so i've got to roll a couple more times they both hit they're both high 26 for those two plus hunter's mark oh wait no 30 for those two and 9 for hunter's mark ew put it in a little vial keep it for later not good what was it can we loot him (all laugh) we can make wind we have a grog should we make our way to the little island all the way up and over oh yeah it's right on the edge the only thing is i'm afraid that if we keep using up all our spells then we won't be able to take down the big baddie if we come to him oh okay so should we make our way to this cave how close are we to the cave are we still really far away i'm going to cast pass without a trace on all of us right now can we look around the entrance and see if anything dangerous looks like it's around i'm looking up on the ceiling okay can we maybe try to look in should we just light it up see what's in there hey tiberius i shoot the arrow oh wait wrong eye right right this doesn't seem very good oh you didn't add ten to your stealth pass without a trace well i already-- yeah we've got to try to hide a little bit just get some light in there can you put daylight in there can you see if it's evil i don't think we should go in there but she'll be popping up into the wisps i think just wall it up can we see anything sparkling can we look in and see if there's anything that looks useful right lady kima no because the island's way over back here i think we rest up before we do that can you wall it up all right we'll all be ready to attack on the outside so what are you doing keyleth are you staying in there wait what did you see keyleth what was it was there anything in there were there creatures oh i've heard of gricks they're really fast yeah they slither i think it would probably go to the abyss or something i wonder do they attack things they seemed really fast right percy can you make a bomb can you throw the bomb in there and they would all maybe attack it and maybe it would blow them up just throw it from outside and see what happens we are really close to it tiberius was that really necessary shh we already have a bomb just throw it in they attack it we close them up throw a bomb they attack it then you can throw a fireball at the same time we just have to get them in a cluster just throw it we just need to throw it into the cave is it so hard to just throw a freaking bomb into a cave a stealth check and you have pass without a trace what's the point of the bomb why not just do that you're right it will yeah and really loud take a couple steps in and perception 24 is there anything that can come through the portal what's all this purple stuff okay tiberius is it safe to be near it i got him guys i got him you were rather loud i'm afraid things might be drawn to this beach from that explosion maybe it would be good to block it off i like it no but can't you use your rock-changing ability and squish all the rocks down and close the cave off yeah keep going grog you'll get there so you know what he looks like are those cheez-its you're eating right there okay maybe you can envision the horn i like it while she's doing that can i use my primeval awareness and see if there's anything undead or aberrations or things that are around us that are seeming more active in the center so wait i'm sensing would that help you to know that k'varn is an aberration i'm sensing a really strong energy of an aberration in the middle of town and that's something that would've come out of this portal right clarota yeah yes please there's things happening that's so sweet aw you guys i still haven't ordered mine i need to get my hoodie it's going to be tight don't do that no we haven't rested what are you digging there grog can we hear any kind of movement coming from the other island does it seem like they heard those explosions are we safe here okay he's doing a camouflage-y thing and she can make it look like nothing's on the-- hide yeah he's probably just playing with us right now waiting for us to get there oh no keyleth language what did you see (gasps) you said there is something caging the elder brain right so there's something connected to the top of the temple that's caging the elder brain is it possible to maybe collapse the top of the temple from far away and release the elder brain from its cage and then clarota your brethren could fight the beholder instead of us (laughs) oh the thing on the front of the monster manual that's all you could have said i mean we've killed a dragon oh the horn is the goal exactly we free the elder brain they attack it we don't have to fight it ourselves so if we take out the beams-- it might age you it might do something but does anybody have an aging spell something that causes things to disintegrate things maybe we could rust the metal as well it might be a form changer because the king swallowed a vial and it made him strong he's got vials of acid in his bag of holding let's break the temple clarota clarota you're going to cramp your face if you do that right can beholders fly they can okay what can't they do so they're really very fleshy and weak but he put armor on himself so now he's extra strong reconnaissance what is that so is it possible to try to get her help before we do this or is it something that you have to do on the spot so if we attempt it then she can intervene she can be on our side once we know what we're doing i feel like we should go for the top we have to take out the metal thingy i think we destroy the structure we don't have any kind of corruption spell that ages things what if we hit it with dispel magic maybe get your goddess's aid-- hit it with dispel magic hit it with corruption rust the shit and then it falls like extra bad we don't even know what it does yet we can't get closer what if we fly in over the top with the carpet in stealth put the camouflage on the carpet so they don't see it fly in over the top stealth in spy get an idea of-- yeah see what kind of magic is being held on top of it we were trying to find clues so that maybe scrying would be helpful which it was okay here's another option dimension door what if you go and hug one of the beams and dimension door the beam out you can't cast a portal on the door and make it fall not like portal those are just more things to fight no stealthy stealth just to make sure it's not crawling with baddies yeah but i could cast pass without a trace so everybody gets +10 to their stealth rolls trinket how about kima and clarota clarota should go with us can clarota be on the carpet then yeah clarota come with us clarota i'm sure we've asked this before and i wasn't here because i missed a part of a thing what about your hat what does it do can you make more of them all right try to stealth it are we camouflaging the carpet and we're stealthing ahead being sneaky i rolled a natural 20 on stealth can we check out the thing in the air that was it clarota will those trees attack us are they living and attack-y wandering spores i'm picturing a big yellow thing with little legs is that what it is well that's lovely thank you for your help spiny oh you know what grog i hate to tell you this-- is it our old stealth check can i use my flying stealth check damn it 31 plus ten pass without a trace these buildings are sad oh should we hide can we try to hide oh yeah can i do insight and see if it seems like a bad guy i know i'm just checking to see if he's a misunderstood guy that's 17 yeah can we move into the shadows we know where you are 20 shirts that's it me and pike bought hoodies i bought a hoodie we could all be hoodie twinkies he's taking his time oh no really whoa we're 14 shirts away yes very much that's so awesome oh my gosh you guys are awesome hell elf ooh that's so cool seriously that's so cool we'll be able to see it all of us are kind of obsessed about checking out the hashtag huzzah happy birthday if you say so yeah oh my gosh he made a bear statue yeah that's him what dude both of you calm down hold your peace for a thousand bucks yeah now there's so much pressure (all laugh) eat lightsaber jerk there yeah but now he's in love you're in a very fabulous purple coat right now danke schön did i say that right oh okay they have the coolest stuff yeah we have a bunch of posters at our house that would be awesome thank you i'm tweeting your cake right now you're so amazing that's-- yeah he did so amazing how tall are you travis i saw that one oh someone's asking about keyleth's child murder can you see our heads now can we talk about keyleth's child murdering this was sad big golden scissors but we put them in our pocket and forgot that we had them but there was one kid left i thought you grabbed the kid's waist and he got pulled toward the thing but the chain was still around his neck if trinket survives for 12 months yeah our previous name i think it's awesome some people that are maybe druid and-- i saw what color is trinket and what color is his armor he's brown and he's got silver armor oh that makes sense i'm neutral good i don't think you're chaotic no that was definitely a character thing now we're all nice and cozy wait a sec hey guys love the stream i can't read this fast it's too much you can still trust vex after dread i'm not the same girl whole different character yeah we thought that would be fun yes matt and you were a child actor too (gasps) i just saw one that said laura would you like a giant trinket plushie to sit at the table with me and yes i would dude that would be amazing these guys who's the youngest marisha oh my old brother don't send us shit we are twins what what no i'm not sorry guys adorable we did a job as extras together on a set we sat for 8 hours at the same table and we couldn't talk to each other because we weren't allowed to make noise yeah we thought we were so cool and then just started hanging out in the same circles and that was that yes like literally the moment pike was in the game donatello is my favorite ninja turtle is that the resident evil we worked on together oh okay i did that too yeah matt and aw i saw how did me and trinket become friends okay it's kind of a long story me and trinket i sent this short story to matt-- what was it a year ago i just wanted him to know why trinket was so special to me it's such a dorky thing it was a long thing and it was all about shortly after me and my brother left our family of the elves and we were setting off on our own and he was off in the city and i was making camp outside of town these people came into the camp and basically i trusted them too much they kidnapped me and brought me back to their camp and they were poachers on the black market and i was in a cage and i could hear a large creature in pain and through my own wiles i got out of the cage took out the two hunters and i went to see what animal it was and it was a giant bear in a lot of pain unfortunately it had been cut open from the middle they had been harvesting the bear but they hadn't killed it and it was really sad so i felt terrible for it and i put it out of its misery and felt really bad about it and then i heard off to the side a small animal make noise and i realized it was its cub so i took the cub and i felt really horrible and that was also my first time i'd ever killed any people as well so trinket was very special to me because i wanted to protect him and not let him experience that again i didn't eat the cub i saved the cub and i have never even told anybody about that i never told vax about that or anything so trinket was mine yeah ooh she'd be pretty great carrot top anybody oh yeah i'm seeing that expect a crochet trinket i appreciate that thank you barack obama travis and wil wheaton tom hiddleston so many there is there's a me emote we're talking to vin diesel who is that actually no you know what i've had conversations with troy about it-- i don't think he'd be opposed to joining the game yeah he seemed very interested when he brought it up i think because me and travis were so excited about it-- it grew on him yeah matt oswalt that would be such a fun guest what that just seems messed up ooh what are lady kima's and clarota's alignments can we know that what are lady kima's and clarota's alignments we don't know that you also collected lots of dried poo and put it in the bag of holding yeah the rage-looting (gasps) we were going through this thing there were traps everywhere-- electrical traps everywhere and all of us were being really cautious and grog hits trinket on the butt with the blunt of his axe and sends trinket running through the thing and he just hit every trap on the way through and almost died he guested before we had the show he came in our game you weren't there that was probably a night you were gone somewhere that's what i want to be if i die i want to roll as a tiefling somebody did do that kit's really talented the illusionary giant weird nipple this makes me uncomfortable it's geekandsundrycom/shows/critical-role no i think his intelligence is a four so he's two points lower than you dude they were like eight hours why i know that seems a bit much for you guys we used to play for eight hours there was one time for a 1 that it was a really funny bad fail and that was when we were fighting the dread emperor and scanlan was trying to get the final blow and he rolled a one and the dread emperor literally side-stepped him and scanlan fell out of a window we were dying go scanlan it was really amazing a beholder yeah you did look excited i think you were excited that you thought it might be a beholder and then it was oh that's a good question yeah we saved you yeah i would like to know (laughs) (fake cries) it was so sad all of us are crying it was terrible you were on your way out the door and then we talked you into staying for a little longer because we were getting into the fight and you were like okay i'll stay and then she died oh what's our-- ooh that's a tough one that's so hard i love everyone really oh trinket is the bomb yeah everybody's great i don't have as much fun playing if sam's not there because scanlan is such a funny fun character and your ideas for things even right from where we first started playing the things that you came up with to-- yeah burt reynolds all these different things that you would do it's just so different and a fake mustache oh my god you guys are going to love him gilmore's glorious goods no not since the show started literally pine cones it was street yeah you should i've told you the last five games to get rid of your dice because that's what i do if i roll with a-- i am fickle if i roll a one it's gone for the game i won't roll it again but if it rolls bad more than three times it's out it's gone there is a dice graveyard and i spent a lot of money on these really beautiful amethyst dice i should that's true but they're beautiful no because some people roll bad some dice roll bad it is the dice i'm a hufflepuff hufflepuff (gasps) slytherin no he's not a hufflepuff he's a slytherin what are you we've got a lot of slytherins in our group i'm going to make a liam plushie it's a medicine roll over and over and over again i know no because we just went straight for it oh yeah i know we haven't been back ooh which game of thrones house do we belong to stark (gasps) i told everybody my trinket story oh when they said it was satanic and stuff no oh grog and kima oh greg did it oh with a little porty emote that's cute thanks greg miller that was so awesome was that during the game oh that was before the show that was a good one yeah and we had to bust you out that and percy was an awesome lawyer that's a good question matt i just saw if we all die or if some of us die do we have to roll in at a level one or do we start at a higher level on top of losing a character do we play any other tabletop games i just did that show with wil titansgrave which is a different tabletop rpg and it's really fun i was worried even when we were figuring out the setup of the tables how it was going to work that being far away from each other was going to screw things up but it's just like when we were playing at our house across the table from each other we're also only playing for three hours as opposed to eight i saw a thing asking what was it like shooting the opening credits (all laugh) being in costume for it and everything which is really funny because we did not plan on being in costume like a bracer or carry a weapon we all showed up and were like oh this is cool let's put this on oh nice congratulations didn't you have one made (gasps) that's right it did it saved her life dude scott i was just talking to amanda wyatt today about your concert the other night and i wish i would have been there different one like a pet i dream about our characters isn't that crazy oh i pictured gilmore with black hair oh i like that i pictured him with black slicked-back greasy hair in a ponytail isn't that crazy that it's instantly clarota and it's instantly kima it's not matt anymore as soon as it's that character it makes us so happy awesome i save so many pictures to my phone i have no reason for it but i scroll through it when i'm by myself yeah you find a lot of good stuff liam man you find so much on the internet a different class yeah i think i definitely if i have to re-roll which i don't ever want to have to do but i would want to be a tiefling i know i also like being a human oh that's true you're so good at dwarves i love it or hanging with your friends you don't have to drink and even if it's not people you know very well if you find people that like d&d-- so many people that we've seen online and some of our friends don't have d&d groups and they find a place to go and play d&d and meet those people honestly i didn't know you very well i didn't know orion very well when we started and now all of us are best friends it creates that i know we see each other more than almost anybody else in our lives we've got to get going grog has a session in the morning we love you critters
