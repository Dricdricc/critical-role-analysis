i don't play an orc i play eltariel also known as the blade of galadriel i'm a super cool and i have like daggers and i can kick a lot of butt thanks that's exactly how i recorded it how does he feel about elves that was in the previous-- yeah yeah sure oh hi my name is arburuk i'm the unbreakable because people have tried but nobody was able to actually break me i'm olog-hai so i'm kind of big but you know i don't necessarily want to be a fighter i'm just really good at it you know because i'm unbreakable and all yeah that was two things you're an olog too what's the matter skak they look a lot alike i like gold but i thought barfta ruled this world is that gold it's hoshgrish he's such a bully hey you mess with mozuu you mess with me oh oh oh well he was his drink was disrespected that's all it is sometimes i'm talking to you sometimes but-- yeah sometimes because your helmet blocks the view you know what's he sound like maybe just the top of it he's so good at math i take a helmet off one and put it in my bag isn't that where barfta lives up there and it's on fire because they need to die ditto with my maul oh no what did you get oh no 14 you can call me arby i step in front of skak here to try to block him from any more arrows coming i'm a defender you know i know what those are this is cool matt that's not close at all whoa you're a roguey rogue he gets 3d6 nice going skak i run forward and try to do the same thing to another one oh shit 18 does he stay stunned for a turn but if you hit a guy that's stunned does he become unstunned tight i'm going to run up and hit the guy that he hit between the legs with my maul i hit him like a batter that's a 15 to hit because he's stunned that's a 19 to hit no that's wrong that was a 17 to hit does it still hit yeah okay let's see 12 on the first hit that was artistic is there another guy do you have something else you have to do and there's another guy i can hit oh no that might not 11 it's because i wasn't looking at him i was looking at the beauty on the spike over there that is my armor class oh no i'm going to use my reaction to reduce the damage yeah but can i only do that once oh really okay i'm not going to do that just yet i am going to use troll's endurance because if it's once per short rest then it's okay right yeah i'm going to do it ooh eight plus two so i only take one point of damage they're so strong thanks that's why i'm unbreakable this is why six mine hit the back yours hit the shoulder yeah let's fuck that guy up i'm going to try to hit him and i'm standing next to him barfta well i was thinking i could lead who's that is barfta in there and it's on fire barfta is that you i don't know if that was barfta maybe we should break the door down to see who it is i try to break it down 17 plus eight i get to reroll ones ten plus five 15 can we see where barfta is in here does he look like he's in trouble does he look hurt i'm very perceptive 15 okay i try to break through the rest of the door oh no oh i have really good athletics 12 yeah oh my god i'm so strong oh i step on him but not to kill him to hold him in place can you answer some questions for us please oh no i scream in his face somebody ask him questions is that the truth i start looking around the room and forget that i'm actually standing on him and i put my full weight down oh does that hurt i don't actually like the taste of-- i'll just finish stepping on him you are so good at-- oh counting yes i'm arb-uruk the unbreakable but you can call me arby where are we going again while he's doing that can i walk over to eden and say i got burned a little in the door don't take my skin off though oh that's cool i don't know if they're good or not but i've got some eyeballs i bring out my patch of eyeballs which kind did you need because i got little eyeballs and bigger eyeballs oh that's a piece of lint you're right what-- (yelling and laughing) i'm the chosen one i'm the chosen yeah sono ow but that made my hands hurt worse please all right oh yeah and then i get my troll's endurance back do you have like fancy pins or something we could wear oh you should you should just carve it in because you're a scar-artist my shoulder looks really good you want one on your arm like i got but we got to take a short rest though right while we were getting our tattoos though was that a short rest what's shrak mean again is that a dick okay a gronk is a dick you could ride on my back i could give you a piggyback ride because i think we're too big to ride this scatagorse yeah i don't know are we too big well he has the head on his helmet so he can probably see farther than the rest of us here's a couple they don't match but that's all right upgrade i'm going to take skak and i'm going to sit him on my shoulder you hear those people screaming in the background sam and and torches hey something's down here it's softer i start stomping on it 14 i hate ghouls you had a torch right in your hand i did mention torches but i didn't say i pulled it out 11 do we all have darkvision (sings) how are you at what's your health at i'm going to-- you said they're susceptible to bright light all right i'm going to pull out my torch and i'm going to hold it in the same hand with my maul because i got big hands and then i'm going to swing it oh i have to light no i didn't light it as a bonus action i took it out but i didn't light it yeah and then i'm going to try to hit the ones that were attacking mozuu (laughs) okay yeah i mean that's what torches do (laughter) yeah ooh that's good that's 15 yeah i'm going to attack another one 11 yeah oh i get to reroll that yes 14 so there's two more of them on mozuu there's two more on mozuu i'm going to turn i'm going to use my action surge to hit two more to try to hit them that's 14 i've got to keep that eight five is eight plus five is 12-- 13 no 13 i've got one more attack here ooh that's good that definitely hits 24 ooh 15 yeah you're welcome holy moly don't worry i have a torch well you said it was susceptible-- all right all right i guess i'm going to try to kill these things that were attacking me ooh i thought that was really good but it wasn't it's 18 (cackles) 16 i'm going to look down and try to hit the one that's at my feet that's a natural one eden i thought i was supposed to run but i can't run there's ghouls 13 you asshole i mean you glob i can't really hear anything after that explosion does it know where home is i think we should run away and i start running away as i'm running do i see the little lost ghoul i splat it i want to try to splat it as i'm running 26 14 i keep running can i use-- as my bonus action i'm going to use my second wind they don't want to get lost like some other little ghouls out there it's the dark lord you should probably pick your nose we killed them all of them every last one of them i did is that how many i killed okay do you think we could take them wait but i'm hurt still from the ghouls will you help me (laughter) can we can we rest and watch them while we rest let's sit down for 30 minutes around and maybe heal a little bit but then be ready to attack if they get up no skak yeah well my elbow's been giving me some problems lately because i think the maul might be a little too-- i may be overextending oh well a ghoul bit me on my knee and a ghoul bit my ankle and another one got up here around the shoulder but i can't tell if it's from the scar that skak gave me that's good i was down 15 you have hair gross can we run to the restroom this is so much fun
