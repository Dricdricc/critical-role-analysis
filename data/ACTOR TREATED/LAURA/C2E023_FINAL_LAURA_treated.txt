commercial at all this time i can send a message to the gentleman so we don't have to go back i keep wanting to use this spell that i have but i haven't been able to do it yet it's called sending yeah i can send a message but it's one of my most powerful spells you guys so if we're going to fight somebody i don't know if it's smart it's like a piece of paper of the mind do you want me to do it at the end of the day okay do we want to go find that troll guy so we stay far away this time no you just throw it in the door you don't have to walk in i know that's the thing right we'll send frumpkin

follow the vines along and see where they're coming from yeah do it oh no it's one of those things again just go around it i throw little bits of moldy pastries at it because i feel sorry for it well it's still really good you know we're going to get lost in this swamp forever maybe we circled around for two hours the first time and we just didn't realize it those were the bone chimes should we be stealthy should i cast pass without a trace on us liam and yeah stay within 30 feet of me okay nott bless you now you have advantage on stealth checks yeah let's do a semicircle around where the door is don't attack him up close don't let him get close to us yeah is this rough terrain is this swampy or is this normal ground okay oh that's-- oh no oh no kiri stay behind this tree next to me no behind it yeah who has the boomstick okay be stealthy you have advantage you're going to see if the troll is inside-- what if the troll's not in there though then we can go steal stuff so find out if he's in there maybe he should go in there yeah that's true okay go in there nott do it it has to be within 30 feet so caleb you've got plus ten right now wait can we all hold our attacks for as soon as the troll comes out of the tree okay well sneak back here just use your thing don't you have like burning hands or something just light a finger on fire and just touch the thing yeah you could run and do it oh that's good what why why do you want me to die you're right it will okay i'm gonna follow 30 feet behind nott as we're going up (laughter) i'm going to get within 30 feet of nott and i'm within 30 feet of nott sure i guess oh that's good you still have advantage oh and plus ten but i-- attack attack attack that's only 2d6 of damage oh no if you take so much more-- okay seven he can't he's burned oh no can you not get within close range of him again this is a surprise attack though that's me i'm going to cast spiritual weapon right above it and it's going to hit him it's not at disadvantage because it's melee right ooh that's 1d8 because i did it wrong before that's five plus seven eat it troll then i am going to use my bonus action to ring a spiritual bell and toll the dead yes that's what i mean he's got to make a wisdom save of 15 yeah so that's 2d12 ooh 14 i'm going to stay right there he's looking pretty rough ooh he's so ugly don't laugh yet oh no we can't attack him until you guys move this is not about the gold fjord this is a reckoning oh no how far does it look like the pustules spray throw it at him it's 15 feet away oh no as far as you can get as far as you can roll better than beau from out of the flames comes the spiritual weapon from behind and it's going to come up and spank him on the butt 14 aw man i pop out from behind the tree and say i was aiming for your butt and then i'm going to cast guiding bolt at level three damn it fuck mother bitch no it doesn't hit did you guys see how powerful that was super powerful i'm going to run away i'm going to turn around and run the other direction yep right there no is he grappled it slows him i think oh good wait nobody hit it because fjord's going to take serious damage you'll keep taking damage good one molly and he's poisoned too isn't he what wait are you awake then fjord i'll walk up to fjord and i'll cast cure wounds at level one i'll tap his head and be like wake up already six points kiri come out don't stab the corpse this time it's poisonous i did oh thank god oh my god do you have thunder wave or anything that can push it back still do it just save your attack-- no we all have our actions so hold your attack 'cause i'll pull fjord away wait until i can pull him away ahh no wait wait wait 30 feet go get the shinies before nott you won't whatever now you have used all your movement and you can't pull him away oh five points if you get more than five points he's dead yeah whoa that was really graphic oh are you dead or something ugh i go over and i use another-- --healing spell yay i do cure wounds on him again stop doing this ooh 11 points this time i'm going to take my axe and i'm going to try to cut out his heart just in case very slowly so it doesn't splatter okay 12 i don't want to touch it i'm going to use my fabric and try to get it out like a cloth or something ah does anybody have anything glass or metal put it in there why it squirted poison we can keep it i'm going to sit on the ground i'm going to look through my stuff see if i have anything that can hold it does his body have a pouch on him at all can i search the body 13 hey nott i found some pickled muscle for you the slimy kind man my medicine checks are sucking ten it's probably human i'm going to take the hide he had covering his junk and wrap it around the heart because obviously it can take being splattered by venom i don't want the dong sit by the skulls it's cozy over here whoa you pass out the 26 gold i guess we should go home huh i mean back to the town don't stab the troll it's poisonous it will hurt you i think we're a bad influence on her no don't eat human kiri don't stab humans and don't eat humans okay do what you have to are you okay fjord you died twice oh that's true three whole times i poke his stomach does it feel like there's a hard thing in there can't feel anything past the steel yeah we should probably do that he gets weird when he kills people when he burns them he did it before i don't know if kiri would she'd probably be cool with it let's start walking we did it yeah we were in the bad part of town we can go to the nice part of town i'm going to cast sending yeah yeah yeah i'm going to cast sending and send a message to the gentleman i'm going to say hey mr gentleman we found your safe house we cleared it out of a bunch of fish people don't worry everything's fine now okay we also found a troll in the swamp we killed that too and we also found some crocodiles please respond to this if you need anything let us know okay and your agent out here the guy with the no teeth is dead he interrupted me while i was telling him what we did yeah there was so much more but i think he got the idea we'll get the bonus yeah he seemed like he was doing pretty good when we saw him you know what it might be because i think they decided to charge other people with the crimes and stuff were they still though are they i don't remember horris do you have a lot of diamonds on you maybe some that are worth 300 gold i'm on the lookout okay poisonous troll hearts man i'm glad he's alive i thought he was one of the dead bodies we found at the safe house he went in the apothecary and i take off running i have a troll heart it's full of poison do i roll with advantage because molly is helping 22 we killed a troll do you want to see it i open the leather and place it down (squishy noise) hey there are a lot of aortas and chambers and stuff probably you could buy it and also give us some stuff really strong ones is that regular or stronger than that but i'm more interested in the healing potions take the troll-- what's your name by the way smithe durban no nope i'm taking it with me what a nice guy i did i liked him a lot thanks fjord i saved his life multiple times today yeah i mean he's not that cool or anything i mean you probably wouldn't be interested in him at all do you have any ginger ale or fresh milk she's the sweetest isn't she she's wearing a mask she's not really a bird and i take her oh that's surprising 20 (whispers) it's tusk love that's definitely tusk love sounds good it opens at sunrise so we should be good yeah they're at the docks or something he dropped them off at the place-- the central stables we have to ask where they are we don't have to go back to the other pub don't worry fjord kids huh they're always wandering off they look like a troll took a shit in them she doesn't like us very much does it look like a t with a u with an s with a k with an l-- you got this yasha i have a book you can read yasha i feel like we only need three rooms wait before i go to sleep i want to use my pearl of power and regain a 3rd-level spell and i want to cast sending on my mama and i'm going to say hi mom i got a new spell i want to say thank you for the package you sent me i know that it was really hard for you to do that and i love you so much and i hope everything's okay with you and i got your letter and the ink and i think it's so-- oh no can i respond to it oh no okay i need to tell her i got her package whoa we have to go to that shop molly you have to pay her to do it too i write a valet ticket really fast here you go that's-- yep i do but you might have to go-- we are i'm going to why not oh man we can't just let her go what if i try to get a hold of her parents or something we can't just-- what are we going to do just send her on her way by herself okay she could be like her own gentleman (gasps) i hope so maybe i can talk to her and have her write down exactly what her parents look like or something and i can try to send a message to them they're birds right here what's the gold stuff in there what's the stuff that swirled around when you put it on the table what is that what else i think that sounds like a pretty cool deal wait no beau no he's paying us they help you-- sometimes guys have problems with the (tongue click) and then there's potions that can help with that my mom said i'm going to look around the store before we leave or as we're leaving the store i want to say molly stay inside for a little bit okay and keep talking to the guy okay for just a minute i'm going to use my paint and i'm going to change the sign to the fungal fart (laughter) ooh 20 i can heal that hey you've got our stuff that's not surprising yeza was he the halfling guy aw while everyone's figuring it out-- hupperdook so we'd pass by hupperdook but rexxentrum is the capital we should probably stay clear and go to hupperdook that trent guy tell you what we'll go hupperdook on the way up and then we can do rexxentrum on the way back gnome parties and they live in mushroom houses insight check 13 that's amazing we have a carriage let's stay on the roads like a flea market town it's an outlet outside of town i bet i can get 300 gold worth of diamonds for way less which by the way i want to talk to you guys here's the thing this spell that i have takes diamonds in order to bring you back to life i don't have enough gold to buy all these diamonds for everybody so-- well yeah or if you want to be selfish about it you can buy your own diamonds and then i'll use those for you doesn't matter it's just 300 gold worth of diamonds but they're going to be gone if you die you keep your diamonds on you yeah no you have your own diamond pocket and then when i save you it'll be like-- sounds good to me we just pop out the diamonds we can still keep ruby jewelry and emerald jewelry-- just diamonds what's that about how come he gets to keep his well maybe he can fly i don't know sometimes he's invisible could it be he's flying next to me i don't know could we maybe keep the diamonds while we're going i need to sit next to kiri and i'm going to pull out my sketchbook and i'm going to ask her to write down everything she can think of about her mom and dad and draw a little picture of them because i'm going to try to do sending for her mom and dad that's about how i pictured them so they were going the opposite direction that we are that sucks i take a little paintbrush and i draw a smiley face on the rock they're not dead i like how this is like final fantasy traveling let's roll individual ones oh 17 that would be funny pineapple if you got a thicker cloak it would look real good with it do you buy stuff as well or do you only sell stuff i've got a gator skin super fresh we should probably tan this i leave the tent are we trying to do a covered wagon no keep saying it maybe he'll start rolling better i'm heading back to the cart spreading out the leather hides and making them dry out no it's not it's a ballerina wait should i have asked if kiri was cold do you get cold kiri do you get cold yes or no you get cold oh i run back in and try to get some warm clothes for kiri something really pretty though okay can we see that was impressive 15 do they look like fancy wagons maybe we should ask have you been to hupperdook did you see the mushroom houses damn it no (shouts) where are you going are you safe i look at one of the kids (whispers) are you safe are you good are you safe i don't know i feel like they would've said if they were in danger or something yeah i'm afraid it's like i don't know i just feel like somebody's not safe there okay okay ask what's happening at their home nogvurot oh that's where the people have been getting stolen from people are getting stolen remember oh okay so we can sort of avoid-- we should avoid nogvurot right now after we've already taken care of the stuff so we get paid do we know how much time we have left before our time is up with the gentleman's timeline and we have a month okay this is going to be the hard stuff now her eyes are like the sea (laughs) natural 20 i'm going to invoke duplicity and i'm going to send her out next to molly do you guys have healing potions because you just sent a lot of arrows at nott i mean at this-- i mean-- you know the drill take off your pants and walk away i rolled a one no pants for me they said they wouldn't be bandits anymore but they are bandits yeah don't go working for criminals that's stupid oh then if you're going to do bad things at least work for somebody who's rich and doing bad things don't just steal from people on the road that's stupid only steal from grumpy people you're going to steal his money and he's got medical problems do i have to heal him now don't kill this corpse don't stab this corpse i know but she'll think it is no way that's so terrible i got pants i'm going to add it because i think i already have some bandit pants he knows where their hideout is he's fine he'll be fine he's a bandit what if we put some flowers in his hair so when he wakes up he looks really pretty there's blankets we can take the blankets molly they have a covered wagon or we can take theirs and leave ours we should take the grain for our horses this is not how i pictured it is it mostly gnomes that live in the city does it look like the buildings are teeny 13 (quietly) we should be going to the city i guess we'll ride into the city blushing tankard tavern alliteration hold the elevator it will be fun we are guests here that's what we are we're guests of hupperdook hupperdook yes that one oh man come on i really want to be on it come on man let us get on man it was a firecracker that's all well we could have if this guy he would have listened to us because we are really important people we're the mighty nein we thought the name was funny we might as well be wearing fanny packs all of us like an amazing fanny haversack i'm going to keep an eye on her because i think she's going to try to steal some of our stuff beau you make really bad first impressions too she's basically you are you saying you are crazy i mean you did that in front of everybody are we having an agreement oh i can see that about you is it sooty up here too do you live on a high floor or a low floor less stairs do you build the machines down there this is a party town
