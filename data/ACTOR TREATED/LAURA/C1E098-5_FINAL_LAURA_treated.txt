did it make it we'll find out by the way i saw voting-- there was a poll to see who they thought would win okay i had to test it that was the joe-dice he's making it into the battle that's right wait wait wait were we supposed to make alliances yes what is it do we get to know what it is you already have fate dice you have a fucking deck of many things you have an entire plethora of fate dice enjoy the fate die keyleth or grog this is serious this is serious oh my god i was just looking at the top-view i didn't realize that those are fucking towers (panting) okay six oh god oh with trinket up there look at us spreading out our numbers so wait we can cast things in these six seconds oh my gosh 19 wait a minute here's my question did we see where everybody landed could we see everybody when we came down or did we just see the guy when he said you have six seconds i immediately duck down and cast pass without a trace on myself and trinket it's like a trapped thing this is so hunger games oh shit okay i'm going to cast pass without a trace on me and trinket and i'm going to send him down-- is there a trapdoor or like a stairway around that he can go down he's going to make his way down but i am going to hide at the top here behind one of those-- so my stealth is 30 solid oh shit you're already there and you die that's pretty smart just putting yourself in the ball that's smart you know what and then we can't hurt you oh shit unless somebody can dispel it or something so wait only air can pass through it huhlaura  oh my god marisha marisha i'm so nervous oh oh are there lair actions okay i can see grog as well because i'm assuming his head is above those parapets i have sharpshooter so he does not i'm going to send trinket down trinket's like (confused bear sound) i can't see him he's hidden like from my field of view i'm assuming i can't really see him can i see percy i'm going to still shoot grog yeah i'm going to shoot grog twice once with the blazing bowstring and we're just going to see how that goes aww man 17 so it hits yes oh shit 15 15 plus four lightning damage wait lightning damage is halved okay and then four lightning damage and then five points of fire damage damn it he gets half piercing damage fuck okay i'm going to try it again and that's an 18 14 halved is seven no wait eight because it's 16 points of damage plus four lightning damage plus blazing bowstring seven points of fire damage and i'm going to use my bonus action i'm going to move down a couple parapets towards you and i'm going to keep hiding as my bonus action do i have to roll if i've got skirmisher stealth or do i just continue to hide i'm just wondering how that works i know i don't remember yeah it's a ranger thing oh so i could say i'm keeping hidden from percy and then i would roll for stealth to hide from everybody else i'm going to keep hidden from percy for skirmisher stealth and then i'm going to roll for stealth and i got a 24 to hide from everybody else yeah is this tee-time that's what earthbreaker groon had i like the idea of seeing tary like oh fuck is there loot and i'm up top fuck i do have a beacon i have a feeling that beacon is going to attack us ooh with the roof on there and everything are you celebrating that i'm getting hurt you dick 24 all right yeah okay okay who can i see okay trinket's going to run up to tary and push him back in the water (laughing) just gentle enough to put him right in the middle 16 well then i'll tell you what was that an attack for trinket okay then i'm going to save my action until somebody outside of tary or doty becomes visible the minute i see his head 17 11 halved plus three lightning damage oh because you're enlarged all right ooh that next one is good that definitely hits and then 16 17 19 halved because he's not by anybody is he okay down and dirty can totally see your head outside of the-- yeah i can from where i am i can see your head aww you terrible person aww buddy wait how many damage was that 34 i'm going to say 34 oh doty or is it just what we had on our body yeah we aren't but yeah that's true grog always has a bunch don't none of us do anything if we don't do anything for a minute tary's weak it's a mimic okay grog's coming for me first of all trinket's going to just wade out into that water to get no longer on fire damn it it's acid or something what is it no trinket goes ow ow and then he comes back out trinket i didn't even tell you to do that you just did that on your own and then-- yeah you know and then i'm going to get on my broom-- what's a whale i get on my broom and i want to fly up and over above grog actually could i actually get to grog if i was flying i couldn't get down to him though oh this is going to be the worst move ever if it doesn't work i'm going to get down to where grog is this is so stupid though no because if it doesn't work i can't get away because that's all my movement isn't it you want to team up i go down to grog and i say let's shake on it but i take my necklace off and i put it into my hand taliesin and oh it's a one whatever i still try to touch it to him whatever he doesn't do it it's a wisdom saving throw it's only a ten you can't unless i release you hey man my mind's already there yes i plan on it believe me i'm going to use my bonus action to stay hidden from for my skirmisher stealth can i pick a target i want to stay hidden from keyleth great so i can't use my bonus action to hide because she's right there tight i'm going to then use my skirmisher to stay hidden from percy and i've got nothing i can do he could bust out of the necklace does that mean if i put an actual monster inside of it during the game that they could break out and he's designed to not think i'm so dead you guys he's going to pop out oh no that could be really bad oh shit what if you get sucked into a random void then we can never defeat you oh god he's out i was going to release you not with sharpshooter i think if they're prone we don't take disadvantage right no i glare at percy from under grog's armpit i'm going to put myself out i'm going to disengage yes and i'm going to kick off the ground and fly up as high as i can i want to be over the roof of the building below me you are so cruel 16 i have a feeling this going to kill him oh and i don't have the necklace anymore or unconscious 21 points is what he had trinket is unconscious is there room for that how big is that damn orb you can fit it up inside there i really hope the fire pillar goes off yeah but you've got a hole in it wait you have four attacks oh welp i can see percy so i'm going to hunter's mark him and then i'm going to attack him this first attack well let's see oh yeah that hits yeah that definitely hits 31 and it's a bramble shot so you have to roll a strength dc for the regular oh right okay wait that's an additional 4d8 (adding) 38 plus six lightning damage you're so strong darling i'm so impressed right as i throw another arrow at him (laughter) i'm going to do another no i'm not i'm not going to do a bramble shot on him i'm just going to do a regular shot well yeah he's taking half damage oh wait do you only get to use the catch once 12 14 16 plus six lightning damage fuck okay those are my two attacks so can i fly down to the ground behind the building actually they're all over on the other side i'm going to drop down where i am yeah to the roof and i'm going to lay down on the roof and use my bonus action to hide 27 this is the sixth round this is the fifth round after this will be the sixth it's smart (laughter) i'm going to take off from the roof and try to make it to the opposite tower yeah can i see anything 20 well then i'll try to hit her i'm going to attack her that's a 27 matt and eight plus five is-- no is it no 13 15 plus four lightning damage and then i'm going to do it again i'm going to do a bramble shot on her because i only did the one 25 to hit (counting) 32 plus three lightning damage yeah i figured i bet tary's up here but i don't know that i'm going to use my bonus action to hide i was hidden at the beginning of the turn but i'm assuming my movement took me out of hiding can i use my skirmisher's stealth to choose a quarry to stay hidden or i have to be hidden at the top of the turn okay i'm going to hide only 18 oh i forgot he's just unconscious he's not dead yet i haven't been making saving throws for him we have earrings dear (laughter) do i hear tary go (yelps) anywhere oh my god 20 how many 10d10 matt and all right he knows where but nobody else does motherfuck oh that's great that definitely saves 30 okay (groans) but i can't see her i can't see anybody from where i am there's nowhere for us to hide no i know it's ground hiding i'm going to fly up towards you matthew yes and i'm going to hover right there wait can i see keyleth okay but three-quarters and i can still attack her okay i'm going to attack her she's in that building i want to be low enough that at the end of my movement i can drop down to the ground i mean drop down to the roof yeah (laughing) yeah that works too she's still hunter's marked from before isn't she i hunter's marked percy then i'm going to move my hunter's mark to keyleth oh wait that's a bonus action just to move it okay then never mind i'm not going to do that it probably is i'm not going to do it 26 to hit okay no 16 plus five lightning damage and i'm going to hit her again and the second attack is 30 16 plus four lightning damage and then for my bonus action i'm going to cast-- oh wait can i do that no it's not shitballs i was thinking i had a potion but i don't and i can't cast a cure wounds that's an action and i can't retrograde a hex on her so i'm going to try to hide again because that's the only bonus i can do right now i'm going to drop down to the ground i don't have any movement i used all my movement just to get there tight because there's no such thing as fire storm which just fucking destroyed me no such thing maybe i'll roll a natural 20 and then she'll just not know that i dropped down i rolled a natural 20 does it matter at all that i rolled a natural 20 i have to pee so bad no what if i die 25 well that's good what did you just do okay sphill the flaming sphill is what she said and that is what it forever will be called oh i only called a giant fire storm if i flew up to the top of the tower nobody would see me that i know right right now okay then i'm going to fly up to the top of the tower by me but i'm going to be at the back i'm going to step away from the edge so that people on the ground can't see me yeah okay and i'm going to use my action to cast cure wounds at 3rd level which is 3d8 15 plus my spellcasting modifier which is 18 points so i heal 18 points of health and then i'm going to use my bonus action oh okay i can't go down there before i moved can i have cast hunter's mark on keyleth for my bonus i still don't have visual do i have visual on her now can i say i moved up cast hunter's mark on her and then backed off okay and that's it the chest wasn't on fire and the potion wasn't destroyed (laughing) you're still burning no i love it he is loving that fire seriously just a bystander this whole fight but all the acid pours up and out doesn't it displacement does trinket get hit by the acid but doty does too right but just in case keyleth doesn't care about animals apparently only plants i heard grog yell empty i know where grog is i'm going to step over and attack him oh yeah 30 okay yeah 12 plus two lightning damage and then the second one definitely hits 16 plus one lightning damage and for my bonus action i'm going to-- oh god no no he can get up to me i'm going to get on my broom and i'm going to fly up i'm going to fly into the air for my movement i don't want to fly up i want to fly over i want to fly away from grog no towards the other brazier yeah okay i'm going to do that oh god you know what ooh this could be real bad nope i'm not i'm thinking about it i'm going to fly i'm going to be up but i'm going to stay over the roof this is still stupid i'm going to die grog's going to kill me but further over towards-- i want to hover over the roof but towards the other brazier sorry i got confused matt i thought that's where you were saying i was okay hi grog (laughter) oh it hits me doesn't oh shit (laughter) oh 34 to hit oh god oh dear lord oh no i think my math is wrong hold on hold on that doesn't make sense 25 you say oh no i just dropped unconscious (laughter) yeah i'm sure kill me quickly so i can go pee because i've had to for an hour now come on oh are you immune to acid damage what is he at then oh okay she basically pooped that's what it sounded like she did i know right i mean come on that would've been the absolute best thing to do damn i wish my thing wasn't busted i would put him in the-- save he has the actual matt oh we have t-shirts we have gilmore's glorious goods we have vox machina t-shirts we have how do you want to do this t-shirts you never know no it's in a couple weeks right is that enough time to plan anything two weeks from now we could throw something together right oh my god it's going to be a grim reaper that comes out and kills grog immediately can i okay okay what is ruin it looks terrible what does that one do oh it looks good it looks like a good one intelligence is this a good one too it looks good i hope i've cursed him please let me have cursed him five is a lot five is as high as you can count oh no this looks good too does he get a wish please be on top of the tower on a horse can you move can you move is that a 20 what do you want he's not dead that's a failed death save for me that's two fails well all right one no fate dice for us percy have you been adding your wisdom modifier this whole time plus one run away plane shift was her 7th-level spell tary will be the survivor because he's hiding why couldn't he have rolled like he did on the one-shot where it was one after one after one he got another 20 what did you get no he's just resistant so poison acid he's not resistant to oh he's not resistant to acid had to bring him back didn't you i like that we thought this might go fast he's got a lot he had a lot of hit points tary not impossible tary it's not impossible wait you can't cast 3rd-level spells after you've already done a spell you can only do 2nd-level if he knocks you off your broom did he get knocked off his broom he doesn't have the same things that i have oh shit don't kill him tary he has to roll a natural 20 in order to get this no he has to roll a 19 oh a saving throw oh shit it's not even that much it's a 13 or higher oh my god and your parents are named after tony stark's parents how crazy is that oh man that was awesome you did have places that people that were flying could hide i had no idea you could break out of my fucking necklace well you don't know that because it was all a dream in tary's fucking head you did go down hard all of your war paint is gone no he's just been wiping his face the whole night it's all over his hands probably no don't i mean how
