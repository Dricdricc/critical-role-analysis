no more of you doing my voice matt what no but it's free glory be to grog wait i'm coughing tonight a lot so if i do everybody just stop and stare at me so if i get up and leave that's what happened i don't want to have a coughing fit on screen or i pooped my pants yeah sorry i just wanted to put that out there wait what just kidding i was watching (quietly) they killed him nonagon i remember that fjord asked me to be in his boat yeah nonagon (singing) na na na-na yeah our ship is so colorful although i think probably fjord i should be the one paddling the boat because i'm a bit stronger than you okay no i just-- no i'm glad i'm back oh gosh are we going to fight undead things what is going on this is just like that scene in tusk love the scene where the ship is sinking and oskar and genevieve have to paddle to shore guinevere that's was it was i remember oskar a little more only oskar was paddling in that one it is should one of us go in one and one of us go in the other should we go in the bow or the stern can we feel more wind coming from either side wind 21 you should row backwards too yasha i think left should i follow them okay so you'd be fucked (gasps) it's just like the rug oh my god i rolled a one too (cheering) oh cool i like the cat just like blah we rolled real bad five you don't have any initiative okay so you rolled a three good job zwei sam taliesin it looks like no i'm seeing your angle oh my glasses are in my car shit oh it's like hunter's mark wait another one came down on fjord oh no it's going to make us blind too we got to kill it quick it looks like he was being born i can't see anything on the other side yeah i mean i will move the boat closer up oh that was terrible six i can't move the boat y'all okay does that count as an action or a movement cool thanks this is fun guys all right then i'm going to save-- yeah that's what i got i guess yeah sweet did you hear a splash oh no oh that's not a rock things are looking up you guys leap for it because it's a ranged attack skip off the ground earth elementals (screaming) oh my god oh gosh well i hate to use my action to do anything else but i should probably try to get away from the thing that's on the shore huh i'm going to action row strength check that's a good one that's just jester's strength that's a 22 i'm going to use my bonus action to turn around and go eat shit rock face oh god it's pitch dark it got eaten by the darkness we crash into each other and get stuck ah let me go i think those things are going to get us i know actually i'm feeling a little guilty for calling him-- what if he just wanted to be friends i'm trying (squeals) yeah we're rowing backwards slowly should we park the boats can we have some light a little less blue can we clear out these rocks but we're right here (grunting) well that's totally cocked that was terrible athletics 13 ooh hey caleb look don't you want to steal that it's probably magic would you want to go up it's a couple flights up though you said let's go down usually scarier things are down yeah so nott in front i guess i can be after yasha okay are we free of traps in this little-- okay should we send frumpkin down there and see if it's clear oh yeah cats can see the rules need to be changed why don't you send your little dancing lights down there with him what if i just send something that's on fire and i throw it down the tunnel really oh it's resetting we're just seeing you you're really close to us aren't you can you disarm the traps so you don't keep just setting them off a button are there any more oh no is this going to be a puzzle oh fuck me no i'm going to run you can do it it's okay nott i pat your head you know it's a lot of stress you're learning still then the log coming down we're at burning man aren't we we're at burning man that thing's going to try to kill us oh wow it's big what skills you got what this is intricate are all those facing towards fjord on the ground just on the ground yeah take your time are the symbols just painted on the ground or are they carved into the ground they're on the ceiling does that mean we have to cast some spells or something i wonder if you have to stick something in the hole and twist it stick your wang in it oh because of the thing in the middle does the pillar coming out of the ceiling have a hole in it as well i am really good at finding holes yeah 20 but the hole is-- yeah the hole is-- i open up my sketchbook and i start drawing the symbols here look i made this beautiful picture well i'm really talented cantrip no (snickers) i'm sorry oh i can help you you want me to heal you i'm going to cast cure wounds yes i did it on you too so that's seven points of healing for you does that help yeah i'll looking for will-o'-wisps yes that's real good seven deadless marisha and does that look like that shape how big do you want me to throw something up at the vase and try to knock it over i'm going to get down on the ground ayyyy there's a rod where are the faces on the ground yeah whoa should i stick something in these eyes don't break it wait do you double it because it's a critical i was wherever those bodies where because i was kneeling down and looking at them it look like lightning corn on the cob oh no it's like never ending it's not a surprise at least 12 these are the will-o'-wisps aren't will-o'-wisps like kids aren't they the spirits of children that's what i learned in quest for glory shadows of darkness 15 didn't hit them okay as a bonus action i'm going to cast sanctuary on nott it doesn't say concentration it doesn't have that on the-- they have to make a wisdom save if they attack her then as an action i'm going to use my cantrip of sacred flame the one next to molly no it's a dex save it definitely saves she rolled six i should have thrown something at the vase those guys were so stupid they could have broken the vases how dumb are they you want me to try to heal you i'll try to heal you i'm going to cast at a 2nd-level cure wounds because nott seems like she's dying goddamn it really one and a two matt and i could've cast it at 1st-level damn it you still only got fucking seven points of fucking healing goddamn it i just wasted one of my 2nd-levels y'all which room let's take the piece of metal down wait does each of the urns have a different one oh yeah charred fjord do you see anything cool down there does anybody have weapons or coins on them we'll get you out just look for something cool though what kind you can ask nicely everybody else was resting up top while-- it's okay because i don't get my spells back with rests so that's really good that i used it and everything yeah she needs better organization you got to divide them out i think the corkscrew's going to stick in the hole and move the whole room or something we can try to move some of the rubble do we know which way we're turning everything now travis taliesin and oh everybody knows it already but why did you decide the way that you're saying it yeah i like the way you guys think that sounds smart so that's evocation you guys and divination and necromancy maybe it's got to be a real person maybe you have to cast a spell that has to do with the class of magic cast a spell on one of the bowls (angrily) no it's fine i don't know i could inflict wounds on it or something or toll the dead on the bowl well no i'm going to use a cantrip because it's better so i'm going to toll the dead on-- necrotic divination and evocation so i'll try to toll the dead on one of the bowls the one that is sitting on the diamond wait is it turning yeah see this is why i shouldn't have used my spell that wasn't a dick joke 20 i don't know how do you fight a gelatinous cube i know but i don't know how to defeat them can it by magic maybe how long does the spell last i'm going to back up away from it i'm going to use the sacred flame cantrip because i figure it's not very dextrous it's a 1d8 radiant damage six did it look like it did anything to it okay yes is there something in it back away from it what if a tentacle comes out of it or something there's no harm in raging assault it advantage she has advantage because-- it's a cube did she get-- oh nevermind no it's more than that here's ten plus five 15 22 stupid cube oh no is she poisoned i know right high-level rogue was still pretty cool oh no it breaks free beau's right next to it it's going to slurp you half of its movement oh no who's it going for no oh man and it's right next to me now oh god okay ooh i'm going to cast toll the dead on it it's a wisdom save also 14 balls okay okay then i guess i'm going to (singing) try to back away from it towards fjord a little further if i can please because it probably can't move very far bitch of a fucking marshmallow i'm out i'm unconscious i was yeah if i die tonight when i decided to come and play even though i'm coughing-- i'm going to die you guys when does the cube go oh oskar thank you for saving me sorry i mean fjord yes oh did we kill it sorry i think that was my fault you guys who has divination though does anybody have one of those can your mage hand lift you up wait i have an idea maybe we should take the bowls outside of the room and cast something on the bowls and see if one of the symbols on the bowls light up that way the staff doesn't absorb the spell immediately because when i cast toll the dead i was trying to cast it on the bowl right but instead my spell went up into the middle of the staff maybe if we try casting it on the bowls outside of the room that won't happen just so we don't have to fight another cube just in case how many points of healing did you give me when you poured the spell in my mouth i'm feeling like i'm a little sick right now but you know i'm feel like i've got very little health like i'm bleeding a little bit from my ears caleb i have healing spells still it's okay i wasn't bitching at all you asked let's fucking go out into this hallway okay should we try casting a spell on one of the bowls and see what happens no we don't i don't think so because we're not in the room anymore so we can try to see if the bowls do anything i'm going to cast my spare the dying cantrip necromancy wait i blow on the bowl does it look like any of the symbols got any brighter do we need to set these on fire you need three spells we need to set it on fire hold the torch under one of the bowls just hold it under and see what happens hold the torch under one of them for a long time and see what happens woah here we go we were wrong about what we needed to cast that's that one what is this illusion we need an illusion transmutation-- i have an enchantment i can transmute or something i think so we don't even need the bowls wait i got to find my spell that actually does the thing that i said i could do wait i have enchantment enchantment i have enchantment okay i'll go stand by the enchantment-- under the symbol for enchantment just in case can you do enchantment i think we're casting it at the staff do we need to be standing in front of the symbol that it lines up with i'll go stand in front of the three dots we count to three and we go i'm doing hold person hold person oh man that's good because who knows what else we'll run into while we're down here you should detect traps beau should i use my last spell to heal myself so i should cast the spell on myself this seems like a waste of money i'm trying to be smarter with my money be careful i'm hanging out with caleb and beau the will-o'-wisps are we in the other room still or did we come in can i look around the room we're in the room let's go ooh i'll climb up on the bookshelf does it look trapped is this trapped on the wall climb up on the bookshelf with me should i try to pull it out i lift i pull and i try to pull it off the wall good job not getting stabbed you guys because this is sharp-looking this is a sacrificial blade for sure i'm holding it it's pretty girthy can you identify it i'll strap it to my back it's very sharp and the bag is easily punctured and i don't want to risk it i'll strap it to my back ooh why the thing is he probably won't ever tell us say it all out loud what but then this sword belongs to the guy who came to save siff the bounty hunter what was the thing about fire or ice though it was like fire or ice hold what still i'm good i don't have hardly any hit points i've got a 2nd-level and a 1st-level we should probably run was he coming up out of the teleportation circle we could run away bring the book and run away this guy is way beyond our level
