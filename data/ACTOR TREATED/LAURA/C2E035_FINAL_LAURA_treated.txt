are we going to kill him well if we don't how do we get away without anyone knowing that we killed his guards and we let the guy go what if he goes in to like a protection service or something that's true i mean we weren't even going to attack if he hadn't attacked us in the first place i don't want him to get revenge on my mother can we make it seem like algar was the one who did all this like maybe he turned-- no well because i heard tracy say that she was staying at the fancy-- the lavish chateau oh good call what if we send him out to sea don't necessarily kill him but make him leave and then make it seem like he was the one that did everything worst case scenario we kill him oh okay yes i will disguise myself as a tortle but not the that guy we met like a tortle that's a girl no no hair but like a skirt because girls wear skirts obviously that's what girls do you could do a prayer of healing oh really we could both do prayers of healing i'm going to say i'm doing it too but i'm not really going to dear traveler please heal everyone do you guys feel better you're welcome does he have any pretty buttons that's good hobbies woo ruby she's real hot (laughter) oh man you're going to be in so much trouble what do we do with him so nobody sees him hey yasha what's in your bag you've been carrying okay i mean (southern accent) oh all right (whispering) shit i forgot to do the voice how do you remember to do that all the time i'm going to pull out my disguise kit and give him a nice little beard and a mustache and an eye patch i'm proficient with disguise so i roll with

spending cash make sure he's not completely destitute when he gets there he was a bad person we didn't kill him i need to write a letter about-- okay what should i say i hate this city i want everyone to suffer what i feel in my heart i'm sick of all you people pushing me around i'm freeing this djinn and i'm setting sail for another land how about all of that that's probably good okay well what if i just write ha ha ha i'm so glad you guys are going to suffer i got away scot free if the djinn got away then maybe the djinn did it unless you're high enough level and then it (pop) so i'm writing this letter and i'm leaving it in his office yeah what do we have two channel divinities or just one at this level then i turn undead oh that's true what do you guys think okay deuce has a really good idea maybe instead of we say go fuck yourself and all of that what if we say-- it's really strong we have this version of his letter right here draft number two oh no i lost control of the genie and now i am so scared i'm running away ah i can't do anything i try to attack it i'll sacred flame him oh that's 11 11 radiant damage oh it's not i like it better when he's saying fuck yourself i think we should stick with the go-fuck-yourself version and say i intentionally-- he intentionally let him go and he knew that he was going to fuck over the city and run okay sincerely-- i'm leaving it in the office fjord choke upon your woe or eat fecal matter question mark signed algar (laughter) with proficiency oh yeah i do i do i focus depending on how i roll i can roll again ooh that's dexterity

why did you roll why didn't you roll seriously i don't even know that's happening sam and great i'm going to use my duplicate to run forward i'm going to use my pearl of power to cast my last remaining 3rd-level spell and i'm going to cast charm person on the three of the guards that i can see yeah sure okay yeah that's good for an hour it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until your companions do anything harmful to it when the spell ends-- it doesn't say anything about it not being in combat oh okay it doesn't say that on the thingy sorry 15 okay i guess i'm going to stay hidden on my end and try to make my way down i can't do anything below but okay whatever yeah yeah i guess i'm going to try to go-- no because i'm going to keep visual on duplicate jester i'm going to stay hidden on the top don't hit those guys in the front the guy that targeted beau has to make a wisdom saving throw no he just fails if on a fail-- it just looks like me though can you lower yourself you're pretty tall taliesin can i climb down instead of jumping can she help try to get the ship to move more don't do it you only have one hit point no you don't fjord don't do that oh god are we going to sink i'm going to pull out my axe the duplicate and i'm going to act like she hits herself with it-- so stupid-- and go (dying noise) and falls into the water she's going to be floating in the water and then i'm going to go-- then i'm going to for my action as jester go and try to hold the door shut for the under-- but i'm crawling i don't want them to see me are you

what did i say 21 half of that 11 whose turn is it to get him up fjord needs healing prayer i go to the back of the boat to see the name of the boat okay can i hit back because i-- okay then yeah i'm going to-- i get two attacks don't i no i just get one attack i'm not going to instead of killing him i'm going to say you probably don't want to attack me we've got a boat full of people we just took your ship you should put down your weapon yeah intimidation 13 what they're right here look behind me you stupid okay okay okay no it's straight because you cast honestly i think we did a pretty good job after everything we got a ship i'm going like ow ow ow he just ran back down okay yeah no it has to be my handaxe yeah that definitely hits 25 ten points of damage i think i'm going to use my cantrip spare the dying and make sure he doesn't die die does he die die i didn't want to kill him like that wasn't my goal but i didn't say that out loud sorry it really wasn't my intention to do that i was aiming for his shoulder and i missed and hit his head (sing-song) you can never go back widow's embrace the mist (gasp) do you happen to know where those business contacts came from these people do you know the guy we just killed there's also maps downstairs i don't know that he knows that never mind what's the name of her ship she's a pirate ooh that's the money he was going to return that's what he got paid we're probably not going to kill you you'll find out soon enough i mean we already said ionos take the thing off we didn't know that already we didn't know she was the captain we didn't know what her ship was about let's go downstairs maybe we can find something useful i'll follow him i think it was fun honestly i think it was terrible but it was cool think about when we got our flying carpet like we didn't mean to get the flying carpet we ended up bringing the entire tower down upon ourselves right who knows yay well think about nobody that saw us in the city saw us taking the boat lived to tell the tale just kidding all of the guards right there did
