tonight is the last night and then it's gone forever yes you did every time i saw you were wearing it your parents are critters yeah that box is hers yeah it's pretty remarkable yeah otherwise we'd all smell like grog diss oh my gosh it's so pretty the panels behind us i was just admiring-- i think we need to head back to emon we have all of the documents that you took from the briarwoods' stuff plus we have-- the new rulers yeah well we've got percival he's kind of in charge let's do that that's right they can't very well arrest percival when he's royalty now well now he's rich royalty 50000 gold flying carpet gold plus all of the documents that you found okay maybe we can wait until we get back to emon and have gilmore do it oh we can't really ask allura to do it we stole the carpet from her in the first place that would be a very bad move i think but then what we wouldn't get it back maybe she was keeping it secret keeping it safe plus we had them send word to uriel remember we had them send a letter to uriel explaining all the wonderful things we did yes i talked to him so we're heading back to emon but we did send a letter ahead and remember i said make sure to tell them how vox machina saved the day and how wonderful we are and you said yes you would do that i also think i probably sent a letter to pike to let her know that we're safe and we survived everything and that she would've been at winter's crest they've got to right they have horses here no they don't have one yeah walk us through an oak tree we're left behind sealed so it looks like we didn't tamper with it isn't allura on her way here aren't a lot of people on their way here i'm so confused and drez vina right he's coming too he's had a notice to him not drez vina no i take notes i'm going to find his name don't you guys worry then i'm going to bring it right up let's hop in a tree we'll head home we'll send our butler yes they'll be very wonderful to him i can't find it oh no eskil ryndarien was the one i was thinking of he looks good yeah we should go soon though right pike i thought you were in vasselheim so you've been scrying to us the whole time from here why didn't you say anything have you seen the prisoner here hello what was that heading out i go up and hug him and say what would you like us to tell uriel i know they are wanting you in court of course of course not darling i stay and walk around his room a little bit i come down the stairs at this point yeah why is he still in that cell (singing) his name was lola-- desmond desmond desmond desmond i had it right here right there desmond it's beautiful and growing desmond dear before you do could we ask a small favor of you would you mind speaking on our behalf to emperor uriel emperor sovereign uriel that'd be great that'd just be wonderful thank you and you can you know come out of the cell and eat with us now oh right now sure let's go then good to see you too eggs baked beans-- are there days of the week what is a weekend oh we were just saying how well you look pike no pike didn't know he was here no it's fine oh no i thought desmond was like a teenager is he how young is he can you grow back his digits how about we don't talk about this in front of other people i think that is a beautiful beautiful gesture no i mean you grew one of liam's vax's toes back that's beautiful -- 20 that's awesome and it doesn't hurt anymore stop telling him what to give him yes see and that way dear brother he won't be on the road with lots of gold in his pocket to get stolen that's why we have that fabulous crystal long time ago oh god wait can i just ask because we had three days and i didn't check on it i had that jewelry box that we stole from the tylieri house i didn't ever look in it because we just took it and set it aside and i have this whole thing of jewelry and i also have a bloody bag of gold and a bag of gems that i never checked in on all right awesome and then the jewelry box is any of it you know magical i'm keeping the jewelry box 'cause i want it and i'll add the 150 to our party funds because i'm generous all right yeah let's go to court scanlan had them oh wait wait did we send anybody ahead with our letters yeah he's you know potentially we did leave town all right we'll just follow behind him and stay at a distance i can read lips what do they say ooh yeah yeah he was under their control i think man i need to organize my notes better got it all written down somewhere wait what are you doing i'll step up behind you i follow suit plus they may be able to enchant your crown so it has some you know special mind-control fighting abilities just you know throwing out some ideas that's all are you looking for something specific oh yes actually that is something we discovered on our own oh that's right i guess we don't need him to testify-- especially not against harpies probably not lute-playing i'm gonna just throw that out there i walk rocks hand him on the back of his arm just like that of course i would right now but i don't have any on me how crazy is that hide it around put some in your shorts put some in your shoes-- uriel we'll leave you to your business but if you need any help finding anyone we're here for you of course better than i expected to be sure the dickhead that built our frigging keep yeah i mean he's built-- he's built a lot but i assume he's probably built secret entrances into different places can i search his room are we allowed to do that i mean he did ask-- so you can gain better control anyway i want to go check out his room why would gilmore know he's just staring at you council members coming through i'm gonna perception check the whole room to see-- 23 for me in a teleportation circle oh the glyphs i saw them at the ziggurat keyleth pike do you know anything about-- is this like an anti-scrying glyph set why do we need to shake him down hey do you know the last time-- who the last person was that saw this gentleman what was the servant's name the guard just keeps notes good cop bad cop lost okay oh my god you're gonna kill him jeez louise trinket goes up and licks his face we should go check out this tavern then yeah and maybe go to the bathroom there what a good idea good idea he's at the tavern right i mean oh my gosh 42 smugglers there's a tavern really are you sure where at the tavern we busted in there oh shit i think it's a perfect time to take a break and then-- somebody needs to go to the bathroom what what's wrong with your stupid foot what's that sound is somebody popping popcorn you have two extra cloaks you gave me one and then you have another one no no no do your shit scanlan we'll just look around i keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't-- any of us nice haul samson we are (laughs) you can call us the shits scanlan's a kingslayer (laughs) are you leaning on something doctor doctor we're quite skilled but we have a bit of a name for ourselves as well i'm afraid we may not be able to help you out he didn't say his name what district does he live in wow that's a good insight check secrets secrets pillaged pretty sure it's already been cleaned out unless you're hearing things we don't know about all right how long have you been here hmm have you noticed-- i'm sure you've seen many people come in and out but an older gentleman dressed much nicer than he should be in an establishment like this a few days ago did he yes did you see where he went really are there rooms here yeah i get up and leave the table and go talk to the barkeep i'm going to talk to the barkeep and talk about rooms potentially first just seeing what they have available and what's being rented right now hi you have rooms yes do you have an older gentleman elven battle scars-- i describe him-- staying here right now insight-check her that's okay 23 yeah so many people come in and out it would be so easy to lose sight of somebody like that who came in i put five gold pieces onto the countertop it sure would be wonderful if you could remember anything about him being here however completely understandable thank you for your time scanlan could you have your wonderful friends create a distraction just enough so we can slip unnoticed downstairs all right we've been here we've barged in here before well why do we have to-- why is it dangerous why can't we just go in and ask for him and get him aren't you still-- i look at your hand-- don't you have the mark i mean that's what i mean i've seen it you guys where are you i put my hood up before i head back that way (quietly) oh no oh i get advantage yeah 25 you called the kitchen staff out oh and trinket 16 is that bad what else-- oh shit i hear it i come out of the kitchen very sneakily oh oh my bear i've been looking everywhere for you trinket what are you doing in this tavern oh dear we should probably head outside you and me trinket fuck i tell him-- oh oh no that's so sad but i tell him to head back to the keep i guess to the keep 'cause what else he can't just hang out without us there really oh deception deception i lead trinket outside and i see them come out the alleyway okay yeah so i have trinket hang out in the alley and stay there and wait for us be safe trinket if any danger comes your way intimidate them and run the other direction go home i love you you guys are evil for making me leave him no just me i got 18 18 come on scanlan you totally let her win and you're going to give her all your money do not give her your money do you take any of the gold out secretly before you hand it over to her oh god do you want to cry because i would want to cry fuck yeah man me it's so pretty you speak the same languages as me oh i also speak undercommon what about draconic but that's okay pike can read dwarvish you have a negative two modifier (laughs) don't you know goblin scanlan so wait the top one is a yes the middle one is a yes the bottom one is a yes we don't know yes they all say enter entry did you check for traps natural 20 balls natural 20 yes and don't-- how about you don't unlock those ones i'm walking away try the ones that aren't trapped first please do the middle one try pushing the door do whatever you want to do try disarming them sure why not do your thing good job good job brother do i see any tracks that look like they could have been from an elf an old guy with some battle scars 21 i would have had to roll a 20 i bet just take your shirt off show it to the world i'm gonna cast pass without a trace on all of us not necessarily i just cast pass without a trace yeah we're down here obviously we belong beautiful let's do it i've got no flying i used my only flying potion not a soul we didn't exactly break in we just kind of-- i'm just shutting up where's he going uriel has a lot of gold and will probably give a reward but scanlan you said we were going to keep that for ourselves no can i help him can i assist that oh well ah damn it that's all we need we'll leave it outside the door he was going for it whoa i think it opens a portal to another plane did you give him the password i think we were saying the password made it work i think he knows it's super powerful magic anyway and he doesn't give a shit and he's taking it anyway can you wall of stone the other side of the hallway just to block them from coming down that hallway again can you block wall of stone that other side i thought the one he left through into his cell he just completely took an expensive thing and left us to rot pretty much i think i'll go down with scanlan on the other one so i can ranged attack-- i'm gonna stand with my back against the wall that she's built up like that yeah yeah 26 isn't he old i call out daxio don't be a moron step outside and lower your weapon you're surrounded my deep voice to intimidate him more 13 should i walk forward or should i keep-- i mean as far as we know sam why don't you check the other door yeah i'm just going to-- i'm going to stay where i am i guess oh can i have used my bonus action to hide natural 20 i don't know what you can do can we take his weapon from him since he can't move do it pike that's good oh wait it might be higher than that no all right i guess i walk-- look at us all bunched up in this little hall i'm going to stay where i am and i'm going to just call out you're being really stupid obviously you are outnumbered you are frozen you should probably just you know give up okay until grog i want to hold my action until grog gets him to move until he moves out of-- do i have to say what i'm going to-- i want to if anything attacks us i want to be able to attack it don't you wish we had trinket now can we move his muscles or is he frozen can we handcuff him while he's frozen weren't you holding your turn until grog moved him oh right sneak attack you just get the additional six remember and then add your six (gasps) it may help commune with nature come on roll so high this guy sucks no brother come on what are you gonna do how long does the spiritual weapon last me okay oh no should i go in the room i feel like i don't want to i just okay you know what i'm gonna hunter's mark him seriously well then fuck it i'm gonna just stay where i am i'm gonna keep point i'm gonna stay at the back of the hallway just in case again still hiding you don't double it who's gonna tie him up who's in the fucking room and pull him out of the room anyone can i toss grog my-- some of the infinite rope and tell him to tie him up tie up his ankles too yeah but he's got his ankles tied up he wouldn't be able to get a firm grip on the swing it'd be like (gasps) with the new weapon wait wait keep him alive are you talking about dres-- vecna are you talking about vecna oh that's a yes let's get this fucker out of here that's true he had a lot of money with him i'm gonna hang out by the door i'm gonna let him hang out i'm sure you do but you lost yours so i'm gonna hold on to it for you i take it no we're not we're going to leave through the alley where trinket is waiting we can toss him over trinket's back we just walk on out hey
