but these would be umbrasyl scales this way we can make umbrasyl black dragon armor yeah yeah yeah but we could make dragonhide-- with dragonhide you could make badass armor right oh oh i thought it was infinite well okay i'm definitely doing that while they're working on the dragon oh man come on 20 does this have to do with dragons is it an investigation about dragons what about because i'm in a mountain and it's my favored terrain i'm just checking for-- i wanna be sure i'm rolling what i'm supposed to-- 13 is all that i rolled though oh but some of this is westruun's it is it is it is you know what i'm going to keep it-- i'm keeping it in a separate stock because i don't want to take money away from westruun-- well we're going to put a marker in it and let westruun know that this is their gold and then we'll send them up-- yeah they can 'cause how else are we going to get it to them i'm just going to take a little bit of it what we put in is still down on the ground i think we should take 10000 but it's westruun's money how much do you need percy oh is there platinum in there we're so greedy is it no i don't want to put-- i don't want to put more i want to take less honestly all right but that's all we're taking these people are in need it's very hard to say but i don't want people being homeless and we're walking around with a bunch of gold that's-- probably but what are we going to do oh yeah like a wall or something that only lasts for a while okay but hide it well i'll hide the hole so that we tell them where it is i wonder why he's asking lame are there any pretty paintings that grab our attention i could roll it up grog it's not your call come on if you reach your hand in it can you touch the bottom of it oh what the fuck gross yeah but everything's been pouring out but there's still something in the bottom of it potions all mixing together ooh who wants this creepy looking shit i bet gilmore would know what that was what ahh should we put this inside another glass container so if it breaks it's okay the bag of colding all right layered gray-brown potion is what i'm writing can we read it it is who should read it i want to read it right now

face death on a very regular basis (sighs) and i see the way he looks at you and i see the way you look at him and happiness is fleeting in this world we don't know when it will end take advantage of it while you can and stop living in fear that's bullshit keyleth well you go on you can't think about that well i wasn't there for very long but i think there can be my brother serves death keyleth this is true yes yes i do i think it means that-- i think it means that what we do has a purpose regardless of the outcome there is a purpose no are you kidding we saved an entire town today more dragons may come but for the time being people are safe and we are safe if we are successful we could save this entire fucking world you already are anyway be happy go to him just live in the moment

that would be good for you oh don't drink it the other one was a potion of climbing which we decided-- i suck at it but anybody else can have it that's true i don't need it i have a broom i've got a broom that flies some not most who has-- this is-- who has charisma-based spells oh shit so if you read for two days and then pass it off to someone else does it just restart what did you use it on how old are you now scanlan if you keep it what if he gets even more charismatic and then he proposes again and he charms you more it's possible i kind of do want to do that he is super good at talking to people yeah yeah i carved a pretty little heart on the side of one of the boots just to make it extra girly maybe i do (laughs) what (gasps) i like it i like it oh no oh you took it off gro-- (whispers) that's for the people of westruun you're lucky he's nice grog offering all the gold to the herd instead of the people of westruun is our gold still there it's a good thing i only put a little bit in (gasps) oh shit he deserves it i knew he was going to go for the gold that's what he thought he was going to do i bent my paper (high voice) 17 oi friend ooh sir how fares-- (stuttering) how are you doing give me the book give me the book what's happening in the town are you leaving well we're here you know that dragon gone killed destroyed vox machina (laughter) thankfully that is not the case and you are smart with leaving town definitely like care bear are you responsible for these pyres you're a blacksmith armor well the dragon in the mountain is dead but there are increasingly angered dragons in other cities that will probably be coming here to retaliate more than likely great great likes to drink oh that's it that's true this one has been plundered the only other option is-- split the city up set them on different paths very quickly becoming noticeable i think we have claim to the gold that was stolen it's up in the mountain it's just hard to get down why do you pledge yourself to him you do i've never noticed a twinkle in your eye no it's a crusty from the morning you might just-- yeah why not can we make it look like it's already been burned down can we hide what do you think grog pike we could leave fassbender here to help protect everyone how are we going to get fassbender anywhere with us quall's evil this is true we did we did it's hidden in a cubby with a little mark on it oh yeah the walk around is important (groans) yes we will tell you about the basilisks oh never mind so what should we do here clear out the sewers because that's what was said did you tell her where is she we should tell her grog there's only about 200 people left do you know someone named amelia where is everyone staying within the town are they scattered about or are they staying in a central location an entire city let's make our way toward them then can i hang out outside i want to keep my eye on the skies wait what is that 32 i come back inside pat her on the back drunk already is amelia awake at this point amelia well thank you for everything you've done i've heard amazing things about you and your family i sit down next to her we have to do it right now so we knew-- your father is reginald yes he-- i take her hands one of the bravest men i've ever had the honor of meeting i know this can be-- i know how hard this is to hear but none of this would have happened none of this celebration would be possible without him he sacrificed himself so that all of us could live and he spoke your name in the end he wanted nothing more than for you to be taken care of would you like to pray pike he hid it dear there's more coming to the town you take care of yourself whoa oh shit why didn't you check up on the earring dude (yawns) where were you in that endless jug or does it only make beer and mayonnaise is it saltwater (groans) damn it grog we should probably call everyone in the town to talk is there a bartender or somebody that's running the inn that everyone's staying at or is it kind of makeshift-- can i grab someone nearby that looks like they're up and about and actually accomplishing things dear heart um-- could you spread the word that there's going to be a town meeting so we can talk about how to keep everyone safe dear yes as soon as possible can everyone meet here in the center of town where the goliaths where the barbarians-- sorry grog-- where all the mean people were all of us sweet thanks kiki who wants to talk scanlan you're so charismatic i think we need to ask them where they want to go this is true pike they know you help them take shelter in the sewers if there's danger can we ask before we go up on the stage if kerr if you're willing to help should they want that is that something you could help us with how far away is kymal was that in your book your daughter's in kymal well-- that would be terrible and pike do you want to step up there woo good leadership (laughter) huzzah that was divine intervention i thought it was like a thousand gold (in alarm) no no no but i don't want to use up all the-- we can do that after things are-- just the bunker-- no it's fine bunker it is do you see her yeah that one and the giant bag of gold it's not us keyleth it's the history of the town perk up you're driving me crazy (laughter) (kid voice) that's a shark this is a flower it's a couple days that would probably be smart i'm going to stay and help build i'm just reading these names on this wall 21 i pretend like i don't hear them i love you too that's worth more did i (laughs) i saw this little lump squirming i thought it was probably you tiny little you oh ow one day at a time ow i would like to pull kerr aside and say you know these people here they're a bit lost and they need a leader i'm looking at one that would be wonderful just something to think about oh the white iris no big deal it's the white iris i just take a little piece of chalk and i add trinket right on
