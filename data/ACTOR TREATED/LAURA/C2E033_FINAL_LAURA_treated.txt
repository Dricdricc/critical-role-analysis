you know and my mom performs there it's really nice it's really-- it's the opposite of fire caleb it's really cool sure i should probably keep myself disguised while we're here though just in case yeah i pissed off that guy and he said he would kill me no he didn't seem like the type that would really do a lot of killing himself you know yes and there's a lot of people you can talk to here if you want to get somebody killed here's the town to do it fjord you don't remember do you yeah no i pissed off this guy he was there to see my mom the traveler was teaching me different spells at the time you know i had just started learning about them so i sort of made myself look like my mother well i sort of lured him out onto the balcony yeah he was just stuck out there that's all yeah yeah yeah lord sharp no he was super not sharp oh you were talking about the mind i don't know i didn't even know he was a lord everybody was a hit job with-- everybody nobody made it out clean from that place well all over the opal archways is this really pretty-- it's a great marketplace and stuff lots of shops i didn't see too much from my window you could see all the houses it looked like a quilt it was beautiful with the roofs and you could see the ocean so i know the wharfs are around there you know you want to see my room well we can go to the ocean first fjord but what about all the sea monsters giant sea monsters there's so many i saw a giant tentacle come out of the water one time yeah i saw it from my window it was a really really really big tentacle of course i did i really really really saw a tentacle a really big one stop by the ocean it's really big it's like a lake only a lot bigger yeah imagine not and the water is not that greenish dark color it's really beautiful and light blue once we get up over this next hill you'll see the ocean i cast disguise self basically me only human all the same only yeah blue skin's gone horns are gone no tail cute little bob but it's black hair instead yeah what no it stays right there it goes in and-- most birds do that fjord do you know how to swim beau caleb's naked we can still see your weenie i can see it oh god he's

i cast sending hey mom i'm sort of in the wat-- at the beach right now well not in the water but i was wondering if you're singing tonight or if you're singing tomorrow-- (excited gasp) my mom is singing tonight you guys she doesn't sing every night you know so if we miss it we might miss it for a while no it's a special occurrence when she performs oh yeah because i think your bandages might come off in the water oh yeah you know nott you also have that fabulous ring you could just walk out onto the ocean maybe you should find out that is true guess you should have come here sooner oh i thought you meant the abyss of my backpack are you high are you high on the ocean how long of a drive is it-- of a cart ride is it to the-- whatever way is faster let's do the wharf i cast disguise self before we get up there we came to see the ruby of the sea perform tonight ha yeah i'll use the red dice for the ruby 15 we hail from port damali i am fiona fancypants theater critic extraordinaire that fell out of my hands it doesn't count oh it's the same roll shit seven oh no but she's performing soon and we're going to miss it if we go all the way around (singsong) here we go we need some money let's see how much i have i have five gold to put in his hand that's a lot of gold isn't it i don't know here you go as long as i've been alive i don't know you don't know how old i am caleb i thought it would have been obvious and i turn around and walk away yeah a few weeks ago well he grew up in a whole different city well only after i left here the opal archway no you go i'll just repeat it it's okay most of the crownsguard here don't really give a shit when they get stationed out here they're like okay okay and they do the fun stuff too well here's the thing you can steal stuff if you want nott but the laws are enforced a little bit stricter here what else is there really between stealing and murder oh that's a good one oh right it was right on the tip of my tongue we get lots of visitors all the time does it seem like the same amount that's always been there 13 (whispering) there's probably diplomats there tonight she hasn't started yet you guys sure but if you don't hear singing she hasn't gone yet no i never had to so yeah it's probably free yeah well i mean it wasn't a hotel to me we had a lot of the top floor you mean like as a human or would they know me as a me well yeah of course they would well i'm disguised yeah okay has it been an hour well two more since-- wait okay okay i just recast it what do you mean how are we going to get in we go in they don't know you they know me and i don't even look like me what i thought it was just a thing yes we're going to be staying here it's an owl what is that for no that's for money for this particular thing i think it was it looks like we're really well off though that's good they're staying with me i'm not giving these things up well the weasel is tucked in so really no one will notice it but yes i'm walking in with a dog my mom will want to meet him no blink dogs don't pee it's a rule it's canon yeah his name is sprinkle yeah it's really pretty it's basically the nicest kind you can get it's really fancy isn't it pretty i used to run up and down these stairs late at night or marion yeah i do sure i recognize that bartender and that bartender and-- yep a couple of them have been upstairs if you know what i mean the lady of the night if you will yeah and considering that she's singing tonight it seems really empty in here what's that about she doesn't do that it would cost a lot of money what we should probably get a table as soon as possible where's the backstage door where do i get to my mom i want to go upstairs yeah well she comes down from those stairs so make sure you got a good view of that i go up to it i knock on the door and say good evening marion lavorre the little sapphire has come to see you i'm here to see the ruby of the sea i know tell her that i'm here i know tell her tell her (shouting) the little sapphire's here to see you ruby it's me excuse me nadine i run forward and give her a big hug (whispers) it's a spell i'm actually still me don't worry i missed you so much i wanted to come home sooner but we got distracted because we went to the empire oh that's right i sent you messages yeah it's really cold and the people are pretty strict but there's some really nice people that you can meet i met a lot of friends you should meet them they're downstairs here i put her hand on my horn so she can tell it's there is it okay with-- be careful of the weasel his name is sprinkle mama i'm going to say i left nugget downstairs with you guys yeah i will of course do you want me to finish lacing you up your performance is tonight we went to a town and it was burned down and we killed a bunch of gnolls and we took off their ears then we went to another city and we fought these fish people in this swamp and it was really crazy oh my gosh you should meet this monk girl that i know she's crazy and she fights with her fists and also with a staff and she's really strong there's this other girl who has wings and i tell her all about it fighting so much you should see how strong i've gotten well i mean okay do you want me to punch you you look beautiful mama oh right i can't disguise myself anymore though can i borrow a cloak or something shit okay that's all that i'll do i'll cast it again all my spell slots okay i run back downstairs she's almost ready she's so beautiful yeah no of course she was sure yes of course she is yeah no i've never seen them before have you eaten any of this cheese it's really good oh thank you i told you i was rich do you tip here i never really get to watch from down here i see it yeah nice good luck isn't she wonderful turn your fucking thing away from me it's hurting my heart i know oh i don't know we never counted it well i mean she lives here but she gets paid for other things and the tips from the singing the singing pulls in the other things you know what i mean that's her thaumaturgy i do i make the lights flare just a little bit keep your pants on are you all in love with her now well yeah she sang to me all the time sometimes mostly it was just her though be that pretty and graceful and sing really good and have a bunch of people think she's wonderful no of course not i like myself just the way i am thanks beau thanks fjord when did you hear me sing oh that's right i did sing for you you're welcome yeah big scary dude well of course usually after the performance is taken by other things (singsong) he probably got turned away because my mom was already taken it's kind of a wait list but usually she only has you know a few patrons during any given period of time so she'll have the best diplomats that come to town and if they've claimed that time then they can spend time with her for an entire week or even more and nobody else will come to see her you know what i mean sometimes there's a lot of people that want to marry her and have tried to court her and stuff like that but she only ever you know said yes to my dad yeah there's lot of security guards around here unfortunately it would usually-- you know she'd come tuck me into bed late at night afterwards sometimes i would already be asleep but she'd come in and say i'm just saying good night to you love then she would go and then we'd wake up and sometimes we'd have breakfast but sometimes we wouldn't and then sometimes she was gone for a few days at a time because the people here they don't really want to know about their daughters or anything like that so i would stay hidden she would tell me to and then sometimes she'd be free and then we could have lunch or something i can send a message or-- tell you what i'm not going to waste a spell slot i'm just going to run upstairs and tell nadine to not disturb my mom but to ask if it's okay if i come by tomorrow maybe what really mama that's so wonderful i'll be right back can they come upstairs do you know if we can stay here tonight we'll see what they think i run downstairs (shouting) you can talk to her tonight we can go back upstairs come on i turn back around and go running back upstairs we could stay here forever if we wanted to this is fjord i meet him earliest he's a half-orc and he's growing his teeth back and he's very handsome this is beau she's really strong she's the one i was telling you about that can fight things with a stick this is caleb he's a wizard he has a lot of fire and stuff he likes his books and he used to smell bad but he doesn't anymore he likes water now this is nott she's very very brave even though she's very small be careful of your rings that's right because we are detectives and we're really good at solving cases she's my partner in crime (whispers) this is what she really looks like see you are adorable and this is caduceus he's got pink hair he used to live in a cemetery he doesn't know a lot of things (whispering) he doesn't know anything about sex (louder) and he drinks dead people tea i know they've saved my life you know and i've saved theirs because i'm a really good cleric did you know that i do that now i can heal people mom oh no he's not here the healing yeah i know yeah oh hold on let me go get the aerator (gasps) i can't wait to hear them what happened with lord sharp did he cause too much of a stink yeah we do really good things most of the time though we should show her the letter yeah like remember we told you we were detectives oh not at all go for it yeah it says evantica we'll figure it out socialization why mama what are you talking about was he the guy that was here tonight we lure him outside of the chateau and then we kill him i don't want him to hurt you mom maybe we can get him to fall in love with someone else yeah but that links it back to her his great servant beneath the city what was his last name really you guys will stay here mama they're going to take care of you that's why i ran out of money thank you for sending that package by the way no no no it's fine we do a really good job have you heard of him mama he's blue as well and he's always sweaty dark hair yeah he's always really wet was he nice or was he not nice yeah wait a minute but not the gentleman though he has dark hair he's got black hair that's really long no oh my gosh okay well he lives in zadash and he lives in a bar and he's got long black hair and he's really charming but kind of snarky at the same time he wasn't in the leaky tap no no we have a gift for him or something we have many gifts or something i never asked he did wear lots of rings on his fingers babenon i didn't ask if that was his name though babenon babenon dosal but you said he lived in the ocean oh my god what if the gentleman is my dad well we don't know for sure do you have a picture of him do you have a drawing of him i've got a drawing of the gentleman in my sketchbook well this is pure gold what's happening here it looks like daria jester's a really good drawer even though i'm not imagine this is like davinci that is him he has our blood yeah he's in zadash do you want to go see him oh my gosh oh my gosh i'm going to send him a message okay and then we can see if it's him i send a message to the gentleman oh my god oh my god is your name babenon dosal have you ever been to the menagerie coast oh my god do you know the ruby of the sea oh my god no he's gotten my messages before he knows it's me i've seen him having sex and stuff we haven't seen it but we know but i wanted him to be true to her forever i'm going to try one more time what do i have is it nighttime already okay i'm going to think about what i'm going to say on this one i'm using my pearl of power it's my last 3rd-level spell okay hello gentleman this is jester please respond just yes if you've seen the ruby please is that 20 oh oh shit balls (laughter) that's preposterous he says i didn't even think to ask about him in zadash because i thought he would be in the ocean yeah he told mama he was in the ocean decades holy shit of course i know how old i am i'm just questioning my mom's math is all i stretch not a freebie goodnight mama well kind of stupid for not thinking to ask the gentleman when we met him but-- i did think it was fun that we were meeting somebody else who was blue are there that's true why would i need a swim oh really it's actually pretty dangerous to go through the skews at night they're not webbed what if he's my dad you guys is that bad that i put that out there i'll just send him messages every day taliesin and it's going to be so long before we go back to zadash maybe okay i guess so it's pretty late yeah sure just that he was very charming and that he wore lots of rings on his fingers and that you know-- well that he lived on an island in the sea and they were going to get married he said he wanted to and he went to prepare his house and never came back she thought maybe something bad happened to him but she said he was very charming and very sweet and very funny he always made her laugh i am she's really wonderful isn't she we should go to sleep great i slept really good that he stops okay okay what's your idea that's perfect but then i might have to stay with him i don't want to do that i wonder where the concord-- yeah where they're based isn't there a headquarters the marquis okay yeah why are we talking to the wharfmaster i'm so confused let's go i'm going to the lighthouse i said it's really pretty we should go inside i wonder if it looks like-- you can still tell that there's boobs from the inside (snickering) maybe you can sleep in one of the boobs let's go (knocking) (knocking louder) it's haunted she's a really big beacon hi do you sleep in the boob it's really nice so this is kind of like a temple then you climb all these stairs all the time what are we supposed to ask about oh it's her eyeballs just kidding it's where her clavicle is this is a really good home you get a lot of visitors here really but it's so cool inside why don't people want to come see you it's my mom a mother so there's your in right there algar do you see where he goes do you know where he lives can i look through your spyglass please easily distracted it's shiny aw why though 11 why though at the sluice oh i don't want to be arrested you're not hideous you're wonderful and you're beautiful on the outside too i think you're beautiful that's the laughing thing she said does she start walking us down the stairs i'm not trying to gank the telescope maybe i am well i wanted to-- before she started ushering us out-- to invoke duplicity and make it look like i was in front her but really stay behind oh i'm going to give myself the blessing of the trickster motherfuck no eight not stealthy mm-hmm yeah i'm coming downstairs okay shit have you heard of our lord and savior the traveler she's pretty cool i liked her a lot she loved us we were great me and my duplicate skip away how long have we been outside now i'm doing my disguise spell and keeping it up the whole time

doesn't it's underwater or something we need to get a boat but we can't just go there because we'll be arrested don't know the old lady said that yeah something like that submerged gates or something
