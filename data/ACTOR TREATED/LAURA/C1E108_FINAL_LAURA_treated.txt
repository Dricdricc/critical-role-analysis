big empty pyramid triangle thing i was on my broom because i had been hovering looking at it about there then not so soon (grumbling) 23 oh god i want to attack them i'm going to attack the one next to percy attack-style i'm going to hunter's mark him and then i'm going to attack him i'm going to do this and then this and then this god dang it that was a miss it was a one it was a natural one fuck i do it again oh my god 21 okay well that's good oh my god i'm going to scream yeah i know bro you're not bro you're hubby 14 don't say other numbers 14 plus seven is 21 24 how high is the ceiling yeah i'm going to fly up all right i'm going to go to the roof oh yeah some of that was lightning damage that was two points of lightning damage because they're made of metal i don't know if that did anything special oh wait i get 3d6 of sneak attack now an extra four only hunter's mark once on your attack just kidding it's hunter's mark every time yeah no i know that yeah sneak attack's only once but hunter's mark is every time don't give him ideas stop it wow do we still have our death ward on get him grog 29 is not terrible did you know that maybe he doesn't see you because you're above him i know oh no it can jump that high 25 if i'm prone do i still get to roll to roll through the coals to avoid it or some shit i think for you you count the poop as a 20 i think poop is normally one you got a one as well okay which is what flames help it fire heals them cold damage do cold damage 31 divided by two yeah do something amazing they're technically both equidistant from you well plus a 1d12 i'll figure it out can you hit the two that are by us how much damage is it put me out i wouldn't be on fire anymore do it unless they're magic maybe it'll push me out of the coals oh do i roll a dexterity save too i think i fail it oh no 16 fail yay did i get pushed out of the coals from the water is it up through all the way to the ceiling you know what seriously though thanks keyleth okay so i'm going to stand up i can see him good enough though to shoot him am i at disadvantage because he's prone but he's right there okay well i'm going to back up because he can't take a strike at me right i'm going to back towards the stairs where scanlan is thanks scanlan does that cutting words him down to 19 or 18 then he doesn't hit me great i think i'm going to then try to attack him okay ugh natural 20 was one of them 30 is the first attack oh so if i hadn't moved away i would have been okay yeah so it's not cancelled out if i hadn't moved it would have been never mind we'll just fucking say it's fine because then i'm going to wish i had that crit i just got so 30 was the attack roll okay (groans) okay that is 13 14 15 15 plus one lightning damage plus six sneak-- no sneak attack just kidding there's the hunter's mark five hunter's mark that's the first attack and the second attack at disadvantage is 19 fuck yeah sorry can i use my bonus to hide behind one of those pillars 16 it's foggy in this room 41 it's just another attack oh you got to it it's so good when they're within range of grog can we get some paper towels liam and it may have landed on some wires somebody's running now soon as we said wires the worst it's seriously under the box though on the wires it's everywhere how is there so much coffee i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself good job grog see if you can smelt some platinum into that thing grog should it be platinum should probably be platinum yeah you know how to do it because you're a blacksmith now no it's already got a pyramid in it puzzle piece got to fit them together with the jaggedy ends or with the smooth ends (shouting) let's put it in the big thing yep let's go we push it in harder this is definitely going to be really good 15 laura and yeah grog you try oh jesus there's a dent in it now hey i've got an idea what if we take this thing off of the cross beams right and stick it in the coals or something because why are the coals here right underneath it i don't know oh yeah good idea but we should reignite these coals because i think it's bad that they've burned down right now can we turn the circle does it move gosh darn it what are we supposed to do maybe it's supposed to be gold i think this needs to be gold dear well the outside is gold we can try it we have gold good call we got to fucking try it in gold try it in gold maybe try it in gold what is it (gasps) what are the armors made out of can we melt the golems into their heads melt each one maybe it's got to be the metal they're made out of yeah so take some of the metal and melt it down into the head so maybe can we melt it i feel like that makes it special melt their body into their face and make triangles out of the metal you guys are so smart about this stuff then we should do gold wait how come it was 300 oh it's not the same worth it's the coin let's put it in the key no i already said that i had them no no he doesn't do that yeah and i'm hiding behind the pillar that i'm next to oh my god it's so good st nicholas a giant anvil 17 that sound is creepy as fuck over the anvil and the figure is 20 feet fall you said oh no again maybe he's a friendly giant really creepy-looking entity maybe he's the allfather is that what he's called in and out super fast dart up to him and go (taunting) and then dart back just fly in really fast be creepy and quick you've got fuzz on your face can i get it no you got it it was right on his lip so every time he talked-- it's got to be you because you're so fast if you get his attention you can dart out really fast should we try talking to him maybe it's better you can speak celestial too right you don't just read it i thought celestial sounded more like singing tell him we were sent by pelor i'm floating behind him on a broom does it have to be single file with this okay then i'm going to be back over to the side of scanlan the ground is still super duper hot right tell him nod yes once for yes and shake his head no i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself one more time while this is happening maybe if you use it the right way it will be fine yeah yeah i take mine out of my pocket okay in your vision of how to do it did you see this guy the hammer that he let go of what if you go and try to pick up that hammer first do you need it is his sword as big as our table is across well i pulled mine out you've got this scanlan come on well it's not like you can step up to the anvil before the metal's hot anyway right so maybe we're stepping up to the anvil too soon maybe you have to heat the metal first i wouldn't send him any closer to the anvil though it might send him in attack mode well yeah i'm going to fly up next to grog but i'm not going to go past him and i'm going to hold up the little bead of power i'm going to step one step forward with it no further than grog stepped that first time all right i back up fuck i'm going to fly to the side against the wall yeah that's what i was going to do so i could shoot it around yeah and i'm going to shoot an oracle arrow behind him to see what's going on over there i wasn't even shooting at him tell us where to get it 14 we are fucked make peace (laughter) obviously doesn't give a shit about me any more i gave them back top of my turn i'm going to fart and you're on fire he can walk he can move maybe it's an illusion doesn't hit sup dice he really wrote sup dice oh jeebies oh i can use disengage so he doesn't hit me i'm going to move away from him all the way across over here i don't remember because i don't have the thing anymore i know matthew i think it's 40 probably 50 feet i'm writing it down right now okay i'm going to attack him that dice attacked me while i rolled it a 23 oh lord okay i thought because he was big maybe is he covered head to toe in armor great okay so i'm going to attack him again but in his neck oh that's good that probably hits 18 plus 14 okay i didn't want to do the math (counting) do i get sneak attack wait that's lightning one extra lightning damage and then nine sneak attack 17 plus nine is 27 plus one lightning damage so it's 27 but he says it in swedish taliesin and it's okay that's great grog definitely won't fall in the lava on his turn to keep him from wandering off it shut him up for a little bit no can you uncanny dodge don't you have another thing oh no wait don't you have to roll the constitution is it a visual spell guys this is bad we haven't actually done anything to him have we no i got an arrow on him it was a magical arrow we can't even run away he's going to kill all of us dude he can get all of us in a circle everybody doesn't hit (gasps) oh my god can you inspire yourself inspire yourself great i'm going to disengage i'm going to go over to grog i'm going to fly next to him and i'm going to touch him and i'm going to cast lesser restoration on him heals blindness and deafness he needs to be able to fucking see so he can smith while we're trying to distract this fucker yeah that's the thing he was holding well okay do i have any more movement left do i have any more movement left that's my last level two that i cast great so i don't have any more lesser restorations i can cast it at a higher level maybe i don't know why you would grab the hammer i mean that's all i can do that's my action my bonus and my movement you should probably get out right i want to try to move bigby's hand to hold on to his arm can i try it that's amazing hey scanlan you should have done that before that would have been really cool you can't be blinded as a planetar can you there's no way to run away from him we have to either defeat him or find a way to disengage him his weapon is grappled right now so i don't know if you'd have advantage on trying to disarm him i feel like he's invulnerable i'm just above you telling you how hot you look as you're doing it right after you were healed well bonus action is vow of enmity (singing) bigby's hand it's the sword it throws him off balance his concentration maybe no he said you were in range he was in range right when you moved aw he can even get scanlan but he's so little ooh that hits and the elemental i'm going to uncanny dodge oh no ugh i'm blind do i remember where he was can i shoot in his general vicinity even though i'm blind 21 won't hit him right okay so i'm going to try it again goddamn it no it's at disadvantage neither of them hit okay let's see if this is-- nope it's an action because i'm a genius i'm going to back up i don't know if that'll do anything i'm going to disengage and i'm going to back up on my broom great i'm rolling so good tonight shush 17 oh i'm on my broom so i was flying backwards as far back as i can without dying oh no why what are you at what is your-- you can't die he can't die that's a rule yeah 12 yay it's okay it's all right i forgot hunter's mark for so many episodes does grit give you advantage oh but you're still unconscious did he go under tell me you're not unconscious i think i can get him out yeah okay all right can i get to scanlan from my position on the map all right then i'm going to pick him up can i use my action to-- can i use my bonus action to dash away okay i'm going to back up into the corner at least i got him out of the lava but that's it that's everything scanlan's dead unconscious kill it whoa it was a trial you had to be able to beat him in order to forge here i'm putting scanlan out because he's still on fire scanlan is not on fire anymore he's still unconscious so i'm going to cast cure wounds at level one because that's what i can do so i'm going to cast cure wounds on him to bring him back to life so six points scanlan that's what you've got yeah you're low double digits too i hope he won't come back to life as soon as we start yeah we should probably if we can take a short rest just so you guys can think about your process know exactly what you're doing 19 scanlan you got a lot of hit dice that you can roll i'm back to 144 so these trammels need to be made out of platinum you know how to do it right okay so what do we do they're going to be melted so we have to get into the other room first before we do any of that can i fly over and see if i can find any kind of apparatus that would-- 30 okay and i'm assuming that i'm not strong enough to pull on that chain right i can try i'm going to try yeah but you can't fly anymore you fly on one and i'll try to get the other one oh i rolled a 13 can the guardian do it hey you that was attacking us can you get those chains (laughs) really yeah it wasn't a very persuasive thing to say 14 it's too high or she could probably lift grog up you're very angry about it yeah there's no inspiration-- oh no he rested yeah 300 platinum each oh would those little pyramids work to make the trammels or it needs more i got 4920 platinum make sure you use some of those pyramids we made though 1500 per trammel of platinum okay we're fine yeah can you get your calculator out never mind i can do this it myself you might shatter that jug can i fly around and see what we can see we've got a trough we're cheering them on the side good forging fold that metal oh god all right here we go does he need inspiration scanlan yeah don't do it get it off of there grog no he hasn't used it (gasps) try it again i'm going to over and rub his muscles do you want to inspire him again scanlan oh no try one more time can he try again try it though oh motherfuck do you get any more inspiration scanlan okay but now you can add things so he can still add one d4 on this he needs as much as you can give him scanlan so one (laughter) now we got to twist them does he have any more inspiration wait keep inspiring but he hasn't announced it like what whisper can we look around for a little teeny hammer 12 for me so probably not so much have you picked it up maybe it changes shape cat's grace is what dexterity we might be able to fix it oh my god i'm looking i've got nothing this is a step up from fine leather boots grog or are you tapped out do you have any spells left scanlan so we head into the mansion if we're in the mansion he can't see us so that's the only thing it might be good to rest inside the mansion so he can't attack us before we attack him we don't know fuck it we'll do it live taliesin and no he's not i saw his balls i saw his golden balls oh goodness gracious we got to get all of our stuff do we need to bring our own binder to gencon
