kidding wait i heard you say you were from nogvurot yes did you notice any of the kids that were missing up there oh we're really good at keeping secrets well let's general charisma check-- oh that would be a natural one there is that what you're being paid for up there wow how many people are in your group whoa what kind of techniques just in case you know we have to fight you we have to go sign up for this we need to get coins where did you get those coins you have a blacksmith in the thing we need to go sign up for the tournament you too darrow why a nine though i thought the nine meant that-- i'm going to start practicing making a cool logo for us in my sketchbook got some new specs there do you need those and we never knew your glasses fell off when you were bent over yeah let's sign up what a festival aren't those the same kind-- should we go in then yes is this where we go if we're going to fight how do we be one of the fights oh no we're real good you definitely want us to be in this we put on a real good show i don't know i wonder how experienced these fighters are do you think it's stupid that we're signing up for it without knowing much a cook-off that is true it could be fjord you're really good at making chili yes yes yes all over everywhere and nowhere yes that's good we are from lots of places after all we'll have to leave one of our members-- are there rules or are we just allowed to use whatever we come into the tournament with only three schmeasly other groups fancypants 20 gold there you are what happens if somebody in one of the other groups dies or something when fighting the creatures good to know for the other groups yes cat butt right in their face i guess i'm going to do some jumping jacks to prepare for this i would much prefer if it was actually a leather thong that you had to put on in order to get the mage armor how do we prepare for this fjord i don't think we can oh yes (jibberish) that's not noticeable at all oh no well take it off oh that's the garrison over by the-- on our side or their side i mean who cares right good thing we didn't join the army huh oh no maybe if you competed and they saw you were awesome they're going to tell you you have to join all of us or just you and nott (whispers) he's got a crush on you i can tell we have a little box traveling with us there will be a very unhappy day tomorrow i hope we don't have to fight him nine oh he was supposed to go right 16 me is he in white is that the color of robes he-- whoa do we all fight the same type of creature that's us oh my god oh no oh my god that's so cool yeah where did the monster come out of oh okay can you help me i want to be there oh right there's multiple doors it's a big eating-poop pile yeah gag me with a spoon mrs henderson that's what she does fists of fury mrs henderson they're like balsa wood i start laughing oh let's see what it weirdly does it's going to poop on you ew it's like charlie how much damage did he do 15 fucking points oh no you're poisoned whoa that's good okay well he's right there so i'm going to use sacred flame on him oh actually i'm really close and he's already been hurt i'm going to toll the dead on him that is a wisdom saving throw i get to hit him seven points of damage i want to back away did he already use his reaction at all oh no no fuck it i'm going to stay right there you get advantage remember okay sorry no not its poop mouth oh no that hits me i'm going to use hellish rebuke on him yeah you still don't have any stupid arms stupid hellish rebuke is a 2nd-level i really wish it gave more information about what-- it doesn't say anywhere what hellish rebuke-- oh there it is dexterity save that means i get 3d10 12 how much damage did you say i just took though because i was busy 19 points of damage if you feel like attacking oh that's me yeah i think so what do you add to it it's 18 it landed in my box but it landed up oh god does it look like it's hurting at all while i'm in its grasp can i touch the tentacle and cast toll the dead again i want to do that okay two i probably should have tried to un-restrain myself it's an action well i already did it i already tolled the dead so too late i guess so there could be 17 times two is 34 that was amazing i'm going to cast thaumaturgy and start whispers throughout the crowd going (chanting) yasha yasha hopefully the crowd picks it up yes i've got one kit left so i'm going to use my medicinal herbs on you beau to get rid of the poison i'm very low hit point-wise i'm at 12 out of 31 huh oh i can use my spells to heal us right now the only thing i have that can get rid of poisoning is lesser restoration which i can cast on yasha right now i can get rid of the poison on you it's probably-- no it's not an herbalism kit it's medicinal herbs which you specifically told me it removes poison on action oh okay oh no i'm proficient-- oh that's good yeah it's a 23 yeah i'll do it i'm at 12 hit points yasha you need healing too are you sure it's what how many d4 2d4 good luck i'm going to take a healing potion that was intense would we be able to have fought those two minotaurs marisha and is it possible to climb up on one of the walls i'm going to try and climb up on top of the wall that's really good this one sure why not yeah it's a 22 beau ten points i invoke duplicity in the middle of the-- next to nott yeah next to nott 22 six again fjord i'm going to cast sacred flame at the one behind me that's a dex save yes five points of damage to him i'm going to make my invoked duplicity jester run right in the middle of the two walls past fjord yeah and she's going to start going (gibberish) even though i am high up 20 already eight points to me halved because i'm resistant to cold damage roll high oh no 26 points are you raging oh no no attack the one that's by all of us having seen beau do that just then and it looked really cool i'm going to jump off the wall with my handaxe in my hand and try to come down onto the back of the one right there that is a 17 to hit nine points of damage can i back up is it going to get an attack of opportunity oh no well i'm going to move around him i'm going to move to his tail to the pillar yeah how you want to do this i pet him and say good doggy it is definitely sneak attack everyone's up both me and my invoked jester go ooh it was so slow-- maybe the dice gods really want the charity to do well i'm going to toll the dead my invoked jester is going to run around and stand next to fjord 14 no toll or anything i think that's basically all i can do though the minute that it ends i'm going to start casting prayer of healing yeah who all is injured right now one two three four you're not and you're not at all okay so i'm going to cast it on the five of us yeah oh yeah that's what i'm asking i can do six people that's decent 14 points to everyone i need to learn that i was hoping they would lose well we attack and then run to the middle we might get a surprise attack on them let's do it invoke duplicity i think lasts for-- i want to say an hour but i don't know if it does i'm going to go with me and you molly on the other door okay i'm going to hop up-- i'm going to do the same thing and hop up on a wall like last time i'm going to hold my attack for the door that-- i want to be on the other one you're too close no there was just fjord yeah he moved oh god
