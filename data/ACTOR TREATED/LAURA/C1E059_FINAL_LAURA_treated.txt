show next week so everybody that comes and sees that will get to see a picture of it live just like you guys at home that 30 seconds makes a huge difference the amount of texts that went back and forth between all of us trying to decide what the top three were going to be was really-- no that's not true no it was pretty fun oh shit grog already well i have no idea how to get our bearings here unfortunately perhaps it might be wise to move quietly brilliant it's very dangerous and i'm afraid they don't understand (whispering) will-o'-wisps 20 maybe can i climb a tree close by athletics can i use my acrobatics to hop up ooh swing myself parkour acrobatics with disadvantage 24 oh no i should've saved it (laughs) nope time is different in the feywild what yes that's why i'm staying in the trees brother i will if it looks safe does it look safe can i see from my height can i see a better view of the ruins and everything oh and this is forest right taliesin and you sneaky here we go i got 25 on my perception do i see any life forms around does this look similar to the pool that was on the other side of the portal i wouldn't know i come down and i watch as keyleth makes a stupid move don't pick anything there was something in the water on the other side of the ruins i'm not lying we should probably hide 29 what happened did she say anything grog did you recognize that woman you didn't see the naked woman come up over that wall i come down out of the tree can you just be quiet for two seconds (shushing) grog there was a naked woman in a pool that reminded me of maybe the pool on the other side we were jumping over from close to that portal right could it be the nymph that you stole the heart of would it be safe for you to see her again and maybe ask for her to cure our friend here or would you-- is she dangerous to be around what'd she do to you well i worry if we go try to talk to her if it's not her then she could blind all of us percival would you like something to hold onto as you walk yes of course i pop trinket out hi buddy trinket we're in a very weird place a weird place things can happen trinket can you help percival walk he's blind she's back in whitestone now don't walk him into any trees trinket dear don't touch anything she jumped over the wall here i can try it's right past the ruins right there darling can't you see grog do you want to give it a go just go see if it's her be quiet-- okay she went in the water grog she was in the water before i'll come with you to the water hey does this look like the pool you came into on the other side remember her name scanlan whisper to grog what to say to draw a lady out you're very charismatic and repeat what you hear scanlan say use your earring pike it's been five fucking minutes you missed the naked chick there's a naked chick she blinded percival with her beauty we all get down on a knee how does it work i bet pike has a few tricks up her sleeve yes actually we all are have you heard tale of a sick tree something very cancerous on the land this one holds a bow at its heart in a bog something about glass i just started a page on the feywild and now it's already-- there it is wow sounds lonely i have a book on me would you like it well i basically have it memorized at this point i've read it so many times that'll be 30 gold (laughter) 50 gold thank you what were those little colored lights that disappear as we get close do they lead you anywhere i was wondering if you have any sort of-- you're very well-versed with this area any form of protection you could offer us or recommend to us as we move forward in this confusing land 26 maybe grog oh well that's true oh that's attractive how's it feel (laughter) of your realm yeah we do that too be honest you totally (tongue click) did you did you get it on with her all right oh that's right you didn't have a beard before toward the shademirk i don't know if he needs it (stage whisper) it's okay trinket well you know that's how it goes he is one of our sharpshooters thank you very much it really would hey i want to heal you all right how long has he been working on that give it a go trinket come here yay can we start moving forward yeah we leave them perception check 27 i feel like i remember hearing that the time here is very strange maybe it moves slower here i don't know does it feel like we're moving forward do you think it's safe if i fly up and look at the sky i'm going to try flying up all right i'm going to try flying up above the canopy i'm assuming i'm not in the forest anymore right 17 flickering do i see any sign of a city the sky looks the same well at least we know we've made some headway i go back down there's a tree line at least i think we should reach it soon right we're not out of the tree line yet hello is somebody there ooh natural 20 (stage whisper) did anybody else see that okay cool did it look childlike or adultlike oh okay just be ready behind us i saw you did you want to say hello all right i guess we'll have fun over here without you laugh like i told a really funny joke (forced laughter) so funny anything that's true do you guys want to ride trinket and see do you still have barkskin nice oh as we're walking first question do i see any form of path through this grass the flicker of light i saw in the distance are we going to intersect it in the direction that we're going okay so i'll keep an eye in that direction as we move forward but i want to talk to you keyleth i've been trying to find out a way to talk to trinket like i know you can right i was wondering if maybe you could teach me how to do that do you think that's possible okay i have a spell slot available for speak with animals that i never claimed that i want to learn i will definitely keep that in mind i let her do that and i'm going to keep walking normally i'm learning so much can i walk up to trinket and say hey buddy can you understand me yeah do you understand me (screams) i hug him so hard oh my gosh could you understand me all the time oh darling but now i understand you and it's wonderful okay quick question do you mind being in my necklace or does it bother you what's it like is it terrible because i don't want to do it if you hate it no you haven't okay well that's good well i basically wanted to say that i love you so much (sobbing) i start crying oh this is the best spell ever i can't believe i didn't know it before trinket thanks keyleth thanks buddy you can wait you can cool it's like when your dog comes in the room when you're peeing it's a little awkward at first when you hear about it but it's fine it's okay i'm fine with it whatever if you understood what he was saying which you don't for a while as long as my spell lasts i want to keep talking to trinket and catch up on old times oh right that was so good right i love the feywild we're walking do we feel tired there was that kid that we talked to there was a creature in the woods i saw it we have food we're on our way two days duskward see two days two days it's two days yeah when we feel tired-- i do want to make sure that nothing's following us on occasion and make sure that nothing is around we'll get separated 18 we are heading towards something i'm not sure what it is what else are we going to do can i fly up on the broom and see if i can see anything in the field around us or look for any movement in the grass i put my fucking hat on and me 25 oh whispers whispers he's been chewing on that just so you know in addition to that do i see anything in the grass around us can i fly down near it does he see me i want to float down above him on the broom and lay down on the broom and say what are you drawing nothing at all on those people up there oh interesting why not you know you probably could get a better view of them if you were riding on this broom i'm not looking i'm not falling for that nope can i insight check him and see 16 i'm not going to bite you can i fly down and grab his wrist and fly up oh okay athletics oh great 15 now i spin around and see if there's anything behind me sneaky little fuck it really is i think we should go say hi to my friends don't you we're in need of company dear and we fly down hello to everyone well look at this friend i just found gentle grog gentle what are you don't squeeze him grog no reading just drawing percy our friend percival here he likes to draw as well garmelie i saw what you were drawing and it was quite lovely don't you want to share there's nothing wrong with drawing a funny picture i love them honestly i think you're quite talented where do your clothes come from where do you live so you know this area quite well so you could potentially guide us grog be nice to our guest i have a deal for you we could offer you-- dinner delicious dinner chicken have you ever had chicken it's so wonderful if you happen to lead us where we want to go we'll tell you in a little bit i fly off and i go grab the quill i didn't even make it into the square it was pathetic 27 grog let him go grog put him down and put your hand on his shoulder let's hold hands as we walk through the door oh shit we can talk about that my talent includes taming otters i wish no that's my other stupid talent but i wanted an excuse to have an otter here oh it was magical 22k and a red panda that's not official 25k and a talent show though is real i don't want any badly poached animals taken from their environment i know that was terrible is there a carpet here just a picnic i would have a picnic with you darling why don't we eat and we'll get to the questions in a little bit let's give him a rest i shocked him when i abducted him i would like some of that as well grog can i pull vax aside for a moment and ask do you want to go to syngorn we could avoid it right of course we should go see them of course why wouldn't i please and i walk back to the group keyleth that's a bit forward can i have some more ale as well grog keep it coming all around acquire what do you steal darling it certainly will i searched for it was it a special quill i'm sorry the shademirk there's a very scary tree there what do you know about the shademirk do you have drawings have you drawn things from there garmelie that creature is it very large oh shit well we'll protect you have you heard of a very large-- well i don't know if it's large a very scary tree there something poisoning the land i've got no problem stealing from any of those people the feywild slippery sneaky if we can't steal the things then the deal is off well i trust you percy if you think it's smart did you do it i have no love for that city i don't care ultimately i would love to ask them to help us in our fight they're cowardly and stupid for hiding but we could use their help if they're making an army they did of course they did they're a city we had a fight instructor when we were growing up i'm sorry i said i'm sorry i looked for 20 fucking minutes i looked all right no it is really nice i know you're acting like he's lying but he's telling the fucking truth sure why not me i'm pretty sure he was talking to me actually why should we avoid the hut what does wodenna do she's a hag is she a hag maybe we should move him to a safe location that we can lock maybe some sort of magical thing that he put on me because i'm pretty sure he cast something on me and my brother a shiver when we shook his hand can we try it on me and my brother see if it cancels out whatever he just did everything i'm wearing is magic what is it about this dimension that makes us get naked all the time thank you so i take off everything except for the hat do i feel anything i'm definitely putting my clothes back on lock the door no not anymore that is really creepy i get very little sleep i'm having trouble sleeping oh jeez wow i'm going to get up early and try to fix my hair and make it as pristine as i can and try to clean off my clothes and everything before we go percy was charmed yes before we made the deal with him fuck percy i made the deal because you said it was fine it's fine you didn't know well it's our own stupid fault we knew we weren't supposed to trust anything here why did you want to fix his whistle you just liked him damn it i thought you knew something we didn't know i really thought you did percy change of subject would you say i look put together well off with this armor well you come from money right right so do i look like i come from money (laughs) i don't believe that no well you know everyone we were judged growing up and i don't look forward to seeing that again it's not important (laughs) (laughs) i like the way you think thank you percy will you stay at my side when we're there (laughs) all right good night we'll sort out this charmed mess in the morning that sounds so good this picture is disgusting i flick his head well it's gross but everybody else looks quite wonderful i do think we should inform you though we may have used a little magic on you sorry just to make sure the deal was solid you're going to walk us right in that's not sneaky at all i fully trust you i hate him now what sort of magic did you cast on us what was the deal we agreed to what will happen if it breaks yeah we fucked that up didn't we that was amazing pike i don't think i've ever seen anyone play an instrument that well oh that's terrible poor guy we are really shit at making friends he's going to show us it's going to disappear as soon as we take it out leave it in the mansion that way it'll stay no there's no way we could sneak in with what he has some fancy cloaks unless he's used them all can't you craft something to keep the rain off of us perception check see if i can see anything moving ahead of us 29 garmelie what are these let's leave it what's this this is not woods anymore this is not forest is this marsh 21 i take my hood down you know us we're here to see my father the twins vex'ahlia and vax'ildan do we know who she is we came to speak to our father 14 i'll stop using that one tonight can you still feel him oh sorry watcher iova nice to see you have elevated
