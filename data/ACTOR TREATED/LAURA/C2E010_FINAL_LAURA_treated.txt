yeah no it's been more than once maybe you can do an interpretive dance there as well there is no end to dick jokes and look how cute it looks under overalls those are in the store right now as well as our new cr logo shirt which nobody is wearing okay i'll get one for you at geekandsundrycom the shop there it is yeah it is it's like the sophisticated version yeah we have some dice as well as lots of other merch so check it out oh hi no not so much not a lot of money no no nothing really but i saw the traveler so that's good news everyone he's still around he's here he's probably hanging out with us right now yes well probably yes well not a lot of people know who he is yet so really no i don't think i'll get in trouble well i don't know if he's new but he is just not well-known especially here i'm sure where he's from everybody knows him because he's really cool so i bet a lot of people are like oh my god i love you yes basically yeah yeah he's really cool he's so powerful you guys should really see what he can do because it's amazing well he can do lots of magic and he can appear out of nowhere that's cool no i can ask him yeah yeah well traveler you heard it yourself if you like everyone here you can just show up anytime well it's possible he's just invisible right now he does that sometimes yeah yeah it happens yeah you know he's just this guy i don't know exactly what he looks like because he's got this hood i imagine that he's really handsome i think he's really cute he sounds really cute he can probably hear me right now i'm so embarrassed (laughter) right maybe he'll start talking to you too oh well he might get-- you know what he might think that's really fun that could be fun maybe you have to get somewhere really quiet because the first time i heard the traveler it was super duper quiet fjord can i ask you a question do you remember how long it took us to get from port damali to the border into-- so wait if i sent a message from alfield then-- or wait where were we when i sent that message then would it have got to nicodranas and to zadash by now okay no i just had an itch-- you have a little dirt on your face but other than that so maybe that's what it is that's why she was going to send it to the pillow trove yeah it would be a pretty expensive package so i feel like-- maybe i could do that i don't know what it is but i'll look into that i have a room there tonight you guys the thing is that apparently it's not easy to get into that district shabby chic maybe we can go somewhere and they will make a coat exactly like that coat with all the same pockets only it won't have the holes in it yeah that's probably good too or we just keep going to visit that guy who made you clean every day we could go see him and then he makes us all clean what to use his power like that i want to ask the traveler if he knows how to do that because i wonder if he could make me do that no i've only seen that guy mm-hmm no they're just unicorns we've got to get to that sewer you guys but we'll have to get clean or else we won't get in there i think they only have to let me in technically i have this key it says pillow trove on it oh yeah beau has it right now so is it better to go now or tomorrow morning late afternoon you said you have an adventurer's kit oh i have an axe now yay yes yeah it's cold hey guys we're about two blocks away from the outer wall we're super close what guard was it that ran away they're probably eaten completely by now oh no but how will we get out what if we get trapped at another one and then we can't get out okay (whistle and intone theme of the good the bad and the ugly) i move to the other side of nott (yells) do you see any monsters down there oh sure wait which one was it what about this one you don't can we come down he locked us in i think a monster would be down i feel like we're walking in a stinky crotch why the traveler liam and do we see any rats down here in the direction of where we came from does that mean we're going the wrong way or the right way ew oh my god i didn't even put it together i just want this is it blood i might throw up yeah you're right we turn around you should probably lick the ground everywhere and see if you taste that blood anymore any webbing perception 21 guys guys look look bring the torch over it's a webbing maybe that would be bad though maybe you should be in the middle have you ever been at a haunted house they come at you from behind i guess i'll be right behind molly yeah i bet that's where we need to go it's blocked (whispering) what is it poke it with your stick how close is it to us we're fighting poop-rats that's what happens when i roll one that i haven't been charging up it just looks wet matt is very committed oh no see caleb look you should've been in the middle of us (chanting) level three oh shit really eight no mine was nine travis and it might've been eight let's just make it eight because i can't remember if i rolled a five or a six you just got bit by a rat running away is it also yellow water matt and fjord why you got to fart while we're fighting oh no that's good i look like i have an unarmed strike too but i don't think i do okay i'm going to run up to the one that just attacked yasha yeah and i'm going to hit it with my handaxe because i'm not very smart that definitely hits that's 21 that's a seven aw you see it was like (strains) no fuck you oh no i think so wait yeah i don't want to use that just yet oh no are there more rats it's really pretty though what a pretty die oh no matt wait how do we know where we're going though how will we choose okay we go that way oh no how hurt is everyone right i should do a cure wounds on you okay i cast cure wounds on yasha that's above your whole-- that's why i said it eight points oh how hurt are you beau oh okay let me know you guys because i've got lots of healing because i'm the cleric i think something's making those things like that oh god what if it's a giant spider and it's infecting the rats (whispering) and they're turning into poisoned-- poison balloons (groaning) i think they're full of pus just really infected rats we should keep going should we be more sneaky or should we just walk we could set them on fire from a distance yeah but what if they all spring up we could just set them on fire okay then let them live and die in horrible pain oh yeah here you go who is the most noisy of us all which one of you fuckers needs some help well here take an advantage just kidding hold on i have to check-- eight not so good let's set it on fire or it could be somebody that's being slowly sucked dry of all their blood should we set it on fire or should we see if it's living is it wiggling at all 15 i think it's dead or it's sedated it's a dog let's cut it down that's good to know that means the human-sized ones are probably fucked up too how long ago did they say the guards went down and didn't come back yeah what if we back up and burn it that's why i said why don't we back up and burn it well caleb how about you send your spectral servant to poke at the little masses of human and see if they start wiggling they'll probably end up as giant pus sacks if they survive i said poke it then if they wiggle then we know that they're alive do it caleb it's unseen i go up and i push it i think your unseen servant farted on me i wonder if the giant spider thing heard that (loudly) i said i wonder if the giant-- you burn that shit then the spider will come and we will burn that shit too i'll stand behind fjord we could take their weapons i bet they're nice weapons or we could return them to the crownsguard maybe they would reward us taliesin and can i take their helmets and put them in my pink bag what about their weapons do they have any does it say anywhere property of the crownsguard how is it to try to chop through it with the axe yeah i want to try doing it and see if it sticks to the weapon or if it cuts through yeah seven (metal plink) except it's covered in webbing so not as much sound can i get my handaxe back thanks caleb it's a dead end past all of this it's a dead end and just goes up it's got to be around here somewhere right should i go up okay is it blocked in and webby all along the ground i stop walking i don't like it either is he reachable (whispered) he's still 20 feet away from me you guys hey fuckers i'm a little worried about walking any further because my feet are starting to stick to the ground like a lot but there's a halfling stuck to the wall over here and i don't think he's dead no i'm 20 feet away from it how close is it to you guys oh no it's an invisible spider we're not invisible those are dead people i see dead people where before it disappeared wait why are all the other things invisible does that mean those are other things that are going to attack us 22 i had a 22 man you always have the shittiest initiative yeah why do you guys always have bad initiative weird i'm up first okay did i hear it happen to fjord did i hear anything oh no i cast spiritual weapon a giant purple lollipop oh no i've got some but you have one too don't you no you have the one don't you have the one that brittany made somebody took a picture of it then disappeared it i make a giant teal lollipop instead here you go directly overhead of where the spider disappeared i'm going to oh god cast sacred flame on the place that it was at can i do that yeah on the place that i saw it it's not invisible guys it's gone i'm going to back up against-- oh no if i back against a wall it's sticky isn't it i'm going to take a couple steps if i can like up on those rocks next to yasha is it yeah yes the spider is in between fjord and beau i thought travis would make the note but he's not where it's relentless yes you have something in your throat molly or did you throw it on the table and matt snatched it up yeah she didn't get a session zero yeah it's blinded okay can i come around the corner and get out of this nastiness ooh it really did stick to it can i see everything okay i'm going to send my spiritual weapon down there to bash it over the head how did yasha get all the way there and my thing didn't get there that's so stupid okay yeah it's only 20 then i'm going to use cure wounds is it touch motherfucker yeah but it's like dog shit aw look at that isn't it so pretty healing word is such dog shit as far as what it can do psh sure whatever i guess i'll do healing word to cure you but you're going to go down again it's not enough to heal you-- oh you are i'm going to-- i'm sorry you guys i'm going to sacred flame it then 1d8 radiant okay aw two yeah it does you should just kill it kill it it's already nervous kill it and don't worry about healing yourself destroy it fjord oh thank god the music on yasha's move yes i'm going to on my turn legerdemain okay how far away are they i'm going to move forward can i get all the way to fjord i'm afraid to get too far away from caleb i'm going to heal you okay good you'll gain seven more than i can heal you because i'm going to cast cure wounds on him sam and yay six points you don't owe me shit i'm going to move my spiritual weapon in the middle closer to beau yeah (screams) (sigh of relief) it died yay we killed it okay no we got all of it off remember 18 no 17 seven damage no don't take it away i'm going to lick it it didn't hit anything it's not even covered with any guts i'm going to go back to the halfling guy that's kind of alive does he look injured at all oh shit can i have grabbed that as i walk over to him can i put my hand on his head and cast cure wounds now 11 blessed child you are alive your saviors have come you don't know how you got down here you didn't come to the sewer on your own no need to scream we're getting you out don't worry do you have a key to the grates can you give us the key thed thed where is the key which pocket is it in i can start digging i start digging through his pockets that's a tattoo you said i rolled an 11 checking through his pockets okay oh no eggs oh no kill it with fire i sacred flame it got to kill them all just keeping all that for yourself then yasha did you say two sets of armor would that fit in the bag would that fit in the bag two sets of armor okay we'll bring these back to the crownsguard and hopefully get some reward is everybody a greedy fuck in this game and we just keep whatever cool vex never lied about the loot we found never once never once for all the shit she got for being greedy she never once lied about the loot she's a terrible half-elf i didn't take anything from you i didn't take anything from his pockets (gasp) yeah it's in the letter his name was thed i didn't take anything from your pockets i really didn't you really do have like a key to the grates like an extra one anything else interesting in the room outside of the bodies aww both i wonder if this grate leads up into the tri-spires then maybe it means lots of rich people are up here maybe easy pickings if they don't allow the criminals in then they'd be real easy to pickpocket because no one would expect it well we can probably call up we have the writ well it's all tied up me and yasha can probably-- sure i put my hands on either side of his face can i see anything weird okay i do i do caleb i don't-- those are really really strong okay but i'm not keeping it just for me you know it's for both of us of course caleb thank you and i'm sorry do you need curing though because your eyes do look bloodshot all right we'll carry it oh my gosh yes because you have a big lollipop to carry up these things into the money pot well somebody that can talk to the guards travis and is it locked can you pick the lock yeah i think it's just two right now hey you guys this is where my hotel is are you trying to figure out if the stores are still open good call i'll get out my disguise kit and put a mustache on the spider it's really bright and shiny in the hotel though should we just make it straight-- just go straight and just stay yeah let's go straight out and leave and go to the crownsguard maybe we should shut the gate up and then lock it so they don't know oh yes don't worry we're staying at the pillow trove but we have this very beautiful writ thank you oh we are really powerful we killed it we took care of the monster problem we're going to clean up we'll be back this is not normally how we dress ugh we were in the sewers the evil monster that was killing everything oh my gosh lots and lots and lots of baby spiders we have armor too of some of your fallen people will you reward us for that thank you beau stop it we're about to get our reward stop being a shithead right now i have them here's two sets of armor and two extra helmets leaky tap at the pillow trove yes what does that mean of course you do i do have a room there i pull out my key i have a room i don't know why it mattered (laughter) just the armor i didn't give back the swords she seemed really nice yes 100 gold i was going to wait until we got somewhere private to do it but sure everyone take 100 gold we all smell like poop yeah but we should probably get cleaned up because they're just going to stop us the minute we get inside should we go and see pumat sol and see if he'll make us clean we're not in the tri-spires anymore we have to get not stinky before we eat okay are we going to bed or are we what we're pretending that there's a bath that's why we should have gone to pumat sol's his letter so i walked in and the guy was like-- you know he had his arms above his head he was chained to the bed right he didn't know where he left the key i know i don't even know how long he'd been there oh people will pay for all sorts of weird things oh hi guys the cult the orgy cult so they offered you money they offered you money to join in don't you think it's stupid to say all of this right here yes how can we be sure he's telling the truth but how do you know that he isn't setting you up to be turned into the crownsguard like kicked to death wait a minute is it wrong to pick wings off flies because that's not-- not if they're already dead then you can pick the wings off super duper easily what's a firefly oh wow oh yeah we can go back to the pillow trove and all hang out and sleep in the same room if you want no it's kind of little actually you guys it's really little actually yeah we all look nice enough they might let us in if not let's all go-- yeah sure we walk back to the guards and i show them the key can we get in all right oh i don't really want to stay in there alone the evening nip does he look like mean at fjord what is his type pretty see fjord you're just so handsome yeah maybe not the best place to celebrate just putting it out there maybe you should ask him about his tattoos since you have tattoos as well like unless we're going to do this we should get out just go back to the leaky tap and then you know this is awful and i don't want it thank you clive bens i know i feel like it's just at home and we can just like-- he's so stinky now that's so cool
