because you're special saturday it is exclusive to gencon the same way we did our exclusive for new york comic-con poster last year oh yeah i just love them so much it smells really good that's long it should be in the chat room it's beautiful travis and i are seeing hamilton this weekend what yeah we really do he's written some fanfiction about it you just wait yeah i did yeah i did what i'm really excited about is that card was at the live show and it is not in my stuff right now but i did no i do however still have my title everything's under control we're alive no yeah trinket tried to kill me but don't worry everything's fine me too keyleth can you open up the trees so our friends can get in aren't we blocked off i was busy looking for my card and i found it hi guys my name is vex'ahlia cool yes we're good can i search for that tea set that i tried to give him cool balls off to a good start ten yeah cool it was a golden cursed tea set there was a big fucking bear you might actually not want to look in that cave because it came out of there and it was rather angry when it did a guardian spirit of the forest yeah would we have heard anything about this in our studies what's in the cave keyleth there was a spirit bear in there it was a big fucking bear yeah trinket popped out and he saved us trinket fucking saved us scanlan what about garmelie would he know hey garmelie what do you know about this fucking bear yeah i'll insight check that little bastard 18 i feel like he would've told us to avoid it maybe we should save our strength for the fucking bow in the tree i really don't think we should mess with this thing how much gold do you have that's it you didn't fight them at all 23 that's disgusting so there was really nothing there what did you really find in there yeah that sounds terrible i wish pike was here she would really enjoy this story i like how all of us sound like we've lost our voice you want me to lick it like healing like you want me to use a whole spell on this teensy-ass wuss cut i cast cure wounds on his little teeny-weeny cut i think we should remember this place is-- well it's probably going to disappear after we walk away these things tend to move don't they we need to focus on the bow and it's really hard to say that but i really-- so stay on it oh we rested so i can take off this negative seven hit points that i don't even remember how i got probably you're right you guide in the front how were you planning to guide us through it if you don't even know how to do it how about you and i we can be in the front duchess of the grape hunt what a wonderful title the only thing i worry about is we made a deal with him he shook our hand right it looks very good on him hold my hand dear 17 eyes out for any things you can always ride on trinket too scanlan i'm going to try to learn from him how he's gauging his surroundings and stuff 21 what does the licking do you're bullshitting so much faith in you definitely the theater natural 20 and i don't even need to roll again what do they do do they just scream a lot oh no 12 oh double-double that's better 25 (whispering) what is that the music do you hear it what does it sound like does it sound pleasant there must be people further in yes do you know anything about music playing randomly in the woods what direction is it coming from it could also be a camp (whispered) ugh i want to see what it is that's doing it though we have to do it regardless yes for a hot second garmelie do you want to come with us go invisible i will hold your hand don't worry dear oh can i cast pass without a trace on us i'm going to do that whoa 28 did she i don't remember i just wanted to see but if you're worried about it we don't have to oh get on up here you stealthy fuck add ten to it because of pass without a trace i cast it on everybody that's within 30 feet of me would have been eight jesus aw fuck okay all right i basically just want to see what the fuck is laughing i want to see what it is what kind of figures fuck fuck this fuck it i'm not doing it no don't fucking go closer i get a really bad feeling all of a sudden i get a really bad feeling about this i'm behind a tree they're totally charmed oh jeez is it a charm effect i take my broom out and i start flying up and i grab scanlan's hand and take him on the broom with me we're going to fucking get vax out of there 23 no don't jump off the broom i'm going to try to pokéball vax into my necklace okay i'm going to try to do that not yet you have to make a wisdom saving throw against me why'd you roll twice it's not charm it was just wisdom then he goes in the pokéball sorry necklace the raven's slumber necklace can i grab scanlan i want to fly down and get him around the waist and pull him out athletics oh that's strength isn't it oh sorry 17 fuck i'm so weak you guys just a regular strength check it's not a saving throw 11 i fly away minor problem it was really a very bad idea to go towards the music however scanlan's enchanted and we should probably save him because it looks like a lot of people have also been enchanted and are stuck there forever if you're going to come and try to save him plug your fucking ears because i have a feeling this music is cursed and i start shoving shit in my ears well then fucking get in there and help him maybe be an elemental and shove some shit in your ears i'm going to let him out of the pokéball before we get him out i'm afraid because of the music's still playing what if you're still charmed i'm not going to dump him out what did what look like it was a camp with bones all over the ground and floating music things dancing there weren't tents just bones yes was there a fire pit there was a single fire pit there was a floating violin and a floating set of drums no don't they actually looked really distraught i think they were under a spell as well i'm going to nock an arrow and point it towards the violin and hold it there but you have stuff in your ears please roll good i feel like we should aim for the instruments are they what did you aim at can i aim at one of the other ones yeah since he shot i want to shoot what else was there drums i rolled 16 15 what the what no it happened when i was saving him against the briarwoods two natural 20s maybe it's time for grog to go in round two grog runs in and grabs scanlan and we run out he can't be charmed i feel like we should let grog go good it stopped we can go back out okay so you're all right scanlan i release my brother he's out of raven's slumber it was the worst play i've ever seen garmelie why didn't you warn us that could happen we trust you dear we should not go back out there best to avoid them let's avoid it we move towards the dusk 25 it gave us advantage-- no i did yeah oh it didn't help i was trying to 36 i think they're here we hope to rid the land of a cancerous tree that has been a blight for a very long time he's not many diseases something else it's our computer we should probably kill it i feel bad for everybody listening maybe just make it come out of your ipad that's how we did it at home man what's trinket doing oh ukurat isn't that the big ghost bear name it they sound really powerful these pixies no we have a very good chance of defeating them we are quite powerful just wondering why you haven't done it before cool hey question should we help you with this terrible problem you've been facing do you think there's any way you would want to help us when we try to take out this cancerous tree it needs to be taken care of teamwork it's really bad whole other area for you to dominate it's quite wonderful goddamn it wait it's my favored terrain natural one that is very agreeable be nice to him trinket all things considered right garmelie scanlan is really charming no but i'd like to try honestly they didn't seem that bad i feel terrible killing them for no reason follow the lights would you want to draw some of the pixies if we see them you can hide behind grog and you draw the pixies they're really that small are they super strong maybe the pixies can help us take out the cancerous tree and all the things around it i'm in a forest that's better 22 how many hours do you have left of reading garmelie won't they see you you should probably just hold onto grog if he runs in just trail behind him they're teeny though it's teeny little houses definitely pixie city is up ahead yes i look for that good idea grog good thinking me too that's not still active anymore 27 and we can't spot any pixies near us at all that would take out the lot of them it seems so drastic he's vex i'm vax that's double because of favored terrain what is that 20 no 33 can you shapeshift into a pixie i like this do we need to let the pixies know that we're going to do this i'm just worried that if you do it then the lycans are going to bust it and then they just go to battle amongst themselves this is actually really smart you've got the mansion what if you do the hallucinatory terrain and we just leave how do you know we cast it and we create a ruckus-- do hallucinatory terrain garmelie which direction should we run if we're running towards where we're supposed to be going all right we take off running-- towards the bog you do it we act like we did something we start running towards the shademirk but keep on the lookout for mandrakes no 31 i'm looking towards where we're going i've got land stride so i don't get slowed by any hard terrain are we going the right direction garmelie what is it seriously a wall hi oh shit fucking destroyed we destroyed their home and then we took off running that's what you wanted right apparently our methods were not complete we will go back and we will do it better this next time wait you're locked in here because of the pixies a little communication is all we need i feel like we need to rest you guys we really need to rest garmelie who do you know that's left these woods your uncle jameson and he was definitely telling the truth that he went in the woods so he knew about the happy camp i guess i fly up can i fly up and see how high up it goes it's a bubble we're in a bubble i go back down yes grog i feel like they weren't that bad of guys they could've attacked us and they didn't they just want out scanlan can you sleep read your book we'll sleep i'll stay up as well we'll take a short rest into a long rest so he can finish reading and then we can sleep and i'm up with him i'm awake i'm keeping guard that's totally tiger-like gross that's foul keyleth if she gets petrified while she's pissing it's going to be-- keyleth keyleth dear shit shit i go and i kick vax awake oi your girlfriend's not back yet she went off prowling as minxie and she's not home fucking a that is not what i meant for you to do scanlan you-- i don't know did you do your hair differently today good you guys are back everybody's safe everything's good if they don't find us can i use my ranger abilities and try to disguise where we're camping i'm going to get a little sleep though so i can get my spells back anybody else taking watch they might've heard you what so we fucking should get out of here wake everybody up at least we can prepare ourselves i wake percival up percy hi grumpy we've been discovered by fairies get ready to use your charming wiles i'm going to let scanlan sleep a little bit more because he looks fucking exhausted all right fine can we make things look fancy around here so when they all come back we look like we're ready to talk to them whitey are you calling him whitey as a nickname what in the fuck is going on here how is this happening i'm going to sit up oh you know what i'm going to put out the little gold tea set and i'm going to act like we're welcoming them to tea whenever they show up i never did actually find out what this tea set does oh you know what and i take out my old wooden music box that i discovered and i wind it up and make some pretty music i like it thank you don't drink out of the teacups because i really think they might be cursed seriously percy i know it's appealing to you but don't get cursed again all right oh good oi scanlan sing a happy tune about how much we love fairies yeah like how pretty they are sounds good too i wasn't quite rested but it was lovely here we've been trying to prepare for your coming unfortunately we don't have very much to make it appropriate i'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding you see we were trying to pass through these woods and we ran into a band of very big very mean-looking wolves which of course we didn't want to do his cut a great mission what are you going to-- okay yes they wanted us to hurt you to destroy your circle of stones yes we're on a very important mission and we thought it might be the quickest way to complete that's really really off-putting understandable but we weren't trying to deal with them in fact we made no deal with them we told them we wouldn't make a deal until we spoke with you but we were scared we were too scared how can we buy his freedom thanks wisher wouldn't you rather have a song wouldn't you rather have-- how often do you get a performance can you quickly-- natural 20 on an initiative i don't know what i can do to them a voltron i feel like it would be easier to hit if it was a giant voltron yeah i know me too they're dicks they were going to take grog grog is on the ground oh he is on the ground yeah we should've but we didn't because we're idiots 27 as well with a natural 20 those fairies are so spread out i thought they would all be together probably i'm going to move over to my left yeah a little bit more i want to line them up in a cone so if i can get as many in a cone as i can it's a 60-foot cone there that i have it's a big cone i want to cast hunter's mark on the shiny one that he hexed as well double they're weak you guys milk jug rings take them out that gets the mamba jamba okay good that's what i want conjure barrage it's a 15 for me so they take half 3d8 halved oh sorry 15 halved plus hunter's mark damage on the-- i got three on that that's one action isn't it so i can't use trinket yet because i already did something i want to duck behind that tree like it's going to do anything you can break that's super bad trinket runs and stands next to keyleth out of camera view they're all super magic super-duper magic we're going to die why'd you do that so you're not a kitty cat grog is stone of course he does oh no and he took out a tree while he was at it you go okay if i step out from behind the tree do i have a sight on the big one can i walk over there then okay i walk to there i want to use my longbow of the sky sentinel and attack it natural 20 12 plus 12 24 and then 22 on the third 20 on the first hit no-- oh shit you double the dice six that's 12 26 plus another five so 31 on the first hit 17 on the second 17 plus five is 22 on the third oh so i shout out two your leader's dead you want to still fight us i move towards the tree that way wow this is the longest-- i thought he was a honey badger he's broken it's stealing all of his energy when you moved the paper you rolled it i'm sorry no he's restrained it's a really powerful pixie fight you get one and you get one and i'm going to fail i got inspiration 21 how many more pixies are there can you poison damage it come on do you have any more luck how many fairies are left i don't see them on the board from where i am i can spot him now because i can see where percy's shooting at right where was it that he was shooting at can trinket reach it then i'm going to attack it can i attack it from where i am i'm going to try to get into sight okay i'm going to attack it 23 then i'm going to attack it again with my blazing bowstring 26 can i move my hunter's mark over thanks man okay seven plus seven 22 on the first hit 24 on the second hit teeny tiny little piece of shit i can't move anymore you're looking good bigby we shouldn't kill it see if it can unfreeze our friends be confident oh no should you add it add it we have some friends that are stone right now maybe you should do that it's not so bad good job grog doesn't feel so good does it hey remember when i was made into stone we're twinkies we have to go finish what we started though they want us to still desecrate the stones did you draw a lot of the fight i hope you did because we kicked some ass there sweet nice very good that tree just moved yes you are a powerful ally is there anything around that looks good to take 23 yeah i know we did kill ferngully they weren't trapping travelers of any kind they were trapping the lycans yeah but then they let us out let's sleep in the mansion tonight but you can't yeah let's sleep up in the trees tonight before we make our way into this area you realize it's only been an hour since we slept last but it's all nighty no but
