you're in that picture too matthew no you were not is that part of announcements you mother-- wow so we can hear about it (gasps) do you really can we know what you took no that's got to be a surprise oh you don't have to choose fucking rangers no you didn't i took the second level in rogue though i don't get any rogue spells but i do get to disengage now we're still in the house i'm a little nervous that the trap that went off on the front door was an alarm system for whoever left yeah but we saw a trail of blood leading to the front door no i think it was the blood from-- i think i mean i think that it was-- she's been fucking tracking us because you already went up to the top before i leave the room can i check to see if it seems like ripley was alone or if there were other people natural 20 all right grog can i have some of that dust of tracelessness definitely can i sprinkle it around so that they can't track us in the room having been here definitely not as bad a felony as shoving spice up your ass but yes yes yes and get ready to leave because we can't hang around-- can she hear us when you scry can you hear yeah so if we're talking about her right now she can hear-- you're a piece of shit you're ugly he won't shoot it he'll sit on it is there a safety he won't trinket sit on the bed if anybody walks in the room that's not one of us well make them very scared and make sure they-- (laughs) shoot them with the gun don't you fall asleep don't you fall asleep grog okay yeah the ball yeah that i gave you just the one ball though the ball of seeing the ball of scrying we'll talk to treev percy we'll find her i'm going to go sit with you while you scry trinket so we're not in the room with trinket trinket you keep doing your thing all right let's go back to the other room and let's get something else to-- do you want one i have a bag does that dice go to dice jail she's fucking finding another one i thought the gun was under the bed with trinket whisper's in the ocean the dagger fuck can we instantly be in the middle of the ocean with her is she mist into the ocean of course yes grog that's a very scary place especially imagine if one of us was wearing all of the vestiges she's not going to give it up could she be the one letting the dragons know about-- could she be the spy fuck why didn't we kill her when we had her in our-- are we by the ocean at all can misty step travel faster than a boat so if it took her a week to get where she is now we could probably get there-- we don't necessarily drown immediately we could bomb her will we be able to find her in the middle of the ocean no you can scry up yeah maybe somebody in an airship we'll keep scrying until we see if she's found it into the plane of abyss he wants whitestone he's going to know do you have green gems no but the green gems from whitestone no but here's the thing maybe somebody did see her not five days but we don't have to fly we just have to teleport there but we don't have a plan we have five days to figure out how to fucking kill a dragon oh jesus potentially treev is treev downstairs treev we need to talk to you it's rather urgent we found her body in her home about a week ago i think we had nothing to do with it we could've left town your mistress has-- had a very powerful item on her it's why we sought her out as well from what i could see her attackers were not alone there were five of them oh shit treev-- i put dust of tracelessness on the ground in her home plus you know what exactly your man has seen a dead body before he's going to be able to tell that it's been there for a while (laughs) that we would come to hire her after we had already-- specifically an airship of sorts-- thank you oh really it's a much easier enchantment 750 or if you have a need of gems we have gems so many things you should call your enchanter an hour kynan payment but we don't even know what he's doing yet of course i don't know what we're going to have him do that's all how about these two beautiful sapphires they're quite lovely and-- and i pull out a giant raw ruby as well 200 each for the sapphires and the ruby is 150 it's only a hundred gold short that is the most valuable necklace (yells) scanlan you should try the dice game just once yeah isn't this the seven or the twelve game i know i feel like the minimums should go down in the middle of the day double down yeah okay all right i'm here mm-hmm well we're going to be above her maybe we can be the one to drop something heavy regardless of what he makes who wields it fenthras is a horrible weapon wielded by a horrible being before i had it a gun can do the same thing well i'm interested in seeing it is this thing you're building going to kill a lot of people in addition to the dragon percy if you had stayed with her and let the briarwoods go a god a terrible god would probably be loosed on the land right now i think you chose correctly oh keyleth really hold off of the alcohol we have a lot to do today please get her some fresh air percy you're a better man than you believe no it doesn't shit wait what what the fuck did you do did you really did you steal it tell me you didn't do anything-- that's great right now oh the enchantment right we're waiting on that that's why we're fucking here shall we bring the weapon down there yay then trinket's with us again so he looks totally trustworthy scanlan he seems like the type you might want to try selling him some of that fusaka can i insight check him 19 we need to remove the enchantment from it if we can remove the enchantment if it takes a long time to transfer maybe you can keep transferring it after we've left is that a thing great what really that fast you are very powerful you you wouldn't be able to identify something for me would you you seem so smart is all darling we're already here please oh damn it i will pay you how much do you want just to identify something that's all dear 100 gold darling it seemed effortless for you to do that before is it hard fine fine shit fine a hundred gold whatever i just want to know can you look at this please it's a tea set it's gold isn't it beautiful it's so good we didn't drink from it lovely thank you so much of course dear that guy was weird and potions of healing saaba and what they'll give a good deal potions i need healing potions who needs healing potions okay scanlan can you come with me can we find a hand of ord i want to talk to him we're not making a street deal right now we met with j'mon sa ord earlier we have their blessing 18 yeah we're in need of some healing potions i'm assuming as a guard of the city you have access to quite a few some greater healing potions would be wonderful of course six regular thank you so much your aid is appreciated be pleased vox machina and then i want to buy like three more greaters can i say i haggled shut up natural 20 all right three more greater healing potions sounds good can i insight check him 27 yeah darling we all have off days we're about to leave we can i won't tell anyone i give him 50 that's for lying to me all right minus 1100 yes let's go get on the boat i turn around and wink at him as i go up also thank you backblaze wait before we do that we forgot to mention at the top of the show there's only one week of preorder left on the bracelets and the pins he's wearing the bracelet i know you did i heard you but you know in case people were drowning you out and then we also have the limited items which we only have a little bit left in the store the nail wraps and the patches that were limited edition at comic-con that are still there i think still in the store so yeah the rings and the rings the spinning rings okay sorry don't throw up again 22 the one that i harpooned wow well we vouched for her at the time we're super powerful no we'll stick with the shrew was that hard for you grog do you think this is where they knocked thordak down didn't they fight thordak in the ocean i'll do that i'll sleep out and trinket will want to do that as well stars trinket beautiful we'll have two scrys tomorrow if you learn the spell but it's in the ocean isn't it and we're very high above it i want to hold fenthras in my hand and keep thinking about the things saundor said can you scry again immediately that's how long the spell lasts how many people can you cast it on that's sick don't be a green dragon you know i thought it was a possibility but this is the first time i'm sure your girlfriend is way cooler than you i do some sunbathing they're going to be coming out any minute unless they're already out could we shoot the boat from above and destroy their escape yes right so we wait until she drowns and then we take it from her i wonder if she hired the boat or if it's hers i would hate to kill innocent crew members can you cast water breathing on us before you fly down and that way-- or is that going to fuck up your spells 24 hours so just in case we end up in the water we're not fucked i can be death from above on the broom yes yes we need to double check that this is actually the boat can you cast a spell just in case shit happens as soon as we get close enough to the ship no the spell the breathing spell me she told me all about it 25 it looks like the boat's been docked there for a while a camp on the shoreline is it close by the boat can you scry and see if she's still underwater or if she's camping because i see smoke well i guess you don't need to now there's people on the boat waiting still but you should probably cast breathing but cast breathing on us first yes i do once we get close enough are they seeing us do they look like they're looking over the sides of the boat 20 no they don't look like they're looking over the side of the boat yeah it's a flare okay okay shit i can fly there on my broom but i don't fly very quickly a pterodactyl three more minutes of scrying still maybe the scrying was ill-timed oh jeez i ready the broom i get on the broom and wait well you can hop on his back anybody that comes on board lock them up immediately i tell trinket to hop in the necklace because we're going to be traveling very quickly dear she's still scrying we can they might be by the ship i shoot the arrow and try to get to the boat the oracle arrow oh come on was it underwater can you at least tell that much fuck good times who are you shooting oh i thought he already ran under while this is happening can i have taken a flying run off of the airship and started flying toward the smoke the campfire yeah percy make sure the airship stays far away from these boats i don't want ripley having any access to the airship can i get a closer look at the campsite is there anybody that i can see around it from above yes 30 then no i wanted to fly down a little closer and see if i can see any footprints and see where they lead i hope so because i love those commercials
