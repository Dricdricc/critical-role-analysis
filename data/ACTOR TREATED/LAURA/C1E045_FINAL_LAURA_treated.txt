epilsode they care about that yes i saw it's so good marisha it's really funny wait are we supposed to be at that yes that's when we-- i can't say i'll talk to you guys afterwards secret secret go check geekandsundrycom go to their store right now because they're up and it's so awesome and i can't wait for you guys to see we have a gilmore's glorious goods t-shirt (cheering) as well as the gilmore's glorious goods t-shirts we also have exclusive critical role d20 rings spinny rings those are limited so if you get them then snag them fast because they're going to be gone i think they said they were going to set us aside some they'd better why don't we have them right now at intermission maybe we can grab them at intermission and the d20 when you crit succeed it's a critical role logo just putting that out there whatever those guys are stupid this has nothing to do with announcements but i want to only roll green dice tonight for saint patrick's day it kind of counts marisha we haven't actually slept yet then it's late we did oh i didn't know if we camped i thought we talked is lady allura here no well she was on her way to westruun and we haven't heard from her yet yes but she knew it she was going in secret wait there's a dragon there kima a very large one and she was being very very stealthy-- we'll wait kima going in loud will only cause more trouble she should be here by then maybe somewhere safe like right here-- yes the castle so we're healed up we are healed we are not running the risk of dying at any moment because we've been healed right it's a special occasion she's on her way to a tavern kima's drinking it up grog kima's drinking it up it did kill me according to you thanks grog helpers actually they're going to be here for a while hopefully two objects what was the second there was oh i must have missed it because i was dead that's right no actually a trap that percival set off is what killed me what what what what what what so these vestiges these leathers these things it was worn by one of her champions the great purvan yeah i think i like it but i'll just look at it it's leather you choose which one my armor's acid-resistant i sort of stole it from my brother do you want your acid-resistant armor back then he's in such a sour mood lately what is it it's like tequila there's a being it's a being is it a soul gem but something's already in there it was buried with-- oh that's really smart to give to scanlan this is maybe the worst thing that scanlan's ever held outside of that gun that you had percy it was buried with the raven queen's champion i mean it could be incredibly dangerous or it could be incredibly good and he trapped it and they're bad right they are so beautiful i do like feathers (sniffs) like (sniffs) must and mold and birds really yeah he already told us about it well let me look at my book you know what i like about this particular piece of paper is that you made it on cardstock so it's extra special instead of the regular paper i'm talking to matt bitches okay i forgot what i was going to say-- oh my book my 30-gold book does it say anything about what purvan fought like trinket (gasps) galdric what yeah what if it touches the thing and it-- an ally of purvan an ally of purvan's is purvan a good guy i thought the raven queen was not good yeah with these green dice it's like a poké ball right it's like a pokémon i think we should do it in the forest outside of vasselheim all right yeah let's do it woods okay is that close to your family oh let's do it all right sure let's do it all right what do you think good idea good idea we're healed yes no we did we didn't rest since then yeah we need to sleep y'all i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself but it's four in the afternoon there's other things to do today like find out how gilmore's doing and see pike i'm going with you yeah i lean up against the bar next to you guys for a couple hours we saved your life and the entire town ooh good call what did you see is she all right did you see the dragon gatshadow could you communicate with her when you scry i don't know how it works all right we left word and told her we were coming here yes if you wait she'll be here drake uriel gilmore's glorious goods wonderful place to buy all sorts of products if it were still standing yes maybe yes tofor which one is tofor yes tofor-- they did i think tofor is-- definitely maybe here yes oh they're not actually here then yes they're looking for other survivors tofor and asum oh shit you don't know anything thordak big terrible red yes you defeated him once he escaped the fire realm actually keyleth-- i shut the door behind kima i want to talk to you i would ask my brother but knowing him he would walk away what happened look at me keyleth be strong you're royalty tell me what happened i grab both sides of her face and force her to look at me i'm all right i'm still here okay i need you to tell me what happened because between us vax is off something's wrong and i need to know what it is yes how did i get back who brought me back kashaw zahra my brother anyone else sit down there's a bed sit down percy helped like we did with pike his wife okay fluttery words here darling get to the point why vax did he get hurt as well no what did he do right well it's rather suiting isn't it yes keyleth thank you dear and i leave okay okay okay okay (laughter) foul that would probably be smart i'm pretty tired after dying so i'm going to go to sleep i bring trinket into the castle with me just so you know it's hard it's hard vax is that you i open the door shit 22 damn it and horses when was the last time you showered keyleth they caught it that one caught it well i open my door and find my brother falling through it oh good morning comfortable bed i see yeah it's confusing all these all these doors i have no idea my nature check tells me it's roughly i dunno eight nine something like that seven maybe seven it's not like i did it on-- all right i can't breathe you're about to kill me again so-- (laughs) i heard a rumor that you sort of saved my life in a really creepy sort of way i talk to people i talk to so many people i find out things secrets aren't safe when vex is around wait wait wait i have a present for you because i feel like you're going to really like it would you like it i have this armor that i think would be really great on you do you want it it's really expensive if you don't take it quickly i might change my mi-- oh that was expensive cardstock (laughter) all right i love you let's get breakfast careful it smells a lot like must and mold and birds he stole it what can i say he is a really sneaky stealthy kind of guy yeah fair and square where's pike we should bring her with us can we bring pike with us i know she's taking care of gilmore but we need some sort of somebody that can heal i think we've learned this for ourselves (sighs) okay we learn nothing carry on no the caves i thought we were going to the-- primeval awareness (radar sounds) i like it oh there's so many things i could sense sirens sure harpies six miles what about if i sit for one more minute and i think if i can sense any giants okay well i mean clear of the things i checked for no giants were they both empty i don't remember all right sure cave oh if we stick to the woods it's my favored terrain if we go into a cave not as much just barely do we have any buff spells or some shit that we should cast to make us cooler aww put it on it's useful what yes dear what is this okay breaking hearts left and right i kiss him on the cheek thank you percy is that a black eye huh this is lovely i can't wait to use it yeah definitely let's all surround it and make sure we're not all clumped up this was somebody's pet all right it's probably not smart enough to take control of our minds yeah yeah yeah all right i like it it only gets to see scanlan i'm going to stealth yeah scanlan's going to talk to it natural 20 trinket don't stand next to me it gives it away go stand next to keyleth and trinket's next to you trinket be nice-- oh (whispers) i'm natural 20 that still didn't see me aw can i use my perception can i sneak i do get advantage because of my cloak sweet i'm stealthing damn it 19 hey it doesn't can i see it better now to perceive it if i help my brother get on the armor will it happen faster i help him put on the armor well you're not the same size as the other guy he can dress faster the rustle of feathers trinket totally understands you no we need to get more t-shirts in stock that needs to happen but there is still the critical role logo t-shirt available what is happening what is he-- is the ring still available if the ring is still available check out our ring i push vax forward (whispers) that's a bad idea for dogs (whispers) it's gonna bite your face off give him some chocolate man (whispers) what's his name taliesin and galdric i pull out one of my treats i have for trinket wait wait trinket-- this is for your buddy galdric galdric i throw the treat and say hey whoa is it good is it good we plan on having him help us kill some dragons trinket hides very well when dragons are around good yeah i like it it'll make the wolf vomit trinket goes up and starts eating it oh you know what i have by the way i still have like a cooler bag of holding that we got from the slayer's take like it keeps things cold yeah it's like a little bitty one but it keeps parts from going bad totally well he'll follow grog i suppose i threw a treat at it i don't understand leave it the fuck on it's really expensive what do you want to damage it (quietly) fuck he doesn't appreciate presents he doesn't have any other armor i took his armor no tell him not to attack villagers do it in a really aggressive way though keyleth stern no he'll probably attack you or he'll bone you matt's like mm-mm yeah i remember (whispering) grog go stand behind her have him guard the village just fucking tell him to do it protect these lands (laughs) he already asked that as long as we need you to approaches yeah you can awesome bye buddy man that's a cool-looking wolf what is that what is that you have what is that and we can carry him around and then pop him out wait okay wait is it going to hurt him does it hurt him is it like it's bad okay i'm going to try it and i'm going to try it and just to see how he likes it if he's okay with it hey buddy come here what was that trinket what did you eat don't eat the puke do not eat the puke come here trinket do you want to go for a ride you like rides yeah you want to go for one all right sit still this'll be fun i don't know how to use it i point to him with the-- by the power vested in me i now pronounce you my pokemon (laughter) is he about this size but i don't like that one is he about this size oh it's a little crystal (gasps) oh my gosh that's really fun okay how do i let him go i release you how was it did it hurt can you talk to him you can still talk to him talk to him ask him if it hurt well that's not good ask him how he's doing ask him how the little car ride was ask him if he liked the ride okay would you mind ask him if he'd mind doing that on occasion you know whenever i need him to ask him if he cares if i do it again ask him if he cares what did he say what did he say he looked really cute when he said something oh buddy i go and hug him really tight and scratch his ears --vomit on i don't even care oh my gosh thank you this is the best this is the best and we can travel with him we can climb with him we can sneak around i know it's great oh my god oh my gosh okay don't we need to--oh yeah we need to check in on keyleth's family grog's family no but that's down-- yes that's over by grog's family they were by kraghammer allura should be here in like a day she should be here very soon we should go to the fire ashari (laughs) do you need some water yeah let's get some meat yeah he does put it on oh plate armor none of us can wear it but pike okay i have this which i can't wear it's a purple and black robe it was lady briarwood's robes clings to nearby darkness as you walk while wearing this robe you gain resistance to piercing damage anybody need pierce resistance that can wear robes what about gloves of missile snaring that appeal to anyone these gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them and when a ranged weapon attack hits you you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your dexterity modifier provided that you have a free hand if you reduce the damage to zero you can catch the missile if it's small enough to hold in that hand it requires two no it just requires one free hand yes it does it requires attuning anybody i feel like that could be cool for you scanlan oh and bring them here should we wait for allura then before we go they've been there for a while already then they're surviving wait for allura hopefully she'll be here by then that's next i've got an opal dagger you could have used or in the morning i have a plan keyleth we will cover the 1000 gold from our own party funds and have someone here mine some shit for us and give it to us later percival do you have people here who can mine looking for work people-- yeah it is so maybe we should take 1000 gold just from your family stores then huh that might be smarter oh we do no that's 500 that was just 500 just so you know no it was just 500 isn't he though (laughs) no no no do something really nice for me dear dear dear i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry do nice things all right you're right they're taking on so many people let's just use the damned party funds for the time being it's fine keyleth this is a really important feast all right what just want to make sure we feast right before we leave so that it's most useful oh that was a good night's sleep i tell you what oh hey good morning keyleth can anybody else make a feast that's here (sighs) i miss pike no i'll cook breakfast no i won't cook breakfast are you summoning breakfast and then you're sleeping and then we're leaving and then you're sleeping
