campaign-- look at that opening it's so cool looking oh that's a little door that's the door you we're talking about how old is the child that got pulled out of the room i'll be behind fjord what do we see though frumpkin size or smaller did you see that i saw that radiant blast sacred flame i mean don't hit the kid but you can't see beau oh this is for the whole thing if i'd have known that i would have rolled better for the whole thing i wasn't trying so hard ten oh no oh no ah you're going to hold your turn roll again because you might get natural 20 roll again for advantage you might get a 20 did you find it i'm not beau i'm beau number two i lied i am not going to do the sacred flame i'm going to do toll the dead because that's a wisdom saving throw to the one holding the kid that's a wisdom saving throw aw he saves (rasping) next time i'm going to really hurt you i said that in infernal i've got to see this dice as you roll it you weren't even rolling those dice yes the field is ours now now it's a horror movie i was trying to help that's great oh okay i'm going to move forward into the room to about yeah there's good sure i'm going to try it again did the guy up there get hurt at all yes then i'm going to cast toll the dead at him fucking a piece of shit it's 13 because i'm lame i'm going to start unsnapping my sickle to get it out to hit things oh no so cool will the hyena get a bite on the kid children have no hit points (singing) hyenas will bite them yes okay did i see the child go down okay then i am going to run over to the kid no all these other people are helping this kid so i guess i will too somebody better kill that big gnoll though i don't i don't care but now i feel guilty should i use my last spell on this kid i'm going to use a healer's kit to stabilize him the whole time i'm grumbling like oh i could have gotten that last toll of the dead it would have heard a really good bell and instead i'm doing this (laughter) oh no oh my god caleb needs glasses a new prescription glasses make you smarter your scarf will protect you oh no i should have tolled the dead on him someone bring me those ears and bring them to my jar how many gnolls was that we just killed we only sent one down the hole right and then one hyena set do you see what i'm doing oh i saw your bird (whispering) the grand duchess can you heal do you have healing because i'm stabilizing him don't worry but-- and some doughnuts i take one and push it onto his face we're working on it on a scale from one to ten what are you wearing it's a poop hole he's probably covered in really old poop shaft oh speaking of i stand up and i walk to the door where the little kid was pulled from are there any ropes across the door i knock on the door housekeeping is anybody locked in here i think it's the mom okay (turning noise) yes definitely he's alive don't worry are there any other people that are alive that you know of oh can we run over to the other door but he's alive we're the rescue party bad timing they're safe there do you have a cart to get them back to alfield all of us together like a big party i like it yeah the good bell not the bad bell no let's do it let's throw them down the hole now they all look like they just left and had some-- you know sometimes accidents happen yeah let's search around how many dead bodies do you think i could carry i'm going to try to drag some of the dead out-- you need glasses though oh nearsighted i understand as we're walking them nott's going through the pockets i'm dragging the bodies going duchess duchess stacy please come over to me duchess stacy grand duchess stacy two i stabilized him i stabilized him real good ooh i could give someone a blessing who's shitty at this blessing roll a 20 with advantage fuck oh jesus oh that's where you came from keep checking for traps okay oh the grand duchess and frumpkin will be best of friends i feel like we're seeing more of caleb's social awkwardness seeing him from the outside it's so good it's really smart that he made a hummingbird that's really fast it's a pretty smart move don't you think yeah i mean it's really smart did you see any survivors maybe he's sleeping offer her shiny things then i give you a blessing of the trickster for your stealth you get advantage fjord we can't hear you you're fucking 60 feet ahead of us should we go down the tunnel or should we go to them then it would add another hour up there wouldn't it i don't really get anything back on short rest i mean there might be more survivors we rescued some survivors we took a rest yeah under short rest not hit-- you can do it i go running past them right as they do it and cut its ears off thank you oh okay i do that 15 do they see us 16 (whispering) there's a lot more guys out there i saw three visually oh god this means that-- that would be amazing oh no they're coming (whispering) they were about to look in this direction but they weren't quite looking in that direction when we dragged the body out fjord what do we do can you send the grand duchess in did she used to be a person and you shrunk her down oh no you can shake the ground though he saw the bird come back this way so maybe-- liam and do you know how to do that sam and let's fucking go i rub her head and give her a little blessing don't you worry you keep hiding whenever you need it it gives you advantage on stealth checks not surprised i could sacred flame him in the exact same time i pull my sickle out so i'm prepared for actual up-front combat which one do you want to hit the orange one the gray one or the black one we can't see those guys to sacred flame them we could get the one in the back and then the other two might look at him let's do it i knew it was blur at the same time i see his little reed flick i'm going to swirl my sickle around and cast toll the dead it's a dex save for sacred flame and a wisdom save for toll the dead 13 you couldn't have them roll that for me i really love crystal pepsi ugh that's okay it was for visual anyway ten i got ten oh fjord right as we all ran in at the same time i'm going to move forward up to the other side yeah can i see them you know what fuck it should i do this marisha and fuck it i'm going to climb up the stairs then i'm going to invoke duplicity it's going to appear next to the-- yeah right there she's going to be like-- yeah and then can i use my movement to crouch behind this table okie dokie okay oh shit oh no it's the general we are outgunned doesn't hit me 17 i put my shield up what is aid me

run-- oh god there's three of them right there i know but-- what am i going to do i'm going to run into-- oh no that's really dumb i'm going to use my duplicate and she's going to toll the dead to the orange one travis and it's a wisdom saving throw roll low this is a really loud gong he takes four damage the orange one oh had he not been damaged yet i shouldn't have rolled a 12 i should have rolled an eight six damage as a bonus action i did that so i'm going hop up on the table that i'm next to yeah shak√§ste stay forever come get me you coward it's fine you're just going to die (glumly) i know what he rolled don't say those things marisha you can do it oh god drop his weapon no don't listen to me do what you want yeah that's pretty good he keeps his weapons in his hand though could they tell it was my illusion right there damn it oh oh i'm going to take it can he not react either okay i'm going to run forward and attack him because he's not moving at all yeah 16 four points of damage it was you laura and yeah we do wait what kind of weapon was that guy holding that's really big you got up wait not the pulp we need the ears that's three gnoll sets and i'm going to mark one as super special because it's big yeah thanks wyrmwood thanks for marisha no congratulations marisha rummage through their bodies i did i know i'm doing that (yelling) did you see that that is not cocked i rolled a one and a two so yeah a three for investigation i'm going to take it how heavy is it who wants this gold anybody yeah here is three gold for you here is three gold for you there's seven gold left here's three gold for you three gold for you i've got one gold left how much silver did you say there was we got all the ears should we search for more survivors and then burn it to the ground yeah well we can explode it you mean search for people mine's 13 what should we do what should we do i think that means he ate him don't think it's going to help should we go in i meant it's-- what are we doing we're level three what are we doing we got to go in we got to throw some dynamite get the people out and run we got two sticks and we steal the baby yeah we might kill the mom though or bury it let's get it out and then collapse the tunnel leading to it then they can get stuck in this room we have one and one we should make our way towards this though they're going to get to the next hostage by the time we get to this room cause we're 100 feet away from it still start walking stealthily who needs a blessing caleb you need a blessing you're shitty at stealth right i bless you oh they're real close to them i'm in the back we get the guards out we get the people out oh we're all going to be in there you need to sneak in and you need to try to unhook the ropes okay you stealth around they won't even know that you're there while we're attacking untie the guards and then we all run spiritual weapon is really good if you have that that's very badass i know but then i have no spells left i got a first level y'all she should sneak in before you do spiritual weapon otherwise it's going to make them aware that something's going on the spiritual weapon will definitely alert them to our presence yeah you make that spiritual weapon appear right next to them you can hit them immediately you do it right when we do the surprise attack you sneak in yeah are you good to sneak i'm going to bless you before you go sneaking around the side you get advantage when you go into the room just in case of a natural 20 13 caleb what's your stealth roll okay come on nott go all the way around got nothing they might see you you're getting really close to the manticore i'll stand next to caleb on the inside yeah 18 i'm going to run around to the other side of it this is so dumb yeah i'm going to hit it with my sickle or whatever natural one oh no i'm going to just dance in place hits me i'm going to cast hellish rebuke at it as soon as it does it it doesn't say on my thing it's a dex save oh 3d10 i'm going to say in infernal-- i'm going to say-- no 3d10 because it's cast at 2nd-level when you're doing hellish rebuke okay 13 yeah in infernal i say oh you're such a cute kitty oh no do we get an attack of opportunity ah i'm going to kick it no i don't hit it i rolled a three he done been paralyzed (singing) two steps forward-- oh the spell spiritual weapon stays on the field once you cast it it's out there in every single turn for a bonus action you can attack don't give-- let him decide can you do anything while you're paralyzed okay i'm going to sacred flame the priest sacred flame is a dexterity saving throw yeah doesn't matter still hit six damage of radiant pink energy is hold person concentration oh i can move oh yeah that's right i could run down and grab my sickle why not oh that's right they can't just move i'm going to run up and engage the priest get the baby does the spiritual weapon get a-- oh my god (gasp) grab fjord and get out of here i know i'm going to cast-- i'm going to cure you unconscious 17 exact amount you have one of the healing potions no spiritual weapon can move 30 feet oh maybe i'm wrong liam and man hit the fucking priest that's good because that gets me up and i can heal you six plus two eight it's all going to shit thank you i stand up i'll reach out and cast cure wounds on nott yes it is sorry eight points to heal then i guess we should start running yes i use the remainder of my-- can i use my bonus action to dash my bonus action to whimper a little bit i'm hoping the priest is lame oh that's just mean hideous laughter does that mean we all get advantage on hits now but you guys we've got a whole other round for at least a whole round and each time he takes damage oh i thought it was like a paralyzation sort of thing laugh it up fuzzball what what's this mean what that's right nine plus five with advantage why with advantage you got healing in there you could do a cantrip as an action because you got enough distance yeah 1d8 radiant don't touch it i wonder if that makes spells better (gasps) yay find all the shit this is so exciting i'm going to walk up and pet the manticore's mantle what was that we should get out of here should we get out of here i guess anything else in the chamber does it look like there's any other little interesting things in there yeah well i'm still here with this big giant manticore head so-- you guys got caleb i think it might be easier to put it on the cart i mean if it's all slow then it doesn't matter i can walk alongside it and pull the manticore head we should probably just get there the saviors of alfield have returned it's a manticore head oh fuck we're still a-- i pull out the jar of ears (laughter) they heard it he's the coolest you're so epic do you have a present it's so pretty it was up will's butt i can't believe we survived nott the brave
