technically he wasn't part of the performance technically he was saving everyone technically well technically we just all met technically we're a group you guys (laughter) great i really like it here so that's good that we get to stay so long her accent is really strong it's hard to not match her accent (laughter) they're not with us do you think it was the little girl what happened oh i thought you didn't like jails so should we go in and try to get her out okay we'll follow her in she was also helping to save a lot of people big misunderstanding i know isn't it so weird it smells like caleb down here (laughter) i know why doesn't she get to talk to the lawmaster what do you mean oh no are you guys making fun of her because of her spasm she's a very calm person i've never seen her angry ever it was an adopted sister i was helping she's staying at the same place that we are do you need me to heal that marisha (through gritted teeth) no for the cause do it for the cause yeah the big zombie beast especially was using a lot of like sticks and stuff to attack people more than any kind of mouth (laughter) like at all during the day even just a question if we wanted to shop or something not okay cool it is really beautiful here but i think i'd rather stay at the inn you should have spasmed a couple times on the way here yeah opportunity missed she's a dwarf she's human oh
