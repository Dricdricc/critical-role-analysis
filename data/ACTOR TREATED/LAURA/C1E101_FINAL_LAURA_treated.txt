the merchandises well you know we do have that amazing david mack poster it is actually but it's available for three more weeks the signed version is available for two more weeks and since it is a limited-time release thing if you know anybody that watches the show but is maybe way behind and they're not watching live it would probably be nice to let them know about it because i still get some messages about the joe mad poster that people can't get anymore so it will be gone after this so it's nice if they can get it too and we have the scanlan tee and we have our amazing slayer's take aprons slayer's cake aprons we have the amazing scanlan concert tee and you know a bunch of other t-shirts as well and a whole bunch of other things go check out the shop on geekandsundrycom and you'll see all of the merchandise that's available as many of us as possible who don't want to look at our faces an old ally what should we do next what does the next step on this journey mean for us no but really what should we fucking do should we go through it doty's gone again that's true that would be smart we have another entrance we have the one in whitestone it could be the same portal or they could both be within view of the tower yeah they do the same thing that's assuming there's only two i can try but in whitestone there was at least a visual path toward the ball but i don't think there is one here is there not within the magic orb what if we collapse the one in whitestone at least try to block off the entrance to where they can't get out what if we block this one and then we block the one in whitestone and then we just-- i think we win then right so there are three entrances that we know of and we need to block all of them there's one up top that we heard about oh yeah did we rummage through the bodies let's rummage through those bodies is there anything on the bodies whoa that was high 23 we'll take those we can take the plate armor if there's room for it in the bag and then see if it's actually magical outside of the field all right and we already had two so now all of us have one he likes to save his bodies for later let's not do that let's not go through that hole we can try it's all that ale grog all right so now we have seven of those things and we have to get eight of us through you and you bitch yeah and you're here with us now scanlan i haven't seen you do it tary what do you think is doty the brigade right well have tary identify them maybe it's something specific outside of the field do you have any more identify left can we have you identify the plate armor that the big guy was wearing so we can see if it's magical so it's immune to pike just good gods i think i have so many things wait hold on chod there's-- oh chod do you want a jewelry box that makes music do you it makes music you like music i'll mark that off wait wait is that the clarota one that is the clarota one wasn't it you're giving the clarota thing the resistance-to-mind stuff because we could maybe use that yeah there's maybe a grog in the group that could totally use it i know so maybe you should remember that you have it and give it to fucking grog i didn't know you had it no i'm just saying if grog has resistance to mind control then that would be really good for us in a fight with somebody that's really powerfully-- i didn't know it required attunement not everybody has a bag of holding grog we just give him everything okay okay okay how do we collapse these tunnels-- well that's true i'll do that from outside and i feel like we're going to run into traps if we try to find it from this way maybe find it from the outside and just collapse it that way we don't have to go through a series of shit yeah just in the tunnels maybe do you want to go up and see if we can find the thing up top it's daytime now right outside so can me and keyleth go try to find the entrance up top so we can do something to that one matt sure okay just earring us if something happens oh my gosh how cute would that be oh god don't drop pikeys yeah there's that whole other path there's that whole-- there's that whole other path and then the one up top but i could hear a rumble so i know you guys did good on one of those paths already (retching) the spins just a couple of sticky warriors yeah up top both of us are looking for it we're flying up can you fly so we can fly up i was going to help you look for it because i figure you have a better ability to collapse it than i do a goldfish of course you can yes put your arms around me keyleth i know i work out a lot same thing 21 i hover down near it but don't get off the broom oracle arrow down the hole oh wait can she set the end of it on fire aww let's just fucking collapse it well just you fucking collapse because i can't do shit to this thing into it into it or just around it so you collapse the-- oh god keyleth fuck fuck i get out the rope of entanglement and hover close to the surface and start hanging the rope down that's fucking crazy careful of traps though keyleth because i'm sure there's something in there up here fabulous our friend keyleth is amazing yes she did don't hit any traps don't fuck with anything keyleth just collapse it what do you see keyleth wait you're looking down at the ziggurat get the fuck away from it keyleth we still don't know how far that field goes if you turn into keyleth again you're fucked get the fuck out i'm holding my rope for her you don't-- okay good job are you going to stay that way or are you turning back into you so that i can get you on the broom you can still talk right you just sound low crazy hey guys how's it going what should we do make some medicine tary are you coming back to whitestone a very good book lionel is it good how are you doing yeah are you coming back to whitestone as well scanlan i mean aes-- is he coming back okay through the tree then let's gather our troops find out what they've learned we asked cassandra to gather people to study the shadowfell as soon as we did the oracle arrow last time so it would probably be smart to find out what they've learned before we make our plans and we have far less time than we would have imagined is ryndarien here we need to get everyone away from it i'm going to run down to the ziggurat and try to get eskil ryndarien away from it and warn everyone to stay away from it eskil oh yes i'm a lady now well i hate to be the bearer of bad news but i'm afraid being down here isn't safe anymore plenty of work up top away from this orb of death it's very dangerous we've discovered it's a gateway and things can come through it and there might be armies coming through because we just fought somebody on the other side of another ziggurat she changed it did you know that siphons can be changed it changed from one color to another because i was there to witness it in ank'harel and it looks the exact same as this one i agree fabulous you're so agreeable i do love talking to you the big ornate bed i have wonderful hearing yes that's terrible can you look at this armor really fast and make sure that it's not actually cursed or anything was it cursed or anything when you looked at it would he have known from the identify spell if it was cursed great well i'm hungry now i want to eat it be there in just a moment dear i just want to find vax can i find vax i'm going to go look-- i'll look in his room and then i'll look in the temple to the raven queen that we have hey oh well no hi that's gross is it hey one quick thing that i was thinking about and i know that you keep bringing it up and i keep dodging this right but-- so when i was researching the raven queen-- -- she hates undead so the fact that delilah briarwood is back again and the person that we're going after it seems perfect hey do you think your queen lady is going to chime in there and help us out maybe end this cycle of whatever the fuck it is she's doing in the shadowfell that's so cryptic right okay no i mean do you talk to her though because you know pike talks to sarenrae right so have you asked her if she's going to help us kill delilah briarwood okay all right well not necessarily don't talk like that i'm serious you have to keep a positive outlook otherwise you're doomed that's good life is good yeah all right no no no it's about what i expected yes good night and i go to the library what if she's done that if she did that to the sun tree how old is delilah briarwood it was a temple to ioun right yes because he's the god of secrets what if she is vecna she's just finishing what he started so they got run out of wildmount another ziggurat right and then she got run out of here so she went to ank'harel what other pyramids have we seen though have we seen any other-- the mindflayer place that was a ziggurat under kraghammer oh my god is there a ziggurat in kraghammer but it would've been underground i mean who knows where the fuck it was wait wait wait what about the temple where we saw the other sphinx was that another ziggurat there ah is there a ziggurat-- they can come out everywhere well he's a tree we didn't look in the ziggurat in ank'harel there could've been bodies there too you're not here praying to sarenrae obviously it would take a very long time to go to every ziggurat that we've seen and see if there's an army inside of it if they've been preparing things there over this past year that we haven't been doing anything we should go to the shadowfell and fucking end this before she sets out her armies everywhere we have seven we could go through there's only seven of us who knows it's the shadowfell we need to talk to eskil ryndarien and see what he knows about the shadowfell right he's been studying the shadowfell too i don't think so at this point we just have to-- hey at least vecna's not a god bonus there we can't waste time you'll talk to eskil because i hate that motherfucker crotchety old fuck i think that was the best one i've ever heard though ashley that was a really good one go find eskil somebody else is going to go find out from him right while that was going on is that caravan still in town that was coming through we've only been gone a day are there any fancy fucking chalices that i could fucking buy for a heroes' feast fabulous do you have a sippy cup lid though how much how much for the cup 1200 gold pieces well larry you know that these chalices are probably going to be used to save the world it does doesn't it and just think how wonderful it will be when you can tell everyone that you sell to that you sold the things that saved the world to vox machina it wasn't a one persuasion 19 lady vex'ahlia at your service i turn and show him the scales from the chroma conclave this is my favorite shop on the citadel i like your style can i insight and make sure this isn't some sort of enchanted piece of fucking-- what would i add to that okay see if he's full of shit 14 you know what fuck it we're probably going to die anyway and you just threw the sippy cup lid as a little-- yeah i want to buy some holy oil or get some holy oil from the church or something (laughter) where do i get holy oil we've gotten holy oil before i just can't remember from where 21 oh really larry do you have any holy oil all right that's it just one skeletons everywhere how much that's good for two applications i think oh this one has a little bit missing how much because this is less than it normally is 150 gold sure only because percy gave me a look you know what-- yeah okay pat pat where you're not going to come with us don't say it's been a pleasure i give him a big old hug and i give him i give him-- i don't have any feathers left i don't think i have no money tary tary i ripped it up about two weeks after you moved in i open up my pouch and i've got zero personal gold just party funds percy i think he'd want you to have that yeah give it to me thanks friend 30-soul rock got it i will show it to her help me what is that i think i might definitely how are you going to get doty home right lionel i think he likes to be called lionel see who you pick up along the way exactly i like it it's epic catchy we might not make it out alive if you talk to my brother that's what he says he says it every time same so we'll know of course we'll come visit you i love you so much the oil is helpful thank you right yeah i probably should do that huh okay i'll brush it a hundred brush strokes every night just like you bye goldie (fake-cries) yeah that needs to go to a blacksmith or something we can't plane shift unless we alter the necklace you have a bajillion health points why let's put something living inside of there and wait ten seconds and then take it out and see if it's still alive if it's ten seconds and it's not knowing to hold its breath it will come out alive still can anybody tell if this plate is cursed can you tell if something's cursed bro can you tell if something is cursed pike gross were you the one burping earlier too yeah but somebody burped in the first half of the game and it was foul i'm trying to figure out if this plate mail is cursed or not no but it's so we can put it on somebody here yeah 'cause what if something's waiting for us on the other side yeah but what if there is we've got to waste a fucking minute we've got to protect scanlan for a minute okay i'll put on my necklace fuck the robes are we going down sure can i get close to it and put the necklace near it without touching it that seems promising nobody is proficient in history oh god our notes on the shadowfell there are things that are moving below i see them as we hop down i cast pass without a trace on all of us do we see any other orbs around 25 yeah i also want to look and see what the fuck kind of creatures it is that are moving around in the city but i want to see what kind of creatures are flying around as well 23 ooh shit you rolled bad yo those buildings yeah like hide behind something (whispering) there's something in this building (louder) are there windows on the building at all peek in why would there be otters in the shadowfell does it look like any of those scary creatures are around each other or are they avoiding each other grog get your head back inside there's things flying around out there i want straggly but still a braid really nasty straggly hair i think we should probably try to observe the things that are flying around the tower observe still try to avoid any of those scary creatures but see if they avoid each other as we look at them no those things were speedy be normal let's just do it what is that what is foresight holy shit that's amazing still being stealthy but yeah matt's like i will kill you all the chained oblivion was the shadowfell always the shadowfell never seen anything like it they don't look like they're afraid of walking around i'm following them just subtly and we still have pass without a trace on 34 is there anything else around should we kill them get ready for an ambush when they walk past you guys we'll attack wait until we attack them first two different ones and it's an automatic natural 20 not that it matters because i already got a crit bramble shot oh shit dude 56 for me don't kill him can he still talk pull the bodies inside 35 i grab the thing that was making the smoke and bring it that's what i'm thinking we hide the bodies we'll bring the bodies inside too so that nobody sees them oh that's a good idea separate him from his god do it no he's not scared of pain do you know delilah briarwood vecna i don't know who lives in the tower vecna is that where he is i'm a really good friend of his oh but he's not back yet what ritual what is the ritual going to do what have they brought and that shit's happening soon we have a thing we can at least get through town he likes it stop giving him pleasure wow we're terrible people we should put him out of his misery should we grab any cloaks i have a holy symbol to vecna that we took off of somebody in the original ziggurat it is okay i just want to take a nap or a cozy sit-down this is amazing we could put food out in front of us i think it's necessary
