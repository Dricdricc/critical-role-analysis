we're going to be at metrocon next weekend (sings) in tampa florida ridiculous we should get out of here (gasps) we're not around lava now i was planning on staying up i'm not leaving trinket up there i notch my arrow she needs better dice teleport us out of here 21 we're all going to die i'm stuck at the top until we can run we're stuck because there's only one flying carpet i'm going to cast hunter's mark on the elder brain and shoot hail of thorns into the elder brain 19 do i roll regular damage plus the hail of thorns 39 on the first hit and then 18 for the second and anything within five feet takes damage as well they take the same amount unless they make-- oh wait yeah they take half damage on a saving throw i want to do my second attack yeah 15 i don't know what else to do i'm stuck up at the top just bull rush and tear down the well we need to get out or take down the elder brain get it keyleth (cheering) teleport us fly us get us out float it into the bag of holding don't be a dick that doesn't miss you can climb it he rolled a 20 he's going to try to eat her brain that's not to matt that's to the little brains no you could attack with your chain i am going to attack-- i'm going to put hunter's mark on-- oh my brother just died on the one attacking scanlan 14 but he's bent over and i've got a bird's-eye view of him yes so i just roll again 22 right 11 points of damage no i did not i won't though three extra that's for hunter's mark okay on my second one should i just try to attack him again kill him all right i'm going to kill him try to hit him again 18 16 plus-- 19 i knew he was going to do that i totally knew he was going to do that kima would help us but she's stone just do the other side oh no we never closed the other door no we didn't oh no k'varn i can't believe we killed clarota no because i didn't help you guys thanks tiberius yeah no go down and save them honestly because i'm staying up top for right now unless we can teleport out why vax no on pike you can't would he be able to make it now we've got to squish those little brains oh this is what happened to grog forever we should probably get out of here they're coming up the sides they're coming up the sides i thought you had a crush on her stomp all over the brain to get to it i should just stay where i am right guys i'm going to do that yes is there any other-- there's just a little brain in there right now oh fuck me jesus we're going to get out of here real fast you guys are listening to me right because things are coming up the side and we need to get out of here i don't give a fuck i'm going to hunter's mark a little brain or should i keep attacking the elder brain what do you guys think i know that's why i'm kind of like hm all right i can do hail of thorns on it again so i'll hunter's mark it and then i'll do hail of thorns on it 27 i don't add-- do i add hunter's mark to that damage or just my regular and then that okay 22 24 oh right because you're right next to it sorry keyleth 14 sorry oh right you're really really strong okay so i'll try to-- i guess i'll just attack it again because i've got nowhere else to go 17 oh really with it oozing out and everything fudge i'm going to climb onto trinket for some reason because that makes sense it's like a jello mold of brains yes big damage get out they won't see you trinket so i can fly if i'm on trinket right sweet you can do it buddy you can do it yes nobody's really low yeah can you cast something on kima oh no we should just keep her stone for now yeah cast it on yourself man no he can't-- ba dum tss that's a double standard out out out no how are we going to get out of here good thing you healed yourself pike yeah that's the second time this round i'm going to-- (sighs) is that brain fluid still floating around it like out and stuff i know but it might fall and tip i want to attack the elder brain i'm going to-- i think all i can do is a conjure barrage so it's the cone of attack so that will get hopefully all the things because i'm shooting down right it's 60 feet okay yeah can i do the edge on the brain and get-- all right let's do that okay yes they get saving throws okay but do i have to roll to see if it hits or it just hits oh okay cool 17 plus hunter's mark on the elder brain three additional do i get plus two for the bracers on that conjure barrage okay so that would've been 19 19 so then i want to attack the elder brain again 20 all right 11 oh wait wait no lies 13 yeah give it a try gross whoa i want to kill it before we leave now why a saving throw oh right no you've got to hop on the carpet when it comes up grab the gnomes i thought 18 was the number that we were aiming for-- shit oh i understand we need to go you can do that i can fly on trinket yeah everybody's covered man yeah not yet yeah i know i didn't get to-- i know i didn't use the movement on the last turn i just didn't say it because i'm an asshole ten on me oh okay 11 oh i rolled a nine plus two plus two for my ring that i'm wearing so whatever that was for me which is going to be a major fail because trinket is the dumbest (laughter) no that's a minus four so that would be a nine for trinket who is by the way my only way to get out of here right now trinket's a boy if he's about to die at least get his gender right (sings) we've made some enemies they're coming after us what is happening right now (gasps) greyskull run i hate that phrase they won't be able to open that back up okay oh okay okay should we wrap it at all say hello hi we are affiliated with the king we were on very secret business for the crown actually and that is why you weren't informed of our business okay (laughs) with advantage that would be a 20-- no 35 that's not possible 25 yes of course we will in the meantime we'll just go to our keep that we have in town you poor thing you should get out more love the hat of course holy shit we survived what was that what are we just carrying around this stone kima with us or are we taking her back to our-- but we're in town now so we're safe yeah so it'll be fine well we've got a fucking flying carpet yeah we're in town fuck it everything's possible we won't tell her how much time has passed do not put her in the bag of holding do not (laughter) this is so messed up can i hold it for a second hope you remember us that's it jarett was the one we appointed as the head guard right captain i don't remember about the little fellow oh we decided to get a statue for the garden put the gun down percy yeah they're so cute all right that's adorable he's in bed quick question friends so we kind of started a war am i right kraghammer is potentially in grave danger am i right we should probably let them know as soon as possible he's dead you don't think they'll come up and attack well you need to share it with us tiberius little darling damn it he's so cute i don't know what to do why don't we tell them we didn't find it why don't we just hide the horn she doesn't she wants to hide it maybe she wants to destroy it maybe she wanted to get it up above ground so she could destroy it she's a paladin she's good paladins are good by-- some of us truly trusted clarota tiberius we're sorry to wake you i just want to hear your lovely little explanation darling about what the horn is and why you don't trust kima please you haven't told any of us anything what if they want to destroy it question why wait but your crushing fist couldn't destroy it so maybe lava can't destroy it so maybe it needs something extra special that only they know about wind blows why don't you trust them not the horn why don't you trust kima i think they want to destroy it no i don't trust it anywhere out of our sight it's in the bag i think we should tell her we didn't get it and see what she does no we didn't destroy it we say oh no they we got overrun and we had to leave or we go oh well good then actually we do have it you can do that yeah or she might not be able to tell because we're so good at lying (laughter) i fall asleep on the table ugh trinket let's go to bed that's great that and pike's stank from her armor gross a little pile of grossness have a good night i know i know but they're sleeping and it's okay how are we going to get it out of there teleport it can you pull it out and make sure it's still there and okay wait no check though i want to make sure it's okay but i want to make sure you just left us no we're going to talk to her first you were drunk it's okay you were so drunk and then run away it's fine it's fine guess what we are alive so we killed k'varn right but not before we were overrun with a bunch of evil brothers of his hey right look at his hat what exactly was your mission kima well thing is it's not here pretty safe nothing can touch it can i insight 19 so the other horn is still safe oh you're in our home we hurt that elder brain real bad but not bad enough okay that's good and your order is
