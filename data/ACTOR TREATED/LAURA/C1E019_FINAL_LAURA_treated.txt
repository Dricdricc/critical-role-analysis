(grog voice) i would like to rage is there moldy dungeon smell that's lovely why would you say that travis and i will be in vancouver next weekend not this coming weekend but the weekend after but we're not going to be here next week so yeah should say that it's a con and you should come say hi in vancouver go look at my twitter you'll see what it is about i didn't realize the audience chose that 30 30 points roll for grog i rolled 18 for me oh that's good 19 for grog what those dice are magic 19 for grog 18 for vex these are pretty good initiatives (grog voice) grog-- (grog voice) no grog doesn't want to rage grog shouts out in giant wait my giant masters were killed by a white dragon which we think is here will you help us fight him okay i am going to use grog's dice it is proper wait okay that's not his that is mine okay well that is good he is really happy that i am playing him because i rolled a one for grog i think i should not-- okay wait that's his action does he get advantage however because he is speaking giant and he's in the cold (grog voice) can grog move at all (grog voice) where is he he is going to stay there a moment of silence for that horrible thing i just witnessed i am very hurt can i get up am i prone okay i am going to cast hunter's mark on the one that took a little damage already and then i am going to shoot him all these are for like really large groups of people i am going to shoot him three times can i shoot him three times i'm going to shoot him two times this was good times this was fun you guys 14 for that that probably doesn't hit 14 also doesn't hit the second time oh my god what is happening (laughter) i am going to run over to cover what is that other side yeah i am going to hide in that little thing and go trinket hide with me that's all of it you should avoid those boulders in the future but he said intruder when we came in spell save dc is a 17 can you add your inspiration add your inspiration he can hit you that's true your spell might have worked should i say in giant (in grog voice) what say you let's fight this bastard together seriously while everybody's having a conversation i would like to take a healing potion okay how much do i take for a superior it is so just regular healing potion for now which is what 2d8 yay that's good grog (in grog voice) they'll take us but it is at our own folly (strangled gibberish) which translates to take us as in lead us or carry us on your back wait can we rest a little before we go fight this thing so we can get spell slots back and heal can we yes yes are they going to fight with us grog will you ask them if they're going to fight with us (gibberish) (repeats previous gibberish) (grog voice) i think that's a no i wish i wouldn't have wasted a healing potion just then because we can take some-- you roll a d8 you can roll up to 11d8 plus two for each time what get some stuff before we fight a dragon yo (grog voice) grog would like to take his chain of returning off of one of the axes he had it on and put onto the firebrand warhammer that he took off of that dwarf in kraghammer the mean guy he took it off great oh that was a good roll come on also good roll it was a one travis is going to be so pissed when he gets here his flight landed i got a text his flight has landed he's on his way they serve the dragon what sorry about that yes grog lights his blazing axe i snuggle very close to trinket is there a way to like melt the spires (whispers) i interrupted you that's pretty badass oh no we're not in-- 14 oh are you like an assistant i was just wondering what happens if the contract that we magically signed doesn't ever come to fruition percy is very good at lawyering we are very capable fighters (grog voice) how thick is it (grog voice) can grog run at it and try to bash it really fast it's a hammer which i feel would be better against ice i feel like every dice is betraying me no i'm going to curse yours i'll just leave it at that it slipped out of my hands but i'm going to keep it 15 plus what eight plus nine okay here we go i don't know with my ones as of late oh that's just ten oh yes right 13 should we keep a little more quiet than that 19 21 for grog we should protect her she should be towards the back we should take a short rest so that we're going in you know could you see when you were looking into their mind if it is open or if it is just a big cavern because here's the thing if they fight with us it's great but if they turn on us then we are going to have to fight them at full power again i want to keep perception out to make sure that nothing is ahead of us okay but this is pertaining to dragons he is one of my favored enemies so i have additional bonuses to tracking him and insight against him favored enemies things he would have laid down for us stuff like that you know just to see okay 18 half of a giant right (laughs) thanks brother oh good maybe we should stay back good thinking lyra before we move forward i've studied dragons a lot i just want to say so obviously we all know they're susceptible to fire damage yes this is an ice-breathing bastard do as much fire attacks as we can if he could be distracted during combat maybe not happy but he'll still want to eat us but yes we could do that it might be something to think about before we spring an attack yes with advantage because it's pertaining to dragons is that an insight check okay let me see what that-- oh that's grog's what am i doing okay so 20 was the first roll 20 is the high roll oh wait no 22 it can't resist fire what about lightning damage do i know anything about that probably grog he's going to be the one that's going to be up close out of all of us that's true he takes half to piercing and slashing trinket's right there scanlan lyra he is really really cool here's the thing if he doesn't have stoneskin i probably won't let him charge probably see how tough he is and he gives good massages lyra tell him that i love him very much he's a boy look at his giant dick oh little buddy what does his armor class raise by nice i promise lyra i will let him attack this battle it's happening what why isn't my brother here i need to check for traps from now on snoop ahead (laughs) oops oh that's good is that feather fall nice okay i perceive some more and see if i see any traps ahead of us the whole time that would be a seven 15 good for you there's a thing here we should not step on it i have one job on this ship we should maybe break down this ice wall and then not walk on this area how about that before we go into the actual lair of the dragon-- once we get to it i don't know much more of these thingies there are do we want to go in as if we're offering it something and saying hey we love you we want to bring you people and stuff like that or do we want to send somebody in first and act like they're here to serve it and then we all spring in and surprise it what do you want to do it wants to eat anything frozen basically it freezes things and then it eats them i don't know if they had a method or if they just walked right in an offering what if we laid a trap in the offering what if we used your frag grenade that you did is it a bomb does it set off on a timer is it very fragile do we have any bombs or anything like that because i have a very big beautiful diamond of awesomeness that we uncovered before that i keep about we could present him with this big huge-ass diamond and then have it trapped with some sort of exploding device we could put it in a bag and then put the diamond on top of a bomb or something and then when he picks it up and like (explosion) in his face sorry but your chain of returning is attached to your blazing warhammer now can i from here before we go in there-- i'm going to cast hunter's mark on him no are we doing that yeah yeah we do i am putting percy's hand grenade inside this bag along with a diamond oh it's a really pretty diamond as long as it doesn't explode that's true diamonds are really strong i put that in the bag are we tossing this at him what are we doing here hold the bag yeah me scanlan scanlan should definitely talk to him over by percy but further oh come on giants help us out i want to make my way further up while he's talking i want to make my way along the wall a little oh no 20 natural 20 and all i needed was fried chicken (laughter) a little bit further there that sounds good if we unfreeze them they could help us and then you put it back in the bag and then you give it to him natural 20 all the way natural 20 i've had my bow notched and i cast hunter's mark while all this is going on i rolled a 20 me too 25 okay i'm going to cast lightning arrow and i'm going to attack through my blazing bow okay oh that's good that is a 25 okay so that is 4d8 of lightning damage saving throw for half yes 13 plus six is 19 20 so ten plus regular damage right for my regular 19 i know 11 plus ten is 21 plus hunter's mark is four and then plus my blazing bow which adds another ten where did that land shit balls i'm so aggressive right now i'm going to roll a different one oh my god that looks like a one oh wow two ones that's great that was one attack okay the lightning arrow is a bonus so i am going to send trinket where is he dear lord can trinket run around and attack his butt oh so trinket can't do shit right now trinket's going to move and i'm going to attack again can i do that we want to spread out can i attack again all right i'll hit him again okay just a regular attack through the bow yes 17 it was a 25 that hit before what was the first attack that hit can i stealth then i'm going to move along the wall further yeah like that ten is trinket frightened okay come on trinket no he's probably pretty frightened oh does that count as intimidation he rolled an eight so i'm guessing he's pretty scared you've still got a really big dick i'm just telling him to encourage him what was that for seriously my passive perception is 21 just for future reference yeah so roll and then add 11 oh that's good no that's damage you do it all and then add the two no that's all five plus two so 38 is 40 plus anything else wait plus two damage to all-- oh but that's already-- wait plus 40 so if we aim at that area that doesn't have scales can i see him at all and he's pretty far away if i just try to (bowstring noise) up and i'm at disadvantage does it seem like if i cast something that would do mass damage would the giant then not want to attack with us anymore i'm scared to hit the giant with it because i want to do conjure barrage but i'm afraid of the giant exactly so that would be bad potentially should i try it all right then i'm going to try to hit the dragon with a regular attack i'm not going to do conjure barrage it's 120 i don't that's not the feat that i took i took read lips i'm really good in populated areas okay cool here we go yeah no doesn't hit (laughter) that's better 27 okay what is that 12 13 14 plus a d6 because i'm badass plus six that's 19 that's not even close to 40 but it does something and i say fuck you we're as far away as we can be and i can't move any closer no both of those sucked the first one was 20 20 was the first matthew mercer now we try to shake it off (sings) i shake it off i do not succeed it's a three 20 why did you say the first one was for me why couldn't the second one be for me where is he he's going to run up for the time being and hide give me this he's not hiding he's going to run up to this area so that he's got a better vantage point to run up for the next turn he can't get any further into this little crevice can he run right here that's not really protecting him is it all right do i no i don't i looked it up today yo i don't get shit on attacks for him because we transferred over from pathfinder all i can do is talk to him well chat i looked it up and i don't think i have advantage i literally texted matt today and i was super upset seriously i thought i had it too and then i looked it up in fifth edition i don't get that i shouldn't have even said anything i should've just gone with you i'm an idiot 54 damage what no is it too big to carry he's got a flaming axe right now okay so this is the new thing d10 plus five plus eight plus another-- yeah yes plus 3d6 oh that's good 16 plus ooh 21 i watch her with my mouth agape five times and one more nice yeah but it's also going to hit scanlan he said it so happily too evil and also onto the grenade i'm sorry i'm sorry i don't know why i said that come on scanlan did the dragon take damage can i try to shake off the attack oh at the end but i was inspired by that explosion okay i'm going to attack it oh that's such a good roll that's okay it was a disadvantage that's 27 with a disadvantage with the exploding arrow so what do i do do i just roll regular oh shit 16 and then 3d6 3d8 2d8 that's okay i'm going to roll them both okay six additional did i say what my other damage was was i speaking out loud oh no i'm sorry i'm stupid an exploding arrow i also meant to say i was shooting from my blood-seeker bow i pulled it out and said i was going to do it i was going to shoot from my blood-seeker bow for that can i do that so for my second attack i want to throw trinket in and i want trinket to go up and attack him he's going to do two claw attacks so that's 2d4 each time okay he doesn't hit on the first one but the second one he gets a 21 yes okay was i wrong oh okay either way that's 13 extra damage for trinket are you unconscious oh no scanlan's unconscious oh my god but you can take a potion on your turn at least 47 no 47 and 1d6 53 i'm still very scared ten halved because he's got stoneskin who all took them oh the four of us because we're assholes you can place it-- hit the giant and the dragon is the other giant dead how much radius does the dragon take up me okay i'm going to move trinket away yeah and then hide behind that outcropping thing yeah i'm going to cast hail of thorns i did and i failed it yeah so i'm going to cast hail of thorns on the dragon 26 that's a good question hail of thorns okay wait next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon-- spell-- range it just hits it but then everything within five feet makes a dexterity saving throw sorry guys oh sorry grog 13 for the actual arrow plus another five for hunter's mark 3d10 because i'm casting it at 3rd level 18 for the hail of thorns oh and then i get another attack (giggles) this is crazy okay so i'm going to-- should i do conjure barrage conjure barrage at them as well oh you're right so a regular i can only do a regular attack okay so regular attack oh that doesn't hit that's a 16 i didn't 18 oh he's got another fucking platform no that was higher than 24 plus six fire damage six creepy zahra he doesn't want us to die come on lyra killing blow (screams) okay here's the thing did he roll far enough away that he is not within ten feet of the dragon so he's far enough away okay then i'm going to lightning arrow the dragon do i have to attack i do have to attack regular that's good that's a 29 okay so that is 4d8 against the dragon 14 17 that's good that's another six for hunter's mark plus another 11 for my second attack-- (cheering) jesus please oh it's 30 13 14 15 no four ugh he's still alive fuck is it his turn 28 i'm at 28 hit points are you unconscious too so it does it back to him 17 yes oh my god you can kill it just because it attacked you oh my god i stand up and i give zahra a giant hug you were amazing gather up all of the shit we have to take and put it in the bag of stuff wait we have to harvest it special is it nature what is it a check for i have a low nature what do you have can i help at all can i assist can i hold her utensils for her everything we need all of it don't we we'll all stand and watch pop them out pop those bitches out but you get an advantage yeah that's 15 plus six is 21 into the cooler bag i jiggle them around in the bag just because yeah i'm holding it plus another roll for advantage ooh that's way better plus six 23 how do we fit it in this bag is it magic we could roll it up in one of our fancy robes though and hold on to it and pack it in-- oh we yeah let's chisel out some of the ice what about all this gold in the cavern but we need white dragon or wait are you sure it wasn't the blue dragon that we harvested okay we have 37 dragon teeth from the first white dragon another one let's go for claws just her all of us 20 for scales
