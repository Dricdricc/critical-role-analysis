oh hey oh hi guys hi i'm laura bailey rpgs huh so the first time i ever played pencil and paper rpg was with this group because of that guy i always played rpgs like i'm a big video game fan i'm a geek for that and yeah and so i always chose rpgs as what i wanted to play so surprisingly it wasn't anything new for me once we started playing i fell into it really really fast because i was accustomed to all of that insta it was so much fun it was only supposed to be a one-off game when we started this and we all had so much fun playing together that it was like we can't stop this when's the next time we can get together and do it again and again and again yeah it was epic that is true actually yeah yeah sportsball hi also ale it's amazing the amount of times that we've had conversations because when you're playing a game we all see it as real we've lived those experiences for so long that that world exists and our characters exist and those experiences exist but only between us and then as soon as we were able to bring it to geek and sundry and now you guys are taking part in it too all of a sudden it's a real thing if that makes any sense to know that you guys know who percy is is phenomenal and that anybody loves trinket as much as i do that means so much we're all going to be insane in the next five years i know it mr mercer's been waiting for you wait-- be a critter go to disneyland that's the moral of the story what is happening well yeah you have to sneak through though they won't be able to-- and he wouldn't give it to you it was worth it i like i said like to play rpgs a lot and vex was always a name that i would go to for my characters i would create in those games then i always think that elves need to have apostrophes in their names because in every rpg like dragon age every game that i play i recreate characters like ten times before i stick with one so there's a list to level four of characters-- yeah vex is always in that list there's other names as well that i might get to someday in this game hopefully not yes of course i'm not vex in skyrim because i feel like vex is sacred now i don't want to use vex on-- is that weird then when me and liam-- okay so here's the thing i'm getting off-subject when i got invited to the game liam had already taken rogue and i wanted to be a rogue he had already taken half-elf and i wanted to be a half-elf and i was like what the heck man you're so stealthy then i remembered that we actually are twins and i was like maybe we should be twins in the game as well perfect that's really good what's funny is for the first year you kept looking at me like what's my name how do i spell my name is there an h in it i don't know that's an easy way to remember so your name actually means fart and you just don't know it i feel like matt would know our most-- it was pretty epic we thought we were going to lose two party members at the same time we were like no ugh well i got the kill on the creature that killed pike i don't get a final kill on a lot of things and it was like ugh and so pike is dead on the ground and i got the last shot so i'm moving forward shooting arrows it was sad tears falling down screaming pike that's right because we were falling-- this carpet's never going to work it's too heavy (horn sounds) that's happened to us a few times before we started streaming he would skip our turns it's terrifying that hourglass you put down when the lava was coming down and we had to get out of the cavern it was horrifying when you were unconscious in the lava what i thought he was done if trinket dies i-- yes that is true i went back and watched the stream of that to see if you could see our hands shaking as much as they were because all of us were terrified during that fight and then the second one was even harder than that what the heck matt yeah you guys are awesome
