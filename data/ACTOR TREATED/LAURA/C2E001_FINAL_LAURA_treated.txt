like-- like-- oh gosh okay i'm going to use thaumaturgy and i'm going to make all the windows in the place open up really fast like crash open you're right i'm sorry i use thaumaturgy and i close all the windows (laughter) ta-da come see me tonight at the carnival i'm really good but he's a magic cat how can you be allergic to magic cats --for cat dander yeah i mean he's learning he's getting really good at it yeah you should have seen him he disguised himself the other day and it was like (clicks tongue) well he's going to learn i'm not going to go to the academy yeah that one how long have you had yours wow that's cool a frickin' cat can i see one of your books we know it's rich people that go there we have to find a way to get you in well we had more what's the name of it again have you played it i'll teach you someday it's so much fun yes i mean i can teach you if you want okay i'll deal yes sure this will be fun okay you draw three cards well i give you three cards so you use 3d6 yeah okay so hide your roll from me because we can't know so first you have to ante up how much coin do you want to put in oh great how much do you want to front him a silver okay this is great okay am i doing this right now i'm going to give us three cards so we both roll but we can't see that's good okay bluffing how do you know i wasn't no wait there's rules no he totally did it she totally did it this is really hard sam but you know that's my skill too so i'm going to try to do it as well 'cause that's my skill as well i did not notice him doing it okay so i'm going to try to reroll one of my three too oh right oh shit 13 okay so the best hand you can get is three of a kind then after that it's a straight a high straight then a low straight then it's if you get all evens or if you get all odds then it's two of a kind then it's nothing it's just high card okay but now we put in a second amount because you can up the ante and you get one more card no but wait wait wait you can put in more money and then i deal you a different card you get to give a card back and then i deal you another card one more silver okay i'll keep it low too because you're only doing the one so i only put in one silver too yes and now give one of your dice back whichever one you don't want and roll it again i don't want to reroll any okay now you show what you got and we'll see who wins i got three fives no it's okay just don't do it again but i'm sorry i took all this money from your friend why though but i won it tell you what i'll give you-- none of it back i can't okay here's one silver back-- okay but i insist all the money back all right fine it's mine thank you yay see isn't that the most fun right oh wait is that bad well i only learned last night you guys people took my money when i was learning oh jeez now i'm definitely giving you your two silver back don't worry about it man (laughter) have my baked goods come out yet i just want to go to the carnival should we do it we've done that it sucked so much well by mistake well i lost it but he made so much do you guys want company do you want us to come and hang out with you today i can hear you bottom line-- and i touch nott's shoulder and i cast blessing of the trickster that would be the worst character choice ever (laughter) you have advantage on all your stealth checks because she is all kinds of trouble what's her name the creepy doll no don't say that i don't want to see art with you with annabelle's face what's a trost we just can't go by the baumbauch ale is that the one you need oh well why do you need it you need a beer i've got to say i miss those two people we ran into at the carnival i don't have very much either aw it's like ren faire that's vax that's vax's dice no i gave it back to you remember is this a big shop while he was talking to the shopkeeper i'm going to take out as many books as i can and move them around on the shelves and then take some of them and turn them around to where their binding is facing the inside natural 20 i skip out the door and i cast blessing of the trickster on you again just in case we came am i the only one going do we really have to give up our weapons i don't feel okay with this magic [break] here's the thing some of us have weapons that we don't want to pass away to other people so how much of a chance is it that we could get through without having to do that you know right and we really want to see the show but you know we are really good at security like all of us are really strong and we could fight things that came up too so maybe it would be best if you don't take our weapons and then we could help so do you want to hire us we could ask you for days off sometimes like is his mustache especially bo-y like what that's really gross ew i don't want to perceive this i'm glad i didn't roll very well are you in the show too just one dagger pinky-swear me yasha yeah now we're best friends here's my sickle she has a really bad limp how are you carrying all of these weapons i think it's just stealth checks with the blessing sorry i wish i wouldn't have said it and then you could have had advantage just then but i'm not a cheater are you keeping track of what goes with what person because it's a lot stop saying the word 'goblin' people are going to hear you you're going to hang out with us the whole night of course you know they're a lot to handle yes what are you telling me oh yes if i skip around will i be part of the show and then i don't have to pay front and center as soon as i sit down i'm going to pull out my sketchbook and draw the moon and the shadow card that molly showed me oh there's no chairs aw i was picturing benches that's okay (whispers) it's like the serpent we fought you guys this is really different than most carnivals that i've gone to have we ever seen anything like this before well he just described what it looked like i invoke duplicity oh yeah we were right in the fucking front row look at us we're so cute yay 21 oh wait 22 okay well i'm just going to go for it all right i'm going to cast guiding bolt on the monster that just appeared let's find out you make a ranged spell attack okay okay well it's cocked it was 20 and then it rolled that's 11 plus-- what do i add to my-- guiding bolt plus five so 16 yay 4d6 ten 16 18 and then any attacks in the future-- the next attack has advantage yeah it was 4d6 radiant damage so yeah it was 18 and then i'm going to run the opposite direction away from him but i'm going to keep my duplicate up there that backpack's almost as big as my dice bag so she's going to stay here i can't reach that far but oh shit sorry sorry i didn't realize it was-- okay sounds good and you get advantage isn't chromatic orb like a really strong spell can i shoot an arrow at nott god somebody's going to get trampled i mean it's a fire hazard for sure oh shit okay we have to keep them from being dead oh god taking a stab oh now i'm worried i'm worried about the undead i don't know well i don't think i would know this so it's okay i'm going to say to the air and say dude are you here because this is like the coolest shit we've ever seen and then i'm going to cast toll the dead on the first zombie creature guy and there's a bell that tolls he has to make a wisdom saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage oh three that's lame and i made that sound like it was coming from my duplicate and my duplicate's going to run back a little bit and stand next to the pole yeah okay but roll again you have advantage hi caleb i like how every time you roll it comes out beau you got this that's a really pretty dice there was a sick guy there was an old sick guy and he turned into a zombie and i run over and i cast cure wounds on beau are you sick too did you get hurt hold on two seconds i'm going to cure her and then i'll cure you too seven points that's all i could cure oh that's better for you ten for you can i search the corpse of the woman which one when i'm going which one i make my second form just dart forward and start searching the body look at all the stuff that that one's finding over there (laughter) not bad 19 did i find anything shut up 14 your little dwarf girl was singing and she turns people into zombies (gasps) he does look suspicious i cast thaumaturgy and make it sound like there's a sound coming from behind him too natural one (coughing) there was some popcorn that i ate earlier (coughing) i have bloody fingers that was cocked unfortunately that was a good one oh well 16 yasha will totally kill me don't worry you can leave (weak laughter) well we saw an old guy turn into a zombie but it's possible that he just died because he was old and then he had the zombie curse on him and just turned you know because that happens a lot shirley she's really shy though and i hear she only talks to tieflings so you should probably send-- --my brother along because he's really good with that stuff next time we don't help that's what it comes down to we have to get molly out i used some new dice some new dice
