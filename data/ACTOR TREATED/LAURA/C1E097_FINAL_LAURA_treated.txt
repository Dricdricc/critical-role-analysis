it and see through the arrow okay what do i do okay yeah we'll back up as far as we can so i can still hit the thing it is a magical arrow and this thing cuts out all the magic but maybe once it goes through the siphon maybe i'll still be able to use it yeah we'll stand outside of the door i have two per short rest with disadvantage i am sharpshooter so disadvantage 30 it is the critical role dice can i have a pencil i got to write this shit down pencil i got to write it down or else i'll forget oh my god percy i saw something i did i think it was another plane otherwise i could just tell you what i sort of saw but i heard a lot of backblaze in the background don't we know something about obsidian-- no this is way bigger okay i'm glad i remembered that correctly because i was remembering it as a citadel and it's just a tower does it sound like anything you know i guess so yeah but wait actually percy off-subject but when i saw keyleth i mean she was destroyed right i mean fucking destroyed arms everywhere limbs broken just terrible we put her back together like we always do but i can't get scanlan out of my mind it's so random i know but what if that happened to him and we're not with him no one's there to cast revivify have you scryed on him again all right i don't know why he's on my mind obviously we have much bigger things not good at quiet i think we are who knows what this will lead to yes i don't know if i'm going to be able to sleep tonight yes from the exalted weapon that i got from saundor yes and it has the ability to shoot arrows that see right so i shot it into the orb and i saw through it fucking everything a sky and an orb and a tower an obsidian tower like twelve stories tall hey kiki good morning destroyed landscape whole other plane very dark

to korshad and see what we can do maybe he needs something and we can provide it just next time you get abducted by a bounty hunter give us some warning would you that would be a good idea i thought
