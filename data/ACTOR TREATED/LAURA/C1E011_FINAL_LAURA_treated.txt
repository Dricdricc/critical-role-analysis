presents grog oh wow another one a new carpet say vex is awesome say you love trinket that's ears and scanlan is still invisible right okay maybe scanlan can just stay perfectly still and you and i can just hide so that scanlan can-- i think we should duck and hide under his covers his big nasty fur bed i go should i grab scanlan and pull him in ugh oh god oh it's the underdark ugh i'm switching dice okay that's much better that was horrifying that's a 22 this is stupid oh no matt and against his nasty-ass scent oh no why okay 18 shh shh shut up make some noise oh god i know i just wish-- maybe call him back here and we can tie him up is that dumb make him sit down oh okay wow can he talk oh so he's really small should we capture him or should we just-- i don't think you know how big he is-- thanks vomit-y brother can i bust out my rope of infinite twine and start tying it around him just a lot a lot just a whole bunch as much as possible because it's infinite this twine oh shit great oh should we just run scanlan is outside ah against my ac oh no that hits me that doesn't count we need you scanlan you got me killed oh no it's starting we're already in the giant battle oh wow do i have a reaction can i jump away as a reaction can i hit my earring up and go giant giant being attacked help and i'm going to take out one of my-- hunter's mark and one of my sleep arrows and i want to shoot it with my sleep arrow i have a sleep arrow i bought them but i want tiberius to make me more i've asked for more sleep arrows if you can make them oh shit and that i know but after the rope i'm going to try to sleep sleep arrow first yeah oh okay i'm going to do the first arrow and then i'll try to put him to sleep okay smart thank you i know right 25 for the first hit oh then eight and-- 16 for the first hit and then sleep arrow laura and eight eight plus seven is 15 16 17 plus hunter's mark oh no oh sweet eight 16 do i add the two for the bracers on that okay 16 20 what is that 23 24 25 plus hunter's mark five for hunter's mark oh really that's 12 okay 16 28 and then i get another-- wait one more matt and 47 oh come on come on man that would have been-- that's impossible oh that does make sense he can't tell us that did i still do 47 damage on that sleep arrow or that was just-- okay okay all right i want to run as far away as possible from him you're not groggy at all you little-- and he doesn't hit me sweet oh god all right come on meteorite no don't come in close seriously honestly he can still get you from where you're at unless you move further away 31 nice (sultry) jump up his body because you hit him in the eye ugh he's huge hi i'm going to do hail of thorns on him yeah 26 okay so that would be-- i'm doing it at a level three so that is 3d10 15 16 that 16 yeah 16 damage for that plus my hunter's mark 17 and then my second attack all right 17 15 16 17 oh plus hunter's mark five for hunter's mark oh yeah woo for what all right ooh i like it oh we haven't rolled say something grog yeah oh that's me i'm an eight that's trinket too look at how big he is compared to us okay yeah because he's really stinky whoa whoa oh it worked i think it worked so disgusting that's not pitiful i think we're trying oh no that's an edge with a 15-foot drop 15 you're going to constrict him that's big that's me i am going to-- has he taken a lot of damage yet or are we just keep grappling him all right i'm going to attack him twice the second time with a-- i'm going to scootch up there so i can and i'm going to take two shots at him all right 24 26 second attack is a sleep arrow yeah 17 yes 15 16 17 20 and then the second one-- that's ten 11 12 16 on the second hit oh right i only get 5d8 oh okay look at all these dice i have 14 20 22 yes travis and yeah i have three now i have one shh no don't wake him up don't rock him oh clarota can you dominate him okay yeah (sounds of protest) but you can't control its body yeah can we quickly tie him down while we're talking oh yeah let's frickin' tie him down at least can we tie him up right now it's a big ol' feast i know i know it's a lot of food for you clarota what about the thing he was carrying can you eat that thing's brain chain it up can we just use chain and tie him up we have chain grog has chain we chain him up percy and i chain him up we use the chains that we have we have chained him i know we do have some more never-ending rope and we can keep using that a lot of it no no no yeah let's do it keyleth-- oh never mind can anybody make it look like there's a big feast in front of him let's do it (whispers) what are you doing i do i speak back to him and say k'varn for him or against him oh got it oh it's (gibberish) be all like 'kh' yes yes very good (retching noise) hmm oh should we take the chains off make him agree first okay cool i start taking the chains off very carefully taking the chains off oh okay he wants to know where tiberius do you speak underdark but tell him to stay for now pike do you want to tell him what she said okay go ahead and translate that will this keep up while you're sleeping just curious oh we're set can we heal him if we heal him will it cancel it what i grunt at him and ask what his name is vex-'ah-lia oh come on i think we should name him-- we should name him tiny what is it i feel like we should hop down into the pit no no no not that pit in the big pit and rest and that way we're blocked from view tiny right oh well can we ask him can we ask him i mean if k'varn is annoying to him or if he likes him yeah yeah yeah that's true no no no we'll come up with an idea but i mean it's something keyleth is it safe to sleep next to him or is he going to attack us when we sleep yeah maybe we can chain him up to something while we sleep oh fine who's taking the first watch all right i gotta heal up are we why not okay tell us why okay yes please tell us the temple that you won't set foot in you want somebody else to go into all right do i know that do aberrations need to breathe all right okay i've also got an idea i mean what about that whole plan to break apart the apparatus that was holding the elder brain together i think we need to go over the top once the distraction is in the city blah blah blah go over the top acid that metal break it apart i think it'd be hard to get the giant up to the top of the temple but this is a brainstorming session everything's positive acid whatever break it apart release the illithids from his control and then we'll have them on our side at least not our side but against him all of the illithid in the city are his prisoners he's controlling everyone oh okay that's good i like your plan so far yes ooh i like that you know what though the beholder will just take control of the giant i think we should keep the giant as a distraction yes grog and then also another idea what if you used your pillars right against the beholder and trapped him in can you do that all right all right what if you're outside the temple and you cast pillars and then we go in and you stand outside tiberius what if you're on top that gives us something to hide behind right at least with his eyeballs yes a mile what are we going to do we're just going to go in without a plan what are we going to do oh we can do it in the morning the big one is releasing the elder brain we need to do that before we teleport right so we know what's going on i feel like we should get up close release the giant fly up over do our shit and then take him acid we have acid and we've got a bunch of acid in grog's bag do we have any metal no oh percy why no no no don't on jewels that's okay sapphire's okay then is it clean does it have any acid still on it i know i think a big weight once it's been acid-ed well it's on the top of the temple that's what i mean if you can jump on it then we'll be going down with it what if cursed giant lands on the metal beam after we've already weakened it yeah that is good no no no not if he's alone up there what if we do it do it do it-- can we remember i have advantage to recall information we didn't want it to happen we just were making sure it wouldn't okay what if you cast featherfall on it as right when we did it and then we can move it out of the way clarota what about-- why clarota the giant tiny k'varn oh he's warming up to it i think he's liking it i thought the elder brain was directly below it so it would have to step on the elder brain in order to-- okay me or chain or just swing it right yes we can swing it flying carpet because all his stealth checks lately have been perfect let's do it let's nap i love him or vex whoever oh he's going to drink the whole cask down oh he's so happy oh look he's farting oh tiberius some farts look at those farts oh my god what are you doing good job tiberius wait do you want to do his foot first (groans) oh come on (laughter) it looks disgusting ugh get it out of my face do it level one sorry brother it's almost healed we got a big battle brother shouldn't have fallen asleep in that-- sorry your nubbin lives no no no on the carpet that's adorable be careful plan what's that well it's a city we need the elder brain you wanna go against illithid they'll take you over and then we'll fight you i like it taliesin and we'll be going in over the top trying to get rid of the thing controlling the elder brain yes actually i agree with that if he's being controlled by you can he not be controlled by another being i like it they don't like clarota they aren't going to listen to clarota especially if they're controlled by another being we're going to tie a chain to it i feel like that uses way more time because what's going to happen is once it happens it's all going to go to shit so once we drop it we should probably just fucking go maybe keyleth you could turn into a bat and tell them all to go a different direction if it comes up we'll deal with it how about that none of this is a surprise none of it's a surprise he knows we're here okay okay what if we use a giant net and two of us get up on the carpet and we use a big net and catch as many bats as we can do we have a net oh good call great do you know where those entrances are your name's clarota i'm sorry we can just drop things in from above on the temple and stay out of the temple maybe just give up on the smoking out is that the one where you call your deity so we would know if she's going to help us or would she help us that moment right percy-- well are you going up top that could be keyleth yeah you guys could you guys be in charge of closing up the entrances sure here you are take it give it to me after it's done damn it good try good try percy okay yes good-- good thinking stay up top as long as possible we're not going into-- what if we can just attack from the roof from the opening in the roof is that possible can we attack from the roof from the opening in the ceiling can we attack him from up there we don't have to go in maybe we drop the thing attack from above as long as possible and hope the illithid attack him nobody go in the temple everybody attack from outside oh i was thinking it was just like a giant pyramid with one roof (laughter) that makes so much sense though that it's not (laughter) yeah oh god so this is the beam and we're going to attack this one and this one yeah oh is it like that oh god i'm picturing it so fucking different okay yeah yeah yeah like that okay the elder brain so we're going for one side of it and it hopefully goes-- okay i feel like you'll be fighting a lot more things i think it's better to just go from the top and drop in if we have to then we run we run away how will we follow you if you're on a carpet and we're standing on a thing and-- yeah okay oh god okay so are we doing it yeah clarota oh good question when you guys were flying overhead the top of the temple is wide enough for us to stand on yeah can we stand on the wall of the temple okay okay okay attack the beholder when it's dropped there eat food big eyeball oh my gosh tiny you're tiny he still smells really really bad oh i'll just keep him with me yeah are we going to polymorph grog and trinket can anybody shrink trinket too scanlan scanlan yeah who can shrink my bear can you cast fly on trinket and ride him i'll ride him if somebody casts fly on him no that's not a compliment scanlan you promise you'll take care of trinket if i go-- can trinket go in a smaller group he'll fit on the carpet if there's a smaller group but that's casting it twice no he can't ride the carpet we just said that trinket yeah trinket wants to be by my side you guys we don't need to if we burn a spell because trinket's the one that can't fit on the carpet in the first place everybody else can fit on right well but grog won't fit on the flying carpet this is a really-- this is like a mind puzzle 20 minutes so we can both fly i cast pass without a trace on the entire party before we all take off and you add ten 18 okay so you dropped us off oh no plus ten yes are we waiting that's so cute oh um yeah that's-- no plus ten would be 11 because he rolled a one forget about it inspiration inspiration i heard her say i cast-- i have the mouse while we're standing there i pull out an arrow and i'm tying the little tiny mouse onto an arrow pass without a trace can anybody cast dispel magic i have that he's right there though flying next to us he's secure it could also hurt grog if he's touching it if it's that hot okay what if we just give old mousey here-- turn him into a giant again and drop him right on it i've got him notched on the arrow okay we bring him up tiberius me and you but we're going to drop him as a full three-ton weight we'll aim him towards the part that will break and the three tons so we want him to be a giant when he falls exactly fly it up they might be controlled-by-k'varn stitch monsters (laughs) we are so high up can i see him can i go ahead and cast hunter's mark on him right now un-polymorph him well we splattered a giant you guys pick who up but we can hide over the edge so he can't see us right 16 what about the giant can you hide behind the giant splatter hunter's mark okay good so his eye would cancel out my hail of thorns attack is that considered like one-- okay oh that's true okay then i'm going to cast hail of thorns on him oh okay that's 29 okay yes i am okay the secondary attack i wanted to shoot through my bloodseeking bow though that's probably not going to hit that's a 13 23 okay so i'm casting-- it's a 3rd-level spell on hail of thorns ah where's my d10s okay i'm so nervous i don't-- i can't find anything okay there's a d10 there's a d10 okay so ten on that plus hunter's mark six so 16 that's the first attack and the second one-- 14 oh i know 14 oh wait i get plus two on that other attack whatever it was it was-- 16 plus hunter's mark i'm sorry my brain huh yeah 19 and then the bloodseeking bow bleeds him for ten damage each round might not be right potentially oh and i duck back as much as i can so i'm out of his sightline can i back up on the wall i crouch down oh good he can fly where's like the thing that fell is it blocking any sort of-- it's aiming at you that's a d10 come on clarota oh keyleth we're not leaving it's a cantrip away from clarota maybe up against the wall or something second one was a 20 get those monsters 40 no 39 39 was the second one oh the two together added up to 39 (laughs) pendulum nice (gasps) they won't pop back in your belt yeah that was your stealth right well i'm gonna just do the hail of thorns again from above yes as the first attack oh right it's a 19 yes okay so that's 3d10 ugh what 28 yeah they do 28 plus i get my two from my bracers right so that's 30 plus my hunter's mark-- 32 for the first hit and the second-- i wanna do it with the fire string okay oh disadvantage that's-- oh that doesn't hit damn it it was a 16 yeah so the second attack doesn't hit okay i want to kind of duck down do i still get to move trinket at all he's still got fly on him he's just hanging out next to me on top of a roof i just pet trinket and tell him to duck down (laughs) oh we're both ducking now dexterity tiberius can you rally the illithid stop being a dick you can break the grapple though right you've gotta go from the side you're not in a good spot they could suck your brain out that's me okay i'm going-- grog is dangling from him but i'm still going to try to shoot him i'm going to try to shoot him with the ensnare arrow that i have from percy try to maybe see if i can tie some of those stalks down to his head with it yeah yeah like a little hairnet the disadvantage was a-- what was that 20 yes okay so what do i-- how do i do that with the ensnare arrow 15 16 17 19 oh okay i didn't know that oh i thought it was like a sort of wrap-around-y arrow it wasn't like a-- i thought it was like a-- yeah that's what he told me it was a long time ago hopefully taking some of the stalks pinning it to his body right i know i was just hoping i could pin a stalk or two all right the second one with the burning bow wasn't that the same thing as the first one oh no 15 24 okay so ten 11 12 16 plus ten for the burning 19 and i duck down again and try to drop out of his view 21 what are you at ugh again he's getting it again ashley and (laughs) i know he hates you grog isn't he just a giant head okay no remember it didn't work wisdom i think oh well it's okay the high-- the first one was-- it would still be-- yeah we have a superior and what does a superior do it's like 100 hit points i think blind it no i don't know you can move yeah he's almost dead he's almost dead yeah just throw a fireball from the outside just throw one but you're not in the cone he's looking down you're going to get the fucking killing blow man just yeah just let-- the carpet there i thought vax was up before me okay i'm going to shoot an arrow at him hail of thorns as a level three that is doesn't hit that's a 14 okay cool i can't do that again can i all right then i'm just gonna shoot him through the flaming bow i'm not going to use it i'm just going to shoot him this is fun guys 23 okay 13 and 15 20 points of damage i wanna-- oh god how do i want to do this i do i'm crying i want to shoot him-- is it possible to shoot him right where the horn meets his head and knock it off of him all right then i shoot him straight in the eyeball vox machina and i hug trinket so tight ugh he's zombie beholder now oh my god is this like another boss kima's turning to stone no with advantage yep she is 45 yeah yes we do (sings) it's late it's late oh good to know oh kima so you could still attack him my magic attacks have been using-- working from above tiberius shoot him get 'im what what just happened ew what is that i know you're so ornery we fucking brought you back in here we told you to hit it crazy we got a bunch of illithid coming in here soon fuck oh my god we didn't die he knows everything he was evil oh pike thanks i know it was my first-- yeah so sleepy we still got a lot to do wait i have a question-- is the game going to continue next week or are you guys taking a week-- cool that's amazing
