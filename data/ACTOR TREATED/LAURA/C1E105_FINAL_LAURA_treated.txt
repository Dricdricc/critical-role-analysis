there's stuff in the store oh my god are you so nervous matt we'll find out he used crayon it's all written in marker no we're still in elysium are there any more gods here not that we know of yeah i don't think ioun is here maybe we can ask them so the gods can't get in and out we have to get near the the cliffkeep range near the pools of wittebak is where we need to go what is terrah teacher i was excited the last game and somehow have misplaced my pelor champion piece of paper i don't know how it happened it's not with my stuffs you'll tell me okay oh shit okay i'm sorry i had it and it's not here i'm in a lot of trouble you guys are we by those fruit trees again i'm so confused about the order of things if we go to ioun and we don't have everything we need for this prime trammel are we fucked i know we need godly power in order to imbue them right or something well pelor gave me this snap snap snap zip this it's a stone and it's supposed to be strong enough to-- part of it not all of it but it did seem like this is not enough is it this size or this size vax can you sense vecna is he still in the same place oh hard to tell then we should maybe talk to the people of terrah it's not that late keyleth perhaps you should let your people know that the world is in danger things are happening very quickly we just happened here first giants at the pools i thought it was something about gnomes there is that something you can do scanlan maybe the person we're looking for is a giant hill giants seems like they ate a lot of them pasty i have a question do you know anything about ioun but not much i know okay just checking this food is really good i thought we were walking into a fucking lake with gnomes living there i didn't realize we were going to fight giants it's possible the key is now inside of a giant's stomach in which case it still would be inside of someone just a different someone oh i remember it now it was a home inside oh i drew a little map of it yep that's it yes it's adjacent to the pools but there's a home in a forest did you like it that's what my map was i mean and look out for a home in the forest we'll have to fly pretty low i'm assuming the home is going to be covered by treetop it's very far we could misty step to the forest and then walk in the forest no reason darling don't be dark and creepy and make it sound like you're being nice i know you're being dark and creepy right now before everyone else gets up can i go find where vax is sleeping this is a tent what do i do do i knock do i shake it i'm not sure scratch oi vax are you naked put some clothes on then jesus keyleth sorry you don't sleep naked okay are you decent i'm coming in ugh come on so fucking weird (groans) i turn my back to him can i ask you a question well i'm going to i look down at my feet why didn't you ever try to take these back oh jesus you know the only reason i do things is that i take great joy in irritating you if you don't show irritation it makes it not worth it (sighs) can i turn around now i'm turning around good why are you so calm you're so calm and confident now it's weird is he still cold what's his heartbeat like (groans) jeez is there blood (gasping) no fucking way that's really cool wow so she gave you the option and then you came back and now you're what super super half-elf and we defeat vecna and you're done you're gone that's it instant is it like we kill him and you're gone that second or is it like we kill him and you're here for another week or until the raven queen realizes that you're still here she didn't tell you exorbitant that's a good word i know we're blessed idiots yeah after you die do you stand by her side do you like her now that's good she brought you back to us for a while i like her too anyway do you want the fucking boots back fuck yeah sure yes fine that's fine i wanted to give them back so there you go i'm glad you asked for them back i know just make sure you write it down somewhere that after you go back to the raven queen that your sister is your favorite in the universe i don't want every stitch none of it's worth you leaving what what the feywild you are a motherfucker you couldn't have just put them in the bag of holding great wonderful i like being barefoot that's great probably all right well at least there's that oh my gosh i put it in the safe place and i didn't realize it did they really know where i put it wow thank you thank you guys (mispronouncing) wind you could have gotten the last one though should we eat a feast first or should we save that okay i don't know what we're going to find yeah towards the mountains we got to look at our map we have a map after listening to everybody i'll lead the way that way i can keep an eye out for the forest next too and the house and all the things we're looking for i got a good look at the map that pelor held up in front of us as well survival great any advantage on that that's also my favored oh so much better 28 wet 'n' wild yeah past the pools oh man i should try to track any footprints in there and see if there's something around the edges maybe that lead back to-- shit i don't fucking know it's only a couple of miles it's the forest do i get advantage on that one perception what is that 21 21 can we fly down lower to where we're in between the trees i'll go all of us not so much tracking right now just a loose passover as we're going looking for any kind of hunting traps or trails signs of life of things that have been traversed a lot 27 okay we land i land and behind a tree i'm going to take form yay i don't want whoever it is to think that we threaten them in any way but then if they threaten us i wouldn't want them to attack us either i feel like maybe knock properly yeah but do keep an eye out for traps or anything weird on the way up yeah i'll go with you i'm walking with a smile looking very friendly i'll walk behind scanlan it's possible the person is the key we're not sure no he's out he's a very friendly bear look at him trinket smile be friendly what is it i was being friendly and it almost crushed me trinket be careful this thing was made for you no no be careful spit on it can he spit can trinket spit can i grab a stick and lift the edge of the mat up it's still there maybe when we leave we can crash it down i want to use a stick and oh here scanlan you were going to knock so that you don't have to touch the door in case it's magic i'm glad he didn't murder us with his bear traps i think so (sing-songy) we could give you some interesting conversation 35 years is a very long time what is an old gnome song pike do you think maybe a greater restoration is in order no reason that's like me that's exactly like me (whispering) give him some ale you don't know bet it's been a while since he's had some of that to find a very ancient goddess-- sprigg it is quite powerful yes but also maybe slightly dangerous you're not alone at the moment this is very true and i'd rather not put my life in the hands of you not knowing you very well yes so something bad could happen and you'd run away and we'd be stuck here because of ioun some of us are champions some of them don't like them some of them worship them but don't really get respect what's yours so you're a champion are you a champion of ioun no no i think we should save it he took the stone are you taking the stone trinket starts chasing the imp around the room unless they're boots and then they're amazing i am for them usually have you any idea where the key to ioun is yes boots that hold a key to ioun's location specifically but she could be tangible if you'd help us find her how many fucking bolts are there whoa cool oh i can't see inside of it trinket where's the imp where is the front door i know these trees are a pain in our butts oh no should somebody roll for pike 13 quidd dicks well we've got healers 24 what did she get well no but sprigg is right after scanlan he's before we are so i'd rather get him up before (sarcastically) i'm so glad he got those boots back i'm just so glad that's good they're at disadvantage now to hit you they are because you're prone i know right i'm going to run over to the window that those guys disappeared from right there yeah can i see that motherfucker did i see him run past the window all right then i'm going to shoot at him i'm going to hunter's mark him trinket doesn't have enough movement to get over by him does he i'm going to attack him with my bramble shot with the blazing bowstring ooh yeah that's a 31 yes okay do i get sneak attack on him i don't do i damn at least i got hunter's mark okay okay 28 plus my 4d8 piercing damage that's balls seven nine plus nine is 37 37 points of damage does he roll a dc of over 17 a strength save nice then i am going to shoot him oh wait i didn't add my blazing bowstring damage eight more for the blazing bowstring and then i'm going to shoot him again i'm just asking do you get sneak attack damage if they're restrained that's okay eight plus 14 is what 32 oh gosh okay ten 11 12 13 plus sneak attack 13 what's that ten so 23 and then hunter's mark plus one 24 i'm going to step away from the window no against the wall trinket is going to run over to sprigg and scanlan just to the guy just try to growl at him and scare him because he can't attack him what about the magician guy did you know that i was shooting at somebody let's try to save those books before they all burn is she doing it to the magician oh no all of his stuff oh really i didn't realize it was that big 28 hits 22 hits halved okay so 11 plus six is 27 points at the necromancer you get a grit point back you get a grit point back well then you're welcome 14 psychic damage 4d8 you only got 16 on 4d8 that's in the new campaign guide super disadvantage only when you're stuck under a tree on fire i'm going to hunter's mark the big undead monster in the room and then i'm going to shoot him with the blazing bowstring oh but i'm going to use the sharpshooter thing which i don't know if i should have done that on this particular one it was 17 to hit five plus eight is 13 plus sneak attack because he's got trinket next to him 13 18 23 sorry 23 and then lightning damage 24 25 26 and then blazing bowstring god dang 27 i'm going to move forward i'm going to actually move toward the corner where keyleth is oh there is i'm going to step on him oh wow he hits me probably because i stepped on him (pain sound) fuck ah shit okay i'm going to hit the big hulking thing again oh okay well yeah i'm going to do the same thing with the big hulking guy 25 to hit oh i didn't add plus ten to the previous one thanks 14 14 plus six is 20 i think that's just 32 because i don't get sneak attack again i guess so but she doesn't have to hasted action thanks pike it's not a big deal you guys i'm going to have nightmares about that oh grog put him out fire's out i'm assuming what about the books can i go over to them and see if i can find some books i think percy would like 27 but how was he watching us is he scrying on us oh he's fucking scrying on us i lean out the window hey sprigg hi i do come in here i'll take them off your hands i'll cure you darling don't worry but he's one of those creepy ghouls that probably doesn't speak me and pike can heal him as i take the arrows out (sarcastic laugh) sprigg anything valuable in here that you want to save before we get you out of here yes no keys to ioun you know where she is i hope so too i cast cure wounds you healed 19 by the way trinket sits down next to him and stares but i'll turn around i'm leaning against the wall and staring at him now is you it is you so do you glow brighter the closer we get what's the deal here i think it's glown what if he's a tuning fork that's what i mean what no this is good i guess so is there enough of us trinket in the necklace quick see all that fucking shit was for nothing he's still alive feels pretty good doesn't it i give him a kiss wait what it's skin books i can't read that dear we should maybe find ioun don't you think is sprigg still glowing i wonder if we could follow the glow warmer i'm going to walk with percy oh and trinket's out i know i know dear he heard wait who did you tell percival who did you tell what (screams) no percy a bit vague scanlan what did he say why is that bad why was that angry oh i feel like pike would've comforted him hi how's it going it's so hot in here it's very hot in here no it very much is i'm very glad i'm just surprised he didn't say anything i spoke with him i'm sorry i didn't tell you about that engagement but you know we got married (weakly) celebration thank you scanlan none of us have forgotten
