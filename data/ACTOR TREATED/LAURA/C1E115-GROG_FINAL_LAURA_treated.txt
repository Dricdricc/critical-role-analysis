while he opens it i'm going to take a sip of this fancy wine 13 does it make me breathe fire this-- what is it called this sandkheg is really strong you have to be very careful because it's jagged on

mark off a spell just be quiet i'm going to cast pass without a trace on all of us so that we're quiet i've already cast it i cast it already but roll a stealth check add ten to it i don't know what that means but i don't know why would you do that do you need help it looks like a butt with a staple in it where's trinket (gasps) grog trinket's here trinket's popping out of my necklace oh i have an idea can i shoot one of my oracle arrows and see what's in the other room i rolled a 45 32 it looks the exact same can we see forward can we see watch for traps you don't want to explode i don't know what grog has set up for us i would like to look around the whole room 34 for me can i use my broom to fly up and check out that hatch it's bars is it closed off can i try to pull them can i pull on the bars to see if i can get out because i'm really strong grog nine is there a lock to be seen i want to look and see ooh grog what a big word what is that 23 23 did you burp really stinky burp okay all right i'm going to follow them down the shaft behind percy and trinket's going to stand next to you grog because he loves you so much just move forward nice and easy oh no oh no back up scanlan back up yeah you should definitely suck the poison out no you should just suck it out oh no so wait so you saw darts coming out of the wall then okay so you guys i'll let you go ahead so we don't step on that section jump over it whoa 33 grog yes i would love to try and pull my brother to safety yeah a strength check oh gosh i'm not very strong grog ooh 22 what about trinket and grog i'm going to say that's a 14 for trinket grog save him as he falls does it sound like ghosts that we have encountered oh no 24 oh i'm going to shoot an arrow at it from a blazing bowstring because why not 25 shit 25 okay oh jeez i'm going to decide what i should you know attack should-- sure ten plus-- oh i didn't hunter's mark him because i'm stupid 15 plus fire 15 plus eight is 23 and then for my bonus action-- can i have trinket jump across the thing that he just crossed and attack the ghost too although i don't think i can actually have him attack after i shot an arrow yes i can because i only attacked once that's how it works that's an 11 for him that's a lot can he continue his attack probably not can i attack with my second arrow your second luck of the day you've used two of them is he a dwarf ghost because he seems rather short he is a dwarf ghost i only got one arrow you only get one dagger back towards the tip maybe you should push on it percy trinket's going to run over damn it he has to cross the thingy again i'm going to shoot another oracle arrow into the lit cavern i do i have one more 26 there's a furry shape there's an animal in there let's go in i walk into the room oh no we all fell over jesus h that's lovely grog where was the furry creature i'm going to look at the ground and see if there's any traps 12 great then i walk forward towards the fountain and past it thank you scanlan do you want this to be a dog grog can i cast speak with animals i want to and i want to talk to him i want to say hey dog what are you doing down here oh shit i immediately shoot an arrow at him but i want to hunter's mark him first i'm not right on him but i'm not right up against him fucking dick scanlan fine 26 oh okay that's 16 plus six is 22 plus six is 28 i want trinket to run up and attack him too he does right oh he got a natural 20 that's really good so i happened to be in the same tavern that he was in i thought you would really like it trinket attacks him oh i don't know i know he doesn't do this very often he did ah okay so 2d4 plus nine because it's a claw attack okay where's my other-- there it is 23 i mean that's pretty great right i should have had him do that before me i could have gotten sneak attack damage with his claws oh it's boobies i thought it was an anus i thought it was an anus 14 does that hurt trinket standing right next to him yeah that's a really cool dagger trinket did more damage than that 23 scanlan what the fuck asshole who all is in that cone oh no that's terrible for both of us well not bad for me 18 18 for me trinket though is a four he's not very dexterous oh no your health how much health do you have oh right here right there jeez trinket's pretty close to dying oh shit that's really low roll high darling oh okay i'm going to-- trinket is going to bite him back because he's a dick okay that's good 28 okay so he's going to do this ten for him does he get my hunter's mark as well all right just checking and then i'm going to shoot an arrow while he's doing that so the creature's distracted right well i mean he's not at the table playing right now so i have to say what he's going to do no he's right behind me yeah he's right there i got 31 no 31 to hit you're terrible 16 17 where are they i don't know oh what did i say i was at 13 okay good 13 16 17 yes i killed it it's dead trinket and i killed it good job darling thank you i want to run my hands through the fountain just so we can do this in the fountain water oh no 14 oh good okay so i'm going to wash my hands off shut up that's-- no he really shouldn't do you have any dessert do you have servants making any dessert in here in the mansion yeah well six because we might have extra trinket 20 platinum oh my god can i see some platinum too can i go over there i look for other secret doors okay 25 yeah is it a monster or is it platinum does it look like platinum okay can i look at it 29 aww grog it's a fountain what's that door on the far end trinket's going to join him trinket's going to bite scanlan's shoulder oh that's not my attack it's trinket's attack 19 great okay this is what you get scanlan 14 yeah he doesn't brush his teeth (bear growling) i don't think you should you should check out the door he unbites you and licks your shoulder which really just adds more bacteria to it what was outside of the door we go through it i want to walk towards the structure all of us i rolled a one let's see what trinket rolls that's cocked trinket rolled 18 what about grog what a nice journey that was i really enjoyed that what is this oh look at all those carpets do they fly is this heaven really just vax then are those doors or are those windows on the side what are we standing on they look like they have different symbols on them oh shit but i know oh no that's terrible yay can i walk up to the door in front of us yeah well maybe there's one in the room with the-- is that a money symbol can i go in the money room yeah yeah is it locked well i have it now too darling maybe a circle for percy because there's a circle on his glasses five gems on each door or five gems one gem on each door can i push on the glowing gem can i push on all the other ones can i pull the glowing one out is it grog is grog farting behind me what is that thing you rolled a natural 20 against me oh fuck you yeah is it trying to be like me is it going to take the shape of me trinket runs up and attacks him from the other-- right trinket runs up behind him i hunter's mark him and trinket bites him yeah natural 20 oh why doesn't he do this in real life ten 19 19 damage na-na-na-na-nineteen okay then i am going to for my attack use my rope of entanglement on the doppelgänger yeah is grog a doppelgänger strength 16 aww that's bullshit no 16 to hit doesn't hit me okay i'm going to kick him in the crotch i don't want to use that one i'll use this one that's terrible wait what do i add is this just a regular attack oh well that would be a two okay shit trinket's going to attack him he's going to bite him so that is 25 for trinket 12 yes i'm going to go doppeljenga yes ooh that hit me what are these weird sounds coming from you fuck all right 52 points of damage so far fuck kill him just a little less ooh maybe just flick him in the forehead what grog's been a doppelganger this entire time oh good we can eat our sherbet or whatever it is that we got who made all those little stick figure drawings really aww that's awesome regerts no regerts oh my goodness [break] oh yeah yay ooh that's probably important i wonder if we touch it too many times without knowing what we're supposed to do if they like explode and then we can't open it at all oh but all of us reach for a door at the same time what about scanlan's door are there any jewels lit up on your door really yeah well no no keyleth is dead in the game so all of us should touch a door at the same time yes wait at the same time i'm not touching it yet i let go of it because i got attacked by a doppelganger did i i did well i was getting attacked so i'm assuming i'm going to wait until other people grab their handles and then all of us can time it so scanlan should go to the triangle do we touch it on three or do we touch it after three on three or after three all right one two yeah ooh okay oh you're a cube because you've got a dick that's a cube and maybe vax is-- --a triangle because he stabs percy you have circle glasses right that could be something one two we're so smart i go in is there a chest i check for traps okay 14 what about the chest is it trapped 18 can i open it oh is it a mimic or is it a chest what's it look like oh okay what's that circle on the table behind me is it bars or is it solid i took my potion right i'm going to stand at the corner of my room and aim-- my room this corner right here and aim up at the hatch is anything happening yeah does it look like there's a lock on the hatch does it look like there's a handle on the hatch does it look like it opens outward or inward to the chest (laughs) 16 scanlan you're going to die from a rug but you can't reach your earring so nobody can hear you saying it yeah we have to touch our earring in order to-- it's kind of the thing can we hear him can i hear him i can hear you darling i can hear you darling what's up i've got a hatch too scanlan vax look up do you see a hatch dicks should i come in your room and look at your hatch or should i continue to look at my hatch let me give it a try they got so tired there it is the back being smothered by a rug that's your last one can i fly up and look at the hatch up close also can trinket come in the room he's going to stand in the other corner what can i see up close anything can i push on it can i get my fingers in and pull on it can i stick a dagger in at the edges and try to pry it open well he rolled two criticals and something happened what if i roll a critical ooh so close it was a 19 kill it that's a lot of lightning damage so warm 4d4 mine didn't have any creatures in it i like that you can sneak attack the rug it doesn't know you're there oh no am i still up at the latch am i still right at the latch well i said i was i never stopped being there can i push on mine my latch is open my hatch scanlan vax should we go in i do i bamf trinket into my necklace first is it another room or is it a tunnel grog you are so artistic we can see each other is that sharpie at the bottom of that pepper mill travis willingham can we walk over to it i want to walk over to it and kick it oh no eight points is it gone now or is it still there oh a pony yay 22 no don't attack me pony no i'm not going to it's so cute what do i have to roll to avoid it okay 17 it hits but i have uncanny dodge and evade which one do i use a strength saving throw if i use evasion does it still have to do that that was so fucking close 25 that's me are my hands restrained or is it just my feet i can't move my feet okay i'm going to cast grasping vine and i'm going to try to hook a vine around the unicorn and pull him back towards the corner right here he dies he's got legendary actions what a fucking dick fine well grasping vine is a bonus action i don't think he can resist it but whatever it's not like it's a spell effect he has to make a dexterity save nope not at all can i shoot him no i don't want to shoot him can i talk to him i want to say unicorn why are you attacking me i don't want to fight you i'm speaking in unicorn i'm speaking in unicorn grog how do you know it's not a language all right then i'm going to speak in normal and i'm speaking elvish i feel like unicorns might be able to understand i said elvish so i say why are you fighting me why i don't want to fight you i don't want to hurt you i love you that's my whole turn i don't think so it sounded kind of like a bird what that's so low how are you doing scanlan you really caught on no i have no idea-- doesn't hit that hits how do you know it is really pretty though scanlan that was scanlan yeah am i still entangled saving throw that would be 19 i'm going to use my bonus action to use the grasping vine again and try to wrap right around his leg and yank him back that is a dex save oh then he's restrained or he's pulled back at least yeah so it falls over it's all right and then i'm going to cast speak with animals although i don't need to because he already-- and i'm going to say you're a very good creature i know you're lawful what are you doing fighting me i'm good too anything no response okay just know that i don't want to attack you i'd rather just ride around on you because you seem really beautiful and then for my movement i'm going to hop on my broom and fly up in the air not quite to the top of the tower how high does the tower go i'm going to just go up 40 feet ooh you have them wait maybe flip it over that's it yeah (counting) i'm about ten feet higher than i should be he's also stuck in that position because of the grasping vine where where does he go oh no ugh it fucking hits me do need to make a dexterity save to see if i stay on my broom okay i'm going to take the greater healing potion which is 4d4 whoa that's a really good 14 points plus four right so 18 points healed and then i'm going to fly over the unicorn and drop down landing on its back and i'm going to use my rope of entanglement to make like a harness thing and hold on to the fucking unicorn like a fucking rodeo because he's lawful good okay that would be a one (laughs) i deserve that right back down to where i was before i healed but thank god i healed am i on my back or on my stomach no can i try to hang on i want to try to hang on to his hair well i don't need to roll the other one because it's a one oh no am i getting eaten by the unicorn thank you it worked i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself at 3rd-level can i bamf trinket out and see if he recognizes the scent can he smell for perception on the body to see if he recognizes who it is yeah he has smell perception he's got advantage on smell perception does that count no but it's a natural 20 damn it what does that mean okay (gasps) great so 26 what's going on sam i don't know i think he's dead yeah but i'm going to kill scanlan anyway i bamf him back out and heal him i cast cure wounds at 3rd-level what are you doing down on the ground yeah i leave him out and i cast speak with animals on him and i have another one you dick it only lasts ten minutes and i go trinket what happened scanlan did you kill my bear did you kill him why would you do that i try to put scanlan in the necklace i think he has to be willing so i don't try to put him in the necklace but don't i have to roll well i can but you have to roll a dc wisdom save ten balls well do i believe him it's just so weird that he got sick right after you gave him food is the electric field still up i fly up put trinket back in my necklace and fly up i'm going to join in 15 yeah we were just a little behind you that's how i pictured your mom singing it we're just fighting grog 16 yeah oh man i really should have healed up more shit how crazy will it be to go back to just rolling one die no hey percy leave some grog for the rest of us okay i'm going to bamf trinket out and run up to grog but he's not going to attack him yeah he's going to run up next to him i'm going to hunter's mark grog then i'm going to shoot him twice well i'm going to shoot him first hold on let's see if it hits 22 that's a bramble shot that's going to be 4d8 of piercing damage plus regular damage nine 17 19 plus-- what was that 19 19 plus five is 24 plus eight is 32 plus lightning 36 hunter's mark 37 plus sneak attack 43 46 damage on the first arrow and grog has to make-- like this is going to be really hard for him-- a strength saving throw he's restrained well grog is restrained what does a werewolf take silver oh fucking hell okay i'm going to shoot him again while he's restrained i already used it that definitely hits 30-something ten 12 15 15 for the second arrow and i fly up in the air kick up on the broom and fly up in the air that high sure why not maybe try to get him unconscious or something yeah i'm going to try can i use my last cure wounds at 3rd-level and heal him yeah i'll heal him for now and then pike will really heal him yeah obviously oh that game was so fun questionable grog that was great i have 200 red that was really good how do you plan the next move that you're going to do when every turn is your turn as well stroogle it is a stroogle and also we have scarves dual-sided scarves love you baby
