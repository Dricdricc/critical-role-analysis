my neck fucking something all right i'll take off on the broom after grog i followed too i am following as well i shout out don't go up there i fly down close to tooma and say quietly thordak has means of seeing through the stones up there if you go up top it's possible he'll be able to know that vorugal has fallen he might already know (laughing) yes and we thank you thordak the ancient he was commander of all of these dragons you are not beholden to us we ask this of your own free will all of tal'dorei is at risk it's true scanlan they did help a lot in that regard draconia has had a history of separating itself from the rest of tal'dorei this is an opportunity for you to welcome other communities to become part of the rest of the world you are strong there's some under the ice right here wait grog can i check for any traps or is it like totally fine because i've been here before and it's not pleasant investigation 18 what about the gemstones those are up high i'm staying away from those do you have dragon's breath just keep on punching it grog just punch it you're doing some good damage no we don't you might want to ask tooma if she has a problem with you taking all of draconia's gold any looking-magically thingies 16 inspire me yeah i only got 16 six extra points so 22 what color is the liquid another boots of haste for sure definitely boots of haste pair of boots out of brown leather you said ooh sheets of paper it is a natural 20 oh my god how's it feel grog speaking of money money money but if it's platinum it'll help we don't need any more than-- this is really nice how many gold is a platinum how many they don't need to know no i'm tempted this is amazing wait i can hear you oh you know what let's go back you lost me i'm out (laughter) okay all right how much we got 40 pounds of black dragonhide in the bag of holding yeah that's great did you take any healing potions if you did you'd have an empty healing potion vial i don't know how to i'd rather him not know right now that vorugal's dead because-- yeah maybe let's not do that just yet well if he does hopefully they'll be inside their caves i don't think he's going to leave emon to come check out what's going on with vorugal unless he knows that vorugal's dead well let's go back to the mansion maybe we can destroy it on the way out if we feel necessary what if there's a skyship in here maybe that's how the ravenites can get to emon if they can help us did it look like airship or normal ship oh right i have no idea maybe on the way out we can see if it's uncovered any more they've been working on this for a while now is it possible to wiggle my way in and check out the mast now 22 elvish common undercommon abyssal and draconic that's crazy it's a ship i'm coming back out i drop the bag of colding next to keyleth ah shit what do we do oh jeez we can't carry that we just got to go through the tree yo that's it what about the blood can anyone identify things in our group oh you can read it are you calling him a priss oh i bet kima would want the shit out of that i found a jewel it's red it looks pretty neato they were great about it actually they were quite generous wait it had runes on it as well do they look similar to the runes that were on greg-- grog's sword did it look fluid yes i don't know if it was an entire ship but it was a ship well i got down but most of it was still frozen we should check that out before we go it's so neat oh that's great you can make little clothes for it oh and these boots are they magic scanlan does it seem evil or good i want to put one on i just want to see what it does oh no oh that's painful here's a beautiful red gem it looks special the red beautiful gem you told me about what about the bracelet you also had a bracelet with a sapphire no you had a ring and you had a bracelet that is so insane i'm putting that in the party inventory the potion of invulnerability so we can decide later oh thank you is it boots of haste (yells) oh my god this is so crazy because i was about to learn a spell for somebody but these take care of that these are boots of feral leaping when you wear these boots you can instill your leaps with incredible bursts of power as a bonus action you can attempt to leap make a strength check with a dc of 16 if you are successful you leap either 15 feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally it doesn't say there you go grog you need those oh that's important i have a question because the spell that i was going to take because i still have one spell that i haven't learned yet is jump which triples your jump for one minute so if i did that would that triple that as well or would it just be grog's normal jump oh so that's perfect stealthy people need it probably did you just give away something amazing oh so it has to be a paladin she can do 100 push-ups whoa ooh to the back of it yeah sure is there a lounge in the mansion is there a bar so yes that's where we'll go we're going to go to the wine room how many charges are there oh how many recharge a day nothing it's going to be like three days for her to get them back don't do any more don't waste any more marisha don't do it that's why i said marisha pick the one that looks the fanciest i go to the corner-- the highest shelf i don't fucking know these are probably all fake wine anyway i fly up and grab the one on the highest shelf and fly back down oh no it's chicken wine fuck whatever we'll drink it anyway it's going to be disgusting that's funny fuck yes oh yeah right what's up thanks is that all you wanted to say i didn't think so yeah i think we have a good shot of it yeah i noticed yes scary i'm glad you're not dead oh i gave them to grog sure i jump it's a jump a normal little jump why oh yeah so tell me what you're procrastinating about oh you fuck (laughing) what (muffled) what are you even talking about right now do you want to see how high i can jump now so high i get on my broom and i fly up to the ceiling (groans) fine fine hi i don't know i don't-- what okay (nervous laughter) yes yes (sighs) it's just timing you know it's all timing this is true hmm his collarbone i think he isn't thinking that way at all and honestly-- i don't know darling it seems so trivial doesn't it yeah i do have happiness wouldn't it be so awkward though hmm hey i'm living a life i've got trinket i've got you sometimes when you're not with keyleth i know very few yeah (laughing) i want you to remember that you just said that oh don't thank you and i'll try oh i know well that's not true no keyleth they're like so close yes you do okay you want me to control him then get him under my thumb bring him to the light just a little bit i know what you're talking about (laughing) i thank you hm glug glug glug well all right okay have fun i pop trinket out cast speak with animals and have a nice fun conversation with him fenthras and then head back to whitestone i mean-- oh no we're fine in here sam and oh he's drunk you have so many you got it what is that should we go find out oh god this is ridiculous wait it's not a two yeah we're staring from the top of the stairs at all of it happening is percy still on her back piggy-backing grog it's keyleth (whispering) he's drunk oh that it's elvish i did it's impressive no maybe you need to rest yeah well pike is resting because she was hurt quite badly i didn't oh yeah you have a book do we keep our hit dice from our heroes' feast if we never got rid of them or are they gone i promptly rip the fuck out of my bill you can do that while we look at the ship yeah it's all in the same place right so you have to attune to that is it any bigger it's quite lovely isn't it you're welcome i did it for you keyleth i walk up to one of the guys going in and say in draconic have you unearthed the giant ship yet oh wow it had some engraving on it you speak a lot of languages right pike speaks dwarvish can we get inside of it is there anything to see inside of it (hums the jeopardy theme) grog go punch it natural 20 i hope there's really something in here we should get out let's go really did you really do that 29 yeah i see it can you get her out isn't it buried completely at this point maybe it was one of vorugal's first kills or something and it's sentimental like a blankie he was a nautical kind of guy he's up top (groans) it's-- did you see it it collapsed good i know i'm looking at you i'm looking in your direction ugh goddamn it yeah you saw them under the ice you saw a couple under the ice where were the other ones were they there before it collapsed fuck we should tell tooma that-- i go find tooma tooma you know the stones we talked about yeah they got jostled it looks like that ice wasn't super-strong and it collapsed not sure exactly but you should keep an eye on the sky if you see something red maybe hide just for a while thordak doesn't know what was here but if he realizes vorugal's been killed he'll come looking potentially oh yeah with your help i think just in case he comes before we get to him good plan not the time (whispers) fucking dick stop it of course we all need to go up there anyway because that's where the trees are that we're going to transport through right we make our way to the top of the ravine as well eight hours so you're pretty hungover you don't have a lot it disappeared that's amazing oh what what he's got a really high modifier though as soon as the cube comes out can i talk to you do you mind stepping away no not you how are you after dying no there hasn't it's a lot in a few days no not for a while i don't think yes no i have to tell you something do you know what fenthras means it comes from the elvish words i'm surprised growth and protection it's odd that saundor had it for so long since he was quite the opposite of that don't you think yes i don't know i think he focused for so long on the betrayal of his love on all of the horrible things within himself that caused that that he became the physical embodiment of it and i think he was trying to do the same thing to me even though i refused him i could feel those seeds being planted self-doubt and loathing echoing in my mind every night reliving every wrong that people have done to me and everything i have done that's actually what i wanted to talk to you about in the fight with ripley your last words to her were i forgive you it was such a surprise i pull out fenthras and i show him what i've carved onto it it's sinaeth do you know that word it's forgive i carved this on fenthras because that's the key isn't it it's the only way to really grow it isn't whoever that boy was that created those things that suffered such horrors that he felt they were justified you have to forgive him too because everything you've suffered and endured and created in that time has made you into the person you are now and you have a brilliant mind and any darkness that might cloud your vision on occasion the fact that you found it within yourself to forgive her means that it will never overtake you he's terrible isn't he just the worst maybe he's probably hiding somewhere i agree and this engraving is a reminder that every time i attack it's not out of vengeance never did you see the bear that i carved on the tree it's quite lovely thank you that's all there's no room we're in the woods oh man oh man thank you backblaze
