your hand underwater nott like a dolphin let's go to the docks is it big enough for all of us that's true yasha could put the ring on yeah and you'd be safe in the boat surrounded by water in the ocean maybe i should too because you know i'm watery now yeah i am blue and that's the same color as the sea hey yasha this is the sea it's pretty huh oh so you were lying what i like that i get in the water go ask your sailor friend fjord yeah get back out and go ask him where the sluice is woo yeah it's still wet was he telling the truth how do you know it's my fault i'm sorry i yell from the water oh that's not bad i love imagining beau in the outfit that she's in freaking wraps on her arms wait wouldn't it be funny if that was marius she lives inside of you i guess so do we see her like clarota like (brain-sucking sound) don't worry nott if you fall over the side fjord and i will catch you are you saying what you see caleb are the bars rusted did they seem rusted at all is there any air between the water and the grate getting bored sitting in the water out here hey yasha let's go try to break through that grate get him back here and let's try to get through that grate he looked through frumpkin's eyes and there was nothing i flick him in the back of the head three times well frumpkin wasn't getting sucked in was he no i want to go try to break through the grate hold on to spr-- oh i can't do it i'm afraid you are going to eat my weasel you promise me you won't eat him don't eat the puppy either promise promise no nott (laughter) okay let's go oh yeah let's get a hand on it and brace our feet against the tunnel and on the count of-- it was a practice count what'd he say let's roll independently (pointedly humming) she's really strong did it seem like it was hard to hold our breath while we were doing all of that yeah let's try the other one really ooh nice okay we try to go to the second one and break through okay so this time i'll be more specific i'll go hm hm hm and then we pull it yeah one two three pull yeah one two three pull yeah natural 20 (cheering) 23 hot i say about myself up and up up and breathe so are you oh well that'll totally-- oh no the animals oh god no it's going to die no i don't want it to die and the dog is just on the boat ay you made it ah sprinkle where's nugget i really should have left the puppy with my mom and we tied the boat yeah oh god yay yay nugget we have really good pets i'll put him in my hood and stuff and warm up what if the water comes in while we're in here we should probably hurry up then huh we could try can we get our fingers in let's try it can we try to bust it out nine can we see through it at all what's in there does it seem like water is ever up along the walls or does it seem like the water is always at the level it's at 18 okay i think we're safe oh no no it doesn't count because i'm up two now 18 i did i got 19 thank you okay i'm going to cast spiritual weapon woo it's pitch dark so all of us can see right above next to beau yeah and i'm going to hit it or i'm going to try okay i'll shift to my left (singing) to my left to my-- yeah 14 11 points of damage and then i'm going to toll the dead on him a wisdom save (yelling) 2d12 11 points of damage it vibrates through the water suck a bag of dicks water creature (laughter) oh no oh no 17 except for nott bring my spiritual weapon down that's 16 that sucks this plus four is five and then i'm going to use guiding bolt at the other one and i'm assuming-- tell me if i'm wrong-- because it's a flash of light that streaks towards the creature that would give enough light for caduceus to send something out all right okay so how do i do guiding bolt 11 plus seven 18 that is 4d6 15 yes advantage on attacks against that one advantage what the heck is that tell us what it means science there's a treasure chest it's engaged to me it's not terrible fjord i am your dream he's really good at it you never know what where does that next tunnel go splash splash splash i'm going to kick through the barrel while he's doing that did i find a gold let's keep booking and nugget's going to run up and try to bite and play with frumpkin oh shit it's a foot and a half nugget come back here blink to me darling blink to me ooh that is a 23 blink to me nugget yeah (gasps) i'll take a really good bath when we get back oh no no oh no like monsters more of those water things maybe we could get up to those little terraces or something and avoid it can anybody walk on walls what if we don't touch the water what if all of us hang on the side of the walls and move around the room i cast pass without a trace do i have that i do yeah i cast pass without a trace on all of us we're going to stealth right because i just cast it on all of us yeah and i give caduceus the blessing of the trickster you get advantage add ten 19 i want to listen but i shouldn't listen how far away is algar from us i bet it's his necklace zsundie has a necklace on and he's like-- not zsundie i want to fight algar oh melora did you think we were going to get to this you sounded like bob ross as he was saying that it's all happening nicely no we haven't come in yet we were all hiding in this little thing i'm putting you in the back nott so you can hop up oh that's true that was our lineup so how far is that (humming along) they have high constitution that's what you said so they probably have pretty high he's glowing nine the fancy one the tall one it came off again yeah go for algar oh things are happening but it looks pretty yeah that's it yay matt good job matthew moist marisha and fuck butt tug your shirt over beau but it keeps them from going back yeah ugh he heals yeah he took damage from you you you were using my dice okay i'm going to walk forward as far as i can like here can i get here okay i'm going to invoke duplicity 30 feet in front of me well i'm sure right around there yeah then my duplicate is going to cast spiritual weapon at what's his fuck at algar yeah but i can see where he went it's 120-- yeah still the lollipop but razor blade edges i'm going to try to hit his arm and chop off his arm natural 20 (cheering) did that work did i chop off his arm because that's what i was trying to do i'm hoping it hits him ten damage my duplicate goes ha ha too yeah sure (singing) on d&d has a necklace on but algar has a bracelet on that's controlling it it's a collar did i chop off his hand can you tell damn it yes put that one away for a while you don't know you don't know you don't know oh fuck okay oh but can i make her like fall probably not because it's not my turn he's bringing out the hentai but it was in darkness right so none of us actually saw it that was such a gentle roll we don't want him to die okay okay yeah yeah so don't worry so can he drown and then he stabilizes and then he drowns and stabilizes that's must be stressful okay i'm going to step forward i'm going to stay away from the water thing i'm going to use my duplicate to go forward and touch caduceus and she's going to cast cure wounds at third level so that's 3d8 so that is (counting) 19 points of health and then with me i'm going to sacred flame for myself just kidding (giggling) i'm just going to flail around with the spiritual weapon and hope i hit something it's okay it's a 15 but the other one was a natural 20 mm-hmm i'm going to move my own person towards caleb yeah i'm going to move me towards caleb oh he does oh i didn't realize it was within range he doesn't hit me i have a shield (clanging) okay yeah (gasps) could i have used my hellish rebuke if he didn't actually hit me yeah i want to use my hellish rebuke actions yeah screams ahh sounds like what you defend your mom come on i heal people ooh zsundie zsundie zsundie is it attacking me that was an aggressive roll seven okay okay does he do damage to me at all hellish rebuke that is yes dexterity no it's not yeah it's a 12 half damage okay so that's still 3d10 of cold damage (counting) 11 and what was it 13 damage okay we're still alive oh no okay is he dead is he dead yet yay okay no i don't want to though i'm going to-- you're still unconscious though-- okay i'm going to cast (singsong) cure wounds at third level on caduceus that's right 18 plus four is 22 points of health (singsong) then for my bonus action i'm going to swing around with the-- oh i can see now but i still can't see anything that's around there that's okay (slurred) just going to do it again 19 12 points of damage i'm going to move to where i'm not in a line with these people i'm going to hop over as far as i can that way then hide right there you can stand up bracelet pull his bracelet off (screams) nice don't cut his hand just take the bracelet maybe he's coming to thank you maybe that means that the city's going to be without electricity if you put-- oh fuck muscle girls
