it's got futurama stuff on it but it's not fans don't get to vote more than it was sam walked away so he wouldn't be on the same set as you were saying that oh yeah i think we need to spend at least the night in whitestone and get up in the morning there's more coming dear sorry you can't be out having your fun dear maybe we can stop through on our way back we are going to marquet aren't we gilmore gilmore's from marquet it's up as long as the dragon's not here and attacking how are we even going to get a beast i think a large enough beast to attract vorugal he said they hunted remorhaz oh those are big and scary and vorugal will go to the creature i know because i'm an expert we could ask zahra but she's busy with research yeah let's go find kashaw did we ever talk to cassandra or anyone else about starting an alarm system here maybe he's not the best messenger if he's training our armies all right it's not just a messenger it's defeating a dragon no we take a contract on a really large creature and then we let the dragon do the work for us we get the best of both worlds he hunts them that's what he does well then we're going to have to fucking go to the slayer's take this'll be great and vanessa really likes you thank you we have 40 pounds of dragonhide black dragonhide we don't have white dragonhide no that's keyleth's remember in the next century when she's still living no they do they lose a contract no if the dragon kills the creature and then we all die and we can't harvest it the slayer's take doesn't have anything from its previous contract well fuck it while all this is going on grog you could be training these soldiers seriously don't kill them grog hey bonus he's on our side eh that's encouraging yeah don't you have wings yes and make sure to include that this must all be completed within 14 days yes that's what he said that's part of that listening thing scanlan kashaw no mention of whitestone at all anywhere you go very important do we have a way to get him there very quickly he's a really smart man yeah but then he'll pop where we are don't worry about it don't you want to walk with them so now that that's handled are we leaving today we've got a limited amount of time on this did it sound like anyone we knew is everything okay how are you holding up gilmore oh you got a whisper on a 15 actually the shirt you're wearing sam is from loot wear well we plan to go to marquet things have progressed much quicker than we expected it to and unfortunately we are on a two-week time crunch before all hell breaks loose how does his house look does it look together like it would normally be or does it look disheveled at all we are looking for a merchant warrior outside of you do you know of any very powerful merchants one with a missing eye we should talk to him to them we're very interested to start paying you for your service again gilmore and stop expecting it for free oh believe me i have as well this locket will take a nice little chunk off of that tally thank you do you have any to-go cups (laughs) just kidding i'm surprised you even know how many eight gallons is grog wow i walk off and look for jarett you can tell us all about where you're from actually did you leave marquet a long time ago oh really what did you do me neither (laughs nervously) have you heard about the den of drujah drujah it's unscrupulous all right it's like the man in black it's this famous tale of the princess bride don't worry about it like the dragon a very small town is it a long trek from there to the city wow shit do you remember in all your time there did you ever deal with-- this is completely ridiculous-- a merchant who only had one eye i can't even imagine you like that be pleased don't drink the water be pleased we'll work on it keep everyone safe i didn't realize marquet was like emon this might be a bit difficult to find a one-eyed merchant in a city bigger than emon this is true we've only got two weeks fuck oh but are we going to get some water jugs and shit like that before we leave we need to get some potions how many jugs did we get five jugs and we fill up our wineskins with water you're going to be a gross sweaty greasy mess over your other cloaks perfect thank you gilmore anywhere can i get a little dagger through and flip the latch drink good thing no one destroyed this thing while he was gone every carpet here i look under the bed can i reach them is the box trapped almost good and then not 14 can i open it is it gilmore's stuff i'm just seeing if this is his room okay i fold them back up and i put them under the bed i was seeing if we were in gilmore's room that's all yeah don't act like i'm a dick i'm not stealing the letters i'm putting the shirts back all right is the door open can we go out of here shaun he's quite well he's very powerful actually and has wonderful businesses all through-- no i know it's just not there anymore he does so well yes very respected actually we need to head out pretty quickly can you tell us the direction to ank'harel yes thank you i'm assuming these are the people that gilmore said i would know yes so as she's doing that i want to pull out the locket and say actually shaun asked me to deliver this to you thank you i understand oh yes can you give them some water from our jug would you like some water what time is it here no we aren't going to make it to ank'harel by dark yes of course that's all thank you you broke him yeah unless we see any kind of potion shops here let's mist it that would be the worst thing ever let's do it as i turn into mist i go i'm melting melting oh what a world 20 eight hours right it lasts eight hours can we get the whole way there yeah i've got an excellent sense of direction and we can camp just outside the city maybe should we mist down it's still night it's good to camp we mist down a little bit and the gates to the city are closed at night can we see guards around do they look aggressive we can see your piece of paper on the screen still see it we should probably land far away wine definitely wine all right shall we camp in the mansion then so comfortable yeah we're off a little bit do the people seem friendly do they seem tired 22 how about we keep a distance no let's keep a distance from them and be another group of people coming into the city no but they have to document who goes in and out can we have the mansion scanlan he already did that i'm going to watch you do it the guards are guarding anybody that approaches is a threat i stand in the doorway be pleased wait is magic not allowed within the city thank you for the warning magic is allowed but this is strange magic how will we know what isn't strange magic i hold the door open wonderful no i want to go to sleep and i'm holding on to fenthras and thinking about everything oh (retching) i go back in my room i'm about to throw up fine and i go in my room and i sit down on the opposite side of the room hold on it's not been a minute all right no i'm happy for you as foul as it is what are you doing what oh that was so amazing (soft laugh) jesus christ really right now he knew a lot of things yes i don't think he was completely wrong and that's what makes me feel terrible well he was right about the dagger that's good because i am really weak (laughs) thank you thank you it makes me happy to see you happy yeah right oh that yeah i killed a couple people and i saved trinket that's all do you remember when i brought trinket back to camp yeah all those years ago (laughs) well turns out i found him in a camp where i'd been taken yes and there was some really dark people there and they had harvested-- trinket's mother bless you is scanlan in the room i did what i had to do and i killed them yes i did yes and i saved trinket that night and that's what saundor saw more than anything i just i don't know how he saw it i'm not right (sniffles) rung it (laughs) no it's good we all need to self-reflect every once in a while i needed it my heart is in the right place i know it is i'm just afraid sometimes actions speak louder than intentions if things i was doing could be read the wrong way then maybe i need to change what i do it's fine dear (laughs) no please i'm so happy to see you happy don't worry about me i'm fine and i can talk to trinket now we talk all the time we've talked through a lot right yes (laughs) i love you should you need me oh yeah no maybe go take a shower yeah maybe something other than chicken something with veggies oh they speak they're learning delicious how about no this is the ploy it's a million is anybody looking at trinket weird or is it okay he's with us the suncut bazaar yeah as we look around do we see any markets actually the shopping district would be a wonderful place to look for-- i'm not looking in the direction i'm keeping my eyes on them the entire time he's talking 20 no we walk towards the suncut bazaar keeping an eye out are the shops here indoors or are they outdoor tent markets do we see any spice merchants 11 i peek around her shoulder where would the shade be thank you so much no going up from that that's what it is what are you looking for can i have seen percy looking around can i help him look what are you looking for dear it's very colorful what sorts of things investigation 19 want to walk up yeah no actually we sit down in front of him should i put five or 15 for each of us with one eye can i insight check him as he's reading the cards see if his face twitches at all if it looks like he's making shit up 21 okay and the third question goddamn it five more gold i as quietly as possible put another five gold in front of him did i make the right choice be pleased that was so cool well that's the shade should we head that direction grog do you want to bring your rock fuck yes scanlan we're heading towards the shade it's the big green tent follow we're at the shade you have drugs with you did scanlan get here yet are we staying here it's not very private can i find a patron that seems chill i walk up be pleased actually just a small trifle are you staying here lovely we're

grog taliesin and scanlan spice dealer are you going to wear red well i'll go with you of course i'm cool i'm so cool darling do you think maybe the reason jarett was almost arrested was because of

wonderful beverages you just served us how long does that last just a tiny bit fabulous they came with quite a price tag didn't they i could assume what exactly is in i'm assuming i mean back in the city that we're from-- thank you so much where we're from usually when purchasing such a great and expensive item room service is included i'm assuming we have somewhere to stay for the night oh cultural differences good to know we need to go find the debt's respite and maybe get a room that's where the scarbearers are we can get a room here 26 but they said this was being guarded by the hand of ord interesting no the guard at the front of the city told us this was one of the places that you could stay and it was guarded are they wearing a cloak so they don't have something up do they have a hood over their head tail or no tail wow i guess i walk up to the tavernkeep i grab one of the barmaids who do we speak to about a room oh well there we go i walk over sorry sir we're interested in

trying to pace near the door that she went through so i can keep an ear on the door can i hear anything from the other side of the door i didn't want to have my ear against the wall i wanted to be
