no yeah that's what we think all the time and really believable i just want to look at it but you said i had to show it it's so pretty wait we can show it are we going to show it did you just steal the comic book is it still there sweet yeah level six i walk around and crunch all of that frost (crunching) i don't think so no is it always full or it is always almost empty you don't have to buy alcohol at all anymore that's wonderful how do you decide which alcohol is in it what if you get sick of it you can't empty it out what if you want to try a different thing like-- yeah maybe we shouldn't do that right before we go to the swamp where we're going to fight people you can't really waste it maybe you should try i find a stick open up i don't want to hurt your throat you know but do you feel better though do you want me to stick something down your throat we beat them though is it normally ogres that ambush you one more time that was very believable caleb i think i've ever seen does anybody else want to drive the cart today or do you want me to keep driving it yeah not the slowest pace a normal pace i want to stand on the cart and stand up for the ride and look around i'll put my hands on molly's horns and-- am i rolling twice nine because it's appropriate i'll sit down i've been standing for such a long time plus if we wait it'll take a really long time for them to cross the road let's go go we should stand up and ride it like a surfboard yeah did it break the wheel we could climb to the other side of the cart and try to balance it so the wheel comes up oh no is it fixable would we know i have an axe yeah and get all of our stuff off of the cart but i have our giant lead safe in here it's pretty heavy (gasps) i have mending i have a mending cantrip i have that you guys i can mend things thanks for reminding me on that molly yeah i can try it guys i'm amazing that would have been way more amazing if i'd remembered that i could do this let me try it on this other wheel though no i think the army would see it we should look like we're people that are peasants or something no we needed help because our family is in the swamp i push the safe off the cart i just bought it it's in the bag the good stuff's in my bag don't worry could you help us we are headed to this swamp place what does he look like load or loat max load got it thank you so much how long have you been a soldier thank you so much for your help do you need any help thank you so much stay safe everybody be safe actually it was faster than i expected could i try mending again and see if what they did made it to where i can fix it now oh no i'm wise 23 wait that's a lie that was a save 20 traveler be with us ta-da thank you right yes you see that caleb that's almost as powerful as the shit that you do have you seen my lollipop don't make me inflict wounds on you nott yeah and kind of painful probably well shit you're not awake this is why we should have taken that circus tent man are there any caves nearby i mean we're kind of by a thing did you guys wake us up because of the storm i'm assuming what is he looking for oh it's right there we're pretty far away does that mean that guy was named after a whole city does that means he owns a city matt travis and oh i thought that was his last name i'll take the next watch because i don't mind the rain just regular plain old check that's not bad 19 big one did you see that shit storm that's not that long of a walk quarter mile ah it's like a day at the beach we should get some waxed canvas or something there was a big one close by it happened right before i went to sleep don't know really so what kind of people-- so i should go i'm going to go get some of it too that's impossible you can't make something like that i fixed a wheel i could do it because i can make a giant lollipop i have lots of faith is it considered faith if you just really like somebody travis and oh no i want to ride on a horse today ugh it's going to suck even more because of this storm hey at least it's cold so there won't be a lot of bugs around normally bugs are terrible in swamps i hear right oh no and if you start to lose hope your horse sinks into the mud and it's gone forever oh i thought there wouldn't be insects because it's cold we're trying to find febron keyes that sounds like it was talking or did that sound like a bird should we call back maybe it's just a bird where's it coming from what area it's over there can we look can we see can we see into the swamp natural one ow i got a leaf-- no i think it's a leaf i use mending on my eye fjord will you look at my eye i think there's something still in here fjord get it wow my hero thank you oskar-- i mean fjord yasha starts throwing up but we're on horses was it a snake i really want to see what it is oh you don't have a bird you have a cat some poor fish is going to try to eat that maybe we should call out and see if febron is here maybe it's a call but the safe house is in the swamp it's not in berleben right maybe we can climb a tree are there any tall trees can i start climbing a tree sure 21 it was a really good one if it hadn't been perception ten i cast guiding bolt on the reptilian creature it's 120 feet distance and you said that the bog is 100 feet away it's a-- shit sorry guiding bolt plus seven okay ah 4d6 ah eight ten 13 don't worry we'll save you there's a thing and it's trapped and there's the reptile thing that's going to eat it over there i point and i start climbing over and try to get to it it's about 100 feet away don't worry guiding bolt is an attack thing so i have to roll to attack oh no okay it definitely hits it's plus seven 16 23 yay i'm so glad we checked out what it was oh shit oh my god look at all these trees oh no it's really big look at that teeny little bird guy what ah shit our fate point we have to focus on it in the morning that's really smart we'll just say we pass the coin let's hope nobody dies in this fight yes 14 14 i can go oh gosh okay i'm going to cast spiritual weapon oh shit that's right it's a 60 foot range how far can i get it that's true oh i guess i can run forward first before i do it i'm going to run forward and try to get up on that tree okay that's about as far as i can go wow i'm going to stand on that log so i'm out of the swamp matt and wait i can't get it quite that far can i hold on let me check one last thing before i definitely do that okay i'll put it as close as i can to it yeah that's my bonus action for my action i'm going to wait until it's close enough and then i'm going to hit it i'm holding my actual action to attack it no it's a bonus action that's dumb that was dumb on my part i'm going to hold sacred flame to cast on him ooh you could double dash that was really close though he's within range of my radiant blast now so i can attack him okay the sacred flame is what i meant to say dexterity of 15 oh wait do i get more because i'm level five now spell damage increases when you reach-- oh 2d8 yes oh good three whole damage woo i can mend the shit out of some wheels though bitches no yeah i was wondering why it was coming from the other direction no oh no what if it's a trap we should have got to it sooner hey man i'm up here i don't know it's not a bird no it looked like a person you guys that's wonderful oh no in gator okay oh god can i climb up on this tree right in front of me for my move yeah i was so afraid it was going to be a one 16 okay good i'm going to cast blindness/deafness at level three on both of the-- it's both blindness/deafness it's a con save either blinded or deafened okay shit yeah he's blind he's got a disadvantage on his attack rolls is that what it is that's good okay then i'm going to use my spiritual weapon to come up behind the other gator and smack him on the back okay someday i'm going to know what i'm doing no spiritual weapon is just up oh blindness/deafness blindness/deafness is not concentration yeah it's just a minute plus seven to hit that's 23 okie-dokie that is eight damage was that the one that is-- okay ooh he did are goblins reptiles why don't you take off the damage you did and reroll as eights okay i'm going to invoke duplicity as my action and i'm going to pop my little person down right behind the other side of the gator that yasha's fighting yes then for my bonus action i'm going to cast healing word on the little bird creature that's six my invoked jester turns around and thumbs ups to it that's all i can do nice nice oh gosh nott acrobatics oh but you still get advantage because you flanked no oh you get uncanny dodge again no sharks and bears oh no so it's even but he's the one that cast-- i have revivify i have lots of rings do any of them have diamonds in them how dare you i thought if i had my symbol of the traveler i've never done this before do you have a diamond that's worth 300 gold don't die anyone don't die i thought i could bring you back why do i have that stupid spell prepared if i can't even use it travis and look at you he literally marked them off no he totally came he's good he's a hero can i use my invoked jester my duplicate to run over to nott she can move 30 feet it wouldn't be encumbered because-- wonderful i'm going to cast cure wounds on you at you know-- at second level we're about to get a rest it seems stupid to-- oh it's cocked five plus four no it would be plus four plus four no it's 2d8 plus four okay yeah nine can i jump down and walk over to the little bird creature you guys ew that's really

eye out to make sure no more of those things come out oh no (sadly) we've got to get him to his family oh i don't know are you a-- girl bird kiri oh no how many sisters do you have (quietly) oh man where did you see the swamp people that you were talking about well you're how old she's got really good penmanship so i don't think she's four like human four most four-year-olds can't write like that yeah if she stays with us at least until tomorrow maybe i can send a message to your family and let them know you are okay right i have some pastries too if you like sweets are you going to throw-- i'm going to cast cure wounds on her before she does this eight a natural 20 got two points of damage whoa whoa should we cut open these giant gators and see what they have in their bellies i take my axe and hit it in the belly ugh ten can i realize that this was-- would i be able to tell from my medicine history that this is bird people like could you tell from the bones it's a lot of bird people oh no can they talk to each other whoa should we tell her there's three bodies were they big bones or little bones then they're really sad and they will be happy that one of their children-- yeah no we won't tell her that i was afraid that it was her parents but if we can let her parents know that she's okay then at least-- yeah well the traveler's been teaching me some stuff and i was asking him the other night about how i could thank my mama and stuff like that he taught me a little bit of how to send messages across distances i don't know i think if it's familiar enough then i can send it maybe if she describes them i could do it i haven't ever tried it i needed to send it to-- oh i have to prepare it there were three other kids you know blood all over my hands sure plus in the morning i can send a message to your mom and dad right we can gift you a horse and then you can go find them i'll carry this leather to the cart right i love her i love her sam and (cheers) i know she really is she's a baby bird a blep i love her so much sam and let's put a cloak over her so she looks a little less like a bird but now you don't have a cloak on i'll take off my cloak and put it on nott but it's a short cloak it's a little one don't worry yeah no that's okay i'm actually really warm right now i don't need anything it's not 85 degrees it's still cold here i put it back on caleb and tuck him into it kiri where was the city you saw the village of people we should go in that direction so we can locate febron keyes yeah we should probably look for an inn or something right we should look for the keystone pub is there anybody outside right now yeah excuse me lovely weather we're having huh okay i was wondering if you could point us towards an inn or the keystone pub maybe thank you can you sleep there oh i cast mending on the fountain is the wagon doing okay in the-- yeah looking for the big tower thing 22 let's go up there should somebody stay with the cart maybe because i feel like all of our awesome stuff that we just got will be taken this leather that we took-- kiri stay behind me a little bit okay don't make yourself obvious all right we need to protect you we can't leave her in the cart no no don't do not let this little bird girl have booze hi it's really cool he's a little bit high right now can i look around at the few patrons that are in here and see if any of them fit the description of febron keyes that was a shitty roll eight can i get up close to them and one by one we heard amazing things about this area and we thought we would check it out because we're travelers yes and we like to see different sorts of things and this is really an interesting area you know not many cities have a lot of water in them like this it's really cool-looking though downstairs whoa that could be so much fun is it submerged in water that's a lot more than you originally made it sound like yeah sure why not is there someone who can keep our cart do you have a place we can keep our cart well yeah keep it where where okay no i'll do it because i want to see the town sure no i can do it yeah where's the stable man i was going to look at everyone in here he's right here no we have to secure the safe house let's go wake him up just on his teeth you're so intimidating caleb really really-- was it gators oh well because we are really good at killing those what if we paid you 100 coin all right we could do that i just said coin i didn't make it clear which kind of coin 100 copper 100 silver okay 100 silver you got it that's one part of it taken care of all right upon delivery to the place no it's not it's really not it's a nine don't be a dick to us you already said you were scared of us bringing you back to the gentleman what are you going to do and you sing us a song on the stage and 12 yeah does everyone want to chip in a little bit of gold this is like sorting out a check at the end of a meal 20 plus 20
