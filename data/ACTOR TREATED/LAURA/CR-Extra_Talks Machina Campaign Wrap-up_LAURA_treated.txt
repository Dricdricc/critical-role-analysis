she's in green because we're vox machina well everyone likes the underdog right i mean that's why i mean he had been you know shunned by the rest of them so we thought he wanted to get even yes very much but it didn't mean we didn't trust kima we just also trusted (whispers) clarota yeah oh yeah that's right could we have gone into that realm and we all would have just died you didn't want us to have the carpet do you remember no stopped questioning i feel like that was one of the biggest things when we switched over and we started filming the show was we didn't want anything to change from the home game yeah yeah from the shits we had a reason for it because we knew we were going to be starting this stream he's like hugh in star trek from the borg i loved hugh how'd you get the scar though you had a scar on the boat yeah no no that happened before the stream we just had-- i think towards the end of the campaign you were like you may be running low on arrows what yeah he did yeah we had to deal with-- was the guy with the purple hair right was he arcana pansophical obviously (laughs) good ol' victor (laughter) yeah so much of the original characterizations came from kit like the feathers that wasn't me that was her all these little things that ended up becoming so-- yeah with our characters oh man that was the first time you went invisible wow damn i wonder how many times we've fucked that up like different relationships huh a lot of times next campaign still a bunch of dicks wait can we know that we can't know that ah it's underneath dalen's closet lower we have advantage and luck oh shit really dagger dagger dagger dagger that woman's haunted me for a while actually i think about that one a lot yeah great vomit how much did that gun cost i know you didn't you were magic weaponless the whole rest of the game that makes them even cooler no oh yeah the darling take the mask off that was definitely starting around then i don't know i think it attracted her to him more how fucked up is that (laughter) yeah sorry i can help him no it's just like edgy (laughter) i mean smoke came out of his body well that's half the fun is going halfway with it and letting him take the rest because you don't want to know all the mysteries you know the fun is discovering it see he's joked about this multiple times i think it might actually be honest that's awesome pretty freaking boss what a bitch he was a pretty bad guy how did his snake belt go missing in the first place oh i went and flirted with the guards i talked to matt about that-- sam liam and yeah i went and flirted with the guards and got it back for him i think there was a lot of winking involved i saw another snake belt this weekend and i almost got it for you i was like he doesn't need another snake belt now it's going to be another sort of thing it was a really cool snake belt though if i hadn't gotten you the other one i would have got you this one go scanlan so close you didn't have that many hit points at that point what would have been crazy is we would have gone to thar amphala and then we would have fought you undead maybe this is too much for her i don't know maybe vax and we dealt 50000 that's so much percentage of our damage dealt yeah if he talked me into it i would've left i would've fought him about it but if he made that decision and he was going to go i would've gone with him but we did it oh have we not answered this before oh man i found a bunch of love letters from gilmore and his first boyfriend so that's why i didn't tell anybody i just put it back because it seemed like okay this is personal it was a good confirmation though that we were actually in gilmore's bedroom because up until that point we didn't know for sure it was letters what good was it going to do if it had been letters gilded in gold i would have kept them but they were just letters i don't remember that purvan wait so we went and got pike's armor and fort daxio got destroyed what happened i don't remember a lot is that a later arc or is that the same time he had that weird like (uneasy noise) i liked him i really liked him you were so mad i saw spiders i have a similar follow-up question are there any more cookies because i really want a cookie yes i don't think i deserved that change in alignment (chewing) because it wasn't that bad (chewing) all i did was steal a broom steal a broom i was going to give him a whole bunch of dragon scales but he walked away too fast he did though i think it changed because matt misunderstood my motivations for things hey that's a good point no it was just because i wanted to fly you just have it right there wait a minute you wrote 69 in that thing and then in the wrap-up episode you said you were in your forties or fifties really okay yeah but it didn't go to you right away yeah and then i gave it to him yeah and then i found out it fucking had wings mother-- i like that there's other vestiges in the world for the next campaign and we killed them all fuck we should have kept a baby dragon oh see so i had plenty left meh oh my god eagle only the ones that succeeded damn that would've sucked nah no i mean no once she got money that's what mellowed her out once she became rich enough that she didn't have to fucking worry about paying for things anymore she was like okay this is what it's like the rakshasa good thing she's so powerful she would've taken him down no problem i still have one in my inventory yeah yeah that's what you do you straddle somebody when you give them your heart we didn't talk about how we broke up we broke up and then got back together and then we got married yeah it was very private trinket was there it was in front of the sun tree they kill you so everybody that was there got caught oh how did we say this happened i think it was we were out on a walk and then we were talking about marriage let's just do it let's just go for it yeah it was very spur of the moment it's not like there was a proposal and then we had a whole thing it was like should we do this let's fucking do this and then we did it did we say you asked as a joke or i asked you as a joke and the other said yes we should probably get married then huh yeah no tary knew before anybody else did though because he was in the house yeah sorry bro you were going to get told yeah everybody's going to hate me now not everybody ashley really tried making fucking forfeit counterfeit furniture as a gnome wouldn't it have been a two-handed weapon for him i don't even remember telling you not to get married it was a bad time for all of it to come out it really did it looked so good yeah we were scooby-dooed can i ask you a question that does have nothing to do with that but the fate die kind of reminded me of it did you have plans for the hag cashing in the favor from vax i would go hunter's mark but i think it's pass without a trace i really thought it was pass without a trace from here on out it's guiding bolt up the butt it was a scaling sort of thing yeah sylas has a pretty shit existence at this point which is nice harold his name was harold oatey_goat those things were in the way yeah that's one of the things that we talked about later in life they made peace with each other she worked to rebuild that relationship that came from having five kids with percy and going oh this is what family means this is what having children means it suddenly became very important in a different way to reach out to syldor i'm gary dried poo in there forever i have the kevdak skin in the bag of colding just a big piece of skin shut-- true what the fuck oh cows talking to trinket for the first time flying fucking flying scanlan was pretty impressive the whole fricking time let's be honest
