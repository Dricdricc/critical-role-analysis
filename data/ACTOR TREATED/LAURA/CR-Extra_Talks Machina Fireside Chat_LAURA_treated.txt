happy new year a lot of us went abroad it's a good thing it's not colder in here i don't think the tape is doing its job i can still see them that’s true but i can say that it’s going to be very soon no it really is gonna be super duper soon i just talked to fernando today about it and it’s coming up you’ll be happy how’s that happening do we know yet are we allowed to say what we did has everybody played oh my gosh so we're the only ones who have done it oh gosh my hardest one is that i kept wanting to say darling as i was talking i caught myself do it out loud one time and i was like ooh i really need to not do that i'm happy with my roll she rolled some pretty fucking low numbers matt oh i want to know hold up fingers underneath the couch so i can see what it is she could be a villain in this next campaign if you hadn't run blindly in-- no you got him off of somebody nithfluflop it's true i think that was the moment when i was like i'm in love with scanlan not vex laura i totally thought that she was going to make us do that i guess i'm pretty happy that she didn't' because i don't-- i'm pretty sure that we would've died before we got to vecna if we did go and fight orcus yeah aw i volunteered all of us together i also as me and as vex had no fucking concept of what orcus really was when i offered that like at all it wasn't until afterwards i was like hey matt can i learn some stuff about orcus because vex is doing a lot of research after she did that and he was like okay he sent it over and i was like oh no this is impossible (laughter) we're doomed yeah oh that's right we didn't we didn't ever talk about that i don't remember ever hearing about what happened to keyleth's mother i like to imagine she's alive and living under the water with one leg because her leg was discovered and that's the only thing that was recovered right so i think she's a pirate with a peg leg now how fucking cool would that be that’s what i think happened yeah what if we just completely fuck up and-- oh i love that game cooking mama taught me how to correctly beat eggs yeah do it and then switch oh my god do it again do it again those glasses that whole day it's like are we in a cult are we in a cult right now i've seen that it was a great place no that is what it is we’re just not going to call it the taint rules just what does your gut say just answer i was thinking sudoku i don't think so did she know about-- no she didn't know about him no yeah that was obviously we talked about that in our best friend hangouts like who do you like right now right i did i imagine that she did a lot of talking i am so glad you're here because nobody ever wants to hear these things now i am regretting not saying yes but then some of the downsides too which would have been real bad yeah i would have been dead fighting thordak there's no way i would have survived those super south yeah but i would have gotten some sweet tree loving saundor i would have gotten some saundor loving ooh there's got to be some fanfic online some ent fic yeah yeah i was going to ask when are you going to say that part yeah did that ever happen did you ever get werewolf grog that's right i remember that k'varn the mime box that's what he was talking about you were just rolling so bad no that was some good strategy in that fight hey that's going to be the first one he never used it probably at this point she'd be able to do some pretty badass-- yeah the minute you attack you would have been visible again is it just blood poop i guess a support just like making some bedrooms in there and summer homes yeah i think they opened up chains yeah eventually an ank'harel location tax-free plus think about it they're friends with gilmore so he's telling them how to do stuff they got to like-- like barnes & noble with a coffee shop (yelling) that's what happened you're screwing up our slayer's cake yeah that's great that's it we shouldn't have eaten all of those beans and stuff before this no because that's what there was to eat right it was beans i don't feel like your sessions are as long as our were right because we went like twelve hours brother we had a twelve hour game that sounds amazing did we ever talk about this yet it happens all the time actually this was way before that take me instead you spireling bitch i remember you talking about this i was like what the fuck are you-- so there's some guy that looks like me that's probably in a cage somewhere so if he ever breaks free there's another vex in the world i remember you saying something about tongues and i was like that's fucking weird bro i think that's acceptable i would've done it here's my theory about doppelganger vex later in life she found the doppelganger and hired him/her because the paparazzi gets overwhelming for the de rolo family everywhere you go so she's the lookalike that goes out fine but when she does she'll hire them the pronunciation of the names are getting worse and worse it's nugget-- --nugget north-- no those are two names nugget north-- yeah salsa percival fredrickstein-- bacon that's a good one bacon and then percival fredrickstein the fourth i kind of want to name them though we'll name a few of them percy percy percy percy percy you're like the cat with the thing on its head out of all the things that taliesin has worn this is the one you are getting the shit for we did talk about this too i think we said that they probably would have eventually come to it but it would have taken a lot longer yeah for a while for a good long while yeah and you did hear what she said yeah isn't it so weird that so often the guests got the killing blow i liked that the guests got them yeah totally i'm going to throw something at you for that sweet sweet sphinx loving for the new campaign you mean yeah those are not even close i have seen a couple people online that got everybody right i've seen like two people that got everybody right but it's pretty impressive i think i saw one person who got-- ten minutes
