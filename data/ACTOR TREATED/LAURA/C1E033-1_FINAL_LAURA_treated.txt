and i find scanlan so question when you cast seeming on us our visual-- if you made me look like a cow would i seem like a cow when i bumped into you or would i seem like a human no i'm saying that if something was different-- i think that old woman was doing something weird because she looked like she had full handses but-- full normal sort of hands but i didn't feel them her hand touched me but it didn't-- so she was doing some sort of-- i guess it's good that we left her then i don't know i don't know can you dispel seeming yeah i'm far away from her now i think she had seeming cast on her i don't know if she did it herself or if-- well i don't think she was what she appeared to be so you can do dispel magic stay in the shadows keyleth and cast it on her a dude in a hat well yeah she'll look like she's not herself do it i'll stay in the shadows with my arrow notched so my arrow will do much better than your dagger no it's fine shoot your arrow too shoot your dagger whatever tell us and we'll release you do you recognize her percy you gave her a fucking dagger and then it flashes back to you right (laughter) you are so fucking lucky it did that (laughter) how did you lose the hand what you say you're a scientist do you use magic then who cast seeming on you this is clarota all fucking over again oh god are we really letting her out she's got one hand how's that going to be useful he poops on things i snapped off a thing in there sorry about that you're going to use luck now sorry about that it never ends trinket watch her tell us what you need and we'll get it for you dear can you walk quietly please we did we already checked them all do we see anything in the room no but there is fighting can we hear fighting can't we look at what she's built after we fight them i creep over to one of the doors in the room and see if i can hear anything on the other side (groans) 14 can i see if the door handle is-- i step to the side and push it open and sure that could've been so bad 20 it was like whee-- oh nice i would loot but it's percival's home do we see anything that looks like it could be a doorway leading down or anything we're on the main level do you know percival how to go under i will wear it thank you oh no i guess there's fighting going on now i don't want to eat right now i saw fighting lots of fighting i feel like if we're going to move we need to do it quickly that was a good idea very smart there wait if i put the holy oil on things it lasts for a few hours right it lasts for half a day or something it dries and stuff what do you want what's in there i walk in with her don't be creepy grog (laughter) tell you what i'll hold onto that armor for the time being yeah you can take it off we'll put it in the bag of holding you can put it on after we're done are you planning on fighting with us helping us tell you what we'll take the weapons and give it to you if we need your help no i'm taking the weapon i don't care what does that mean oh well then give it to me careful that's made of glass darling ooh i get a piece of paper this is awesome yeah we were also running out of time there are people fighting right now when we defeat the briarwoods you can come back and explore this room to your heart's content an important question here percy are they keeping her or is she here of her own volition ziggurat what's it for is it underneath the sun tree he's probably with the briarwoods anna shut up percival anna and i notch an arrow and aim it right at her throat shut up brother run and check the study let's go towards the under-- lead the way down no talking we're heading down he's going to catch up well you've worn clarota's thing before don't i know we've been here before so we take off running towards him (softly) i don't think it's her it's not her could be a peasant just flip the little switch it's just you taliesin 11 yeah (laughing) she was trying to set us up in this trap you do understand that that's good what's going on (sing) arrows and bows fuck we've got to kill that motherfucker either way whoever it is just do it so i'm with anna trinket-- i tell him to hold onto her and drag her along with us so he clamps down on her arm 16 but i can keep running i can run all the way up 30 so i can shoot an arrow okay cool shit that's good he's unconscious no if nobody hits you-- okay so i saw him go down does it look like he's awake now to me i'm mean it was all happening very quickly i scream and i run towards him i slide down on my knees and slide across the room and try to cast healing word the minute-- or cast cure wounds the minute i get to him if i slide down and slide with inspiration that is-- wait hold on acrobatics oh that's good 17 okay so i'm going to cast that at 3rd level so that's 3d8 where are my d8s that was the worst roll nine that's okay because i slid to you yeah and trinket keeps dragging her right okay it's going to count even though it slipped out of my hand it's eight she ain't got no weapons all right he's going to bite her can he cannonball her as an attack of opportunity no not so much nine oh wait oh no i've got to roll for attack first huh that was not
