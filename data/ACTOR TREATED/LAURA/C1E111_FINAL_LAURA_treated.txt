are we allowed to say what we did in it oh nice i am in it i play the blade of galadriel i know get this so i'm an assassin elf right she's really cool the dlc is going to be about my character no it's the only one it's the coolest thing i don't think i ever told you this when i saw the character design she's a combo of vex and vax no seriously though she's an elf chick so she's an assassin she's got dual-wielding and she wears feathery armor it's so freaking cool so basically it's like if vax was a girl which is vex of course baby even at this very moment as i said it aftershocks was i supposed to say that ranger this feels so weird to say after you mentioned that happy stuff which by the way you're wearing your dalen's closet shirt matt and it matches your eyeballs so beautifully next time there are dalen's closet shirts in the store go check them out there's tank tops they're really cool they're cheaper because they are sleeveless that's less material dagger dagger dagger it's been re-released we have the scanlan tee we have all the tees and it's getting cooler now so the hoodie is still in the store the softest hoodie ever is there go check it out we have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards and other stuff and more stuff coming so keep your eyes peeled i want to watch it but i don't want to watch it it's so good did you already say about the physical copies too when those will be released give a high-five i've got to get my passport oh my god i'm doing that tomorrow i'm going to write a note in my calendar no but seriously if you want to feel free i'm writing an email to myself yeah we did we saw him no because you did a good job of killing that we should keep moving upwards i'm assuming well yeah but percy the belt i think we maybe should do that actually but he was doing something he was reading or something all right wait we have light yeah see pike's mace is lit up we said that last time probably your hands are less noticeable than pike's mace so maybe we'll not have the mace on that sounded just like her did you want this acid-resistant armor you'd at least be resistant to acid yeah trinket is out brother make sure you stay within 60 feet of me you said you're 20 fucking feet in front of me i'm using my fucking earring to whisper to you stay within fucking 60 feet of me all right and the tunnel's rising steadily upwards do you want me to fly up there of course can you not use your wings well then hop on you don't know that do we have pass without a trace on should i cast that on us no wait i shouldn't because i got a proficiency so we're both stealthy stealth we're fine so we're just going to go i'm not casting it but here's the thing everybody stay right at the bottom we're going to fly up but we're not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them and then come back down all right as long as everybody's within 60 feet of me because we're getting really close and i don't want vecna to see us i've got this ring ooh that's good 30 30 what do you see well get a fucking closer look yes but quiet is the key word i'm going to hover do we see any other openings 20 do i see any other-- maybe we need to do this quickly this doesn't seem like the most stable sort of tunnel hop on the broom darling in tempo grog can we pass under his legs or something rage quietly at the same time acrobatics 22 but you do extra damage because you're-- yes what do you see we sneak under his legs again to like see what's going on oh should we be on the broom no you should be off the broom because you might check for traps i'll check for traps along the wall and ceiling and he's going to check for traps-- both of us or just him with advantage investigation natural fucking 20 we should go toward the cave in don't you think does this seem like there's any traps that could be set off as we walk towards the-- i'll look at the sconces i'll look at them better you guys there's no traps we should head towards this darkened room i follow up and stand next to him did you want to go in feel free i think i was more stealthy than you a moment ago so are you sure you want to be in front of me and the brazier is complete dark it's cold this is not good maybe the mirror is a door should we try to walk through it hi darling i don't know why he didn't hear you you used to be so good at that is the mirror leaning or is it on the wall can i reach down and touch the iron on the ground the floor does it feel warm go see if you can walk through the mirror we've done that before and we all exploded no what is it (groans) simon go through the mirror no nobody's in the room he's the only one in the room what if we all have to push every button at the same time no nobody's in the room no coming up from behind us can't you call to him when you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist how about that unseen servant what about the brazier is it cold does it look like it's hot there's no other room it's a mirror oh keyleth that's our reflection what do your gnomish eyes see scanlan what is the symbol of you should go in there see if you can disengage the trap can you do that i want to go look at where the symbol is and see if it's a fucking button what did you do i fly up on my broom and do it to the symbol up on the corner and go (blowing) we already figured it out yeah to clear them out i'm in the corner above grog two lines shit i thought it was going to be another-- the one clean spot left on it ooh i'll go into the corner above percy there was a reflection there too right (blows) i looked straight at the camera as i did it it was really awkward is there one with three lines or are there any more areas we saw a reflection okay i'll blow above the door we all walk around going (raspberries) what if these are numbers and the order you have to push the buttons i know one two four pike goes over and she helps you if you lift me up i could see the ones above the door oh yeah we know that's the amount of times you have to push the button wait i think we reversed it i think me and travis got it right i hope we passed the test did we get it right (victorious laughter) we'll copy it and you can see what the fuck is correct no this is wrong i'm just going to draw it (counting) okay so now we know the order to push the buttons and the amount of times to push the buttons we step just outside the door again and let his invisible servant push buttons yeah but the buttons are on this side the buttons are on the side of the mirror so we could shoot arrows at them okay let's hit buttons let's do it let's get through this room the reflection of that so the upper left corner from where we're looking we'll know if we push it again then we did it the wrong order in the corner bottom corner upper right-hand corner let's go in hey we did it guys sam and is there any traps so he rolled way better than me because i rolled a ten do we hear anything are you looking for traps as you go brother do you want me to fly up and get some we have to go up right does it look like there's openings in the ceiling does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from 23 no that's what i was about to look for too keep your voice down well he's not going to be able to do that right now because i've got a fucking ring did i see any stairs i'm going to cast pass without a fucking trace it's my last pass without a trace but i'm afraid-- what if we bring out an entire fucking city of undead dwarves upon us oh my god vax is going in with you i want to kiss percy before he goes don't die in this stupid temple right on scanlan sorry percy girls are going to look for stairs the boys are going in the stupid temple fuck my fucking ring we can't split the party he was really excited about it oh my god he was so excited about it we're stealthed we're pass without a traced she pass without a traced us 39 natural 20 for pike oh wait she gets disadvantage so much good for one shitty-- we don't know that he rolled shittily do they look like they saw us towards that pulsing light we don't want to make too much noise i'm going to shoot a couple there's only eight of them we can take eight undead i take two of them by surprise that's auto-crit yeah they're super-silent arrows so it's auto-crit well great that's great 20 okay oh the other one super-duper hits it's a 19 plus 14 i'll see how the first arrow hits 14 oh i didn't hunter's mark whatever 14 15 16 two lightning damage do i add anything sneak attack how do we d&d plus ten sneak attack i hit another one 14 plus four lightning damage and that is plus eight oh sorry i did sneak attack on the second arrow okay i did eight damage too much okay no i think we should save don't shoot percy pike can use her mace on anything left in that area is the glowy window within 60 feet yes we do she cast it you're like gladly what about pike because she just knelt down she didn't really fight my natural 20 for pike wasted 30 for pike 29 for me (whispering) do we still have the thing do we have it in the bag of holding what if we use it what if we use it and it just repels them can we see in one of the windows 34 yeah but making any kind of noise would draw large crowds but first don't tell him to come right out tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they follow the light there might be that crystal looks really appetizing and i want it it looks really super magical me no the blue crystal is right here i don't know no you go get simon 2 to go get the crystal and then we all within 60 feet of each other fly up simon 2 i'll prime an arrow a handkerchief to put over the light he's holding a hanky they will be staring at us what if we destroy the crystal i wonder if all the undead would die let's keep going i'm going to get down and shoot just the ones following simon 25 no 33 24 i guess we have it bubble tight bubble we'll try to avoid the clusters were there other buildings like that ready to fall from the ceiling 18 (shushes) caw quietly are there any undead around us right now can we look at the gem for a second since there's no undead around yeah can you do an arcana check on it how big is it is it baseball-sized we can't see anything around us you should do that okay i'm going to gaze into it super hard so bright y'all i saw so many things you know who had that our good friend tary he was wonderful is it the same color as his knuckles i'm okay squishing it with the hammer i think it's funny that we spent so much time getting it and then we're going to destroy it let's get out of this dome is this investigation or perception 23 so you could open them up are they trapped i'll look to see if they're trapped i rolled an 18 all right then i'm going to try to jimmy open that lock i already said it two wait yeah that's straight-up strength not a saving throw two i'm really fucking weak you'd think i'd be stronger pulling the bowstring but no okay i put my legs up on the wall and (grunts) it's a trash chute we could fill the city with water drown all the zombies wow really it was meant to move i think i loosened it for you grog yeah open the door shit let's try the other one no let's try the other door first how big is the tunnel so we can fit in we brace ourselves on the wall to make sure we don't slide down pike yeah i want to be in the front keep going up the slide or take the stairs does that sound familiar to us at all natural 20 we were stealthed i'm aiming at the first one i saw has he seen the two coming down the stairway yet i'll attack the first so he can take the second these are auto-crits though because we are surprising them can i hunter's mark him oh so we don't have to roll for attack it's an auto-crit 27 second attack oh my god 20 20 on the second attack i got a one on both thank god they were both at advantage and they're all critical okay so the first one is a crit solid that's okay 14 plus six lightning damage oh wait you know what should i single out the lightning damage or say what all the damage is so it's 12 lightning damage okay don't do that i had already rolled that but it was a six again so 40 plus 12 lightning damage on the first i didn't do hunter's mark damage on that first guy add ten because of hunter's mark on the first one yes i was all on one unless he went down would i notice okay then the second one 21 on the second one can i shoot him again before he runs away sorry guys we did it i wonder if we should have let them talk for a second oh well no it's okay i've got advantage 23 okay i'm going to cast grasping vine around here so he can lash up and try to catch that wizard the cloaked guy that's running away he has to roll a dexterity save above 15 so it snatches his ankle backwards then i'm going to shoot him twice what is that 32 14 plus four lightning damage i don't get sneak attack on this guy though okay 14 plus four lightning damage and then i'm going to hit him again that is also a 32 no that's-- well it's very high 27 28 12 plus six lightning damage i am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here (singing) the space between it falls limp off of his body oh god oh my god roll so well do you get advantage oh the guy in red the guy in red is controlling it say it again good to know but the orb went through it that hits forever i have a dagger but i don't even have it drawn i have resistance to necrotic damage by the way okay no he's behind her wasted all of our 20s on goods it's a fucking wraith pike comes running up the steps sorry grog that gives everybody advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws and any time you're healed you regain the maximum number of hit points wisdom and death saving throws and full hit points when you get healed oh great well i've seen all the things explode fucking hell i'm going to pull out my vecna symbol that necklace that we still had and put it around my neck because that fucking sphere is out and i don't know if it matters do i still have control of the vine okay and it's on the other side of the force so i'm going to use it and i'm going to try to grab a hold of the guy-- the guy in gray is holding the force wall right but it probably is a concentration the guy in red is holding the sphere the guy in red is holding the sphere i'm going to try to knock him down and see if i can break his hold on the sphere maybe is that stupid that's a bonus action i still get an action and movement oh god i'm going to spread out i'm going to come over here maybe or here oh jeez i don't know i can't hit anybody i'm going to wait i'm going to hold my action until i see something getting through that fucking force wall so that i can attack him oh yeah stay within 60 feet oh my god what if we fail these rolls we're fucked what was i holding for i was holding until i could attack something or until i could get through the wall i think it was through the wall 23 pike definitely takes it with her mace of disruption she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage that's a 21 to hit 27 for pike is it a fiend or an undead so it has to have a wisdom save of 15 ooh that's good you did the six and the four radiant damage is the bomb i can only do this as a bonus action so that she can have that up right okay she's going to cast spiritual weapon should she do it at a second level okay she's going to cast spiritual weapon up near the wall as a giant sword that looks like it's on fire no near the wall yeah up close to the wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing is down and then she's going to hold her physical action until there's something that she can attack yeah her mace oh that's me i'm vex i'm going to dart away from this ball as fast as i can and i'm going to come up here i broke through the wall i can't reach i'm too fucking-- it's fine i got it and i'm going to hold my fucking attack until something comes out that i can attack wait i have bonus action still okay i'm going to use that grasping vine that i still have up and i'm going to re-grab onto that stupid guy's fucking neck and yank him towards the wall he's right in front of 15 my spell dc may be higher i don't know if i have increased that in a while so my spell dc is 17 i wanted it around his neck just to make him annoyed oh no he's coming back for scanlan oh my god we're going against gandalf right now you guys you can move five more feet you've got more movement punch him back toward us bigby's hand on the opposite side of him and punch him back toward us did we notice did we notice that the wall went down i'm going to shoot at the dude in red in front of me i'm going to sharpshooter him the guy right in front of me 22 to hit 21 damage on the first and then 19 on the second that's also sharpshooter no that's 19 to hit 27 on the second but he doesn't have control over it anymore this guy in red is down so all that's left is the guy and the wraiths we killed him that was the first guy we killed yeah that was your turn that's amazing pike gets to attack pike has been holding her action to attack as soon as she could too so 20 to hit on pike where is my other d8 here it is (counting) so it's 22 saving throw is 15 i know right kill him we can't do anything about that floating ball cover it with a handkerchief but stay within 60 feet everybody gather up around me again avoid the ball i'm going to rifle through the robes of red robe well we can grab their robes i don't know how many of those we have but i think we also have a necklace i'm going to take his robes yeah the guy in the red was controlling it it came out of the wall can we reach down and grab him away from it i use my grasping vine and i yank him away from it scanlan you're hideous now you got to roll higher than a 19 can you give yourself inspiration or dominate that shit i get ready with the vine to yank him away in case it starts moving toward him now inspire oh my god you did it what if we use the orb and go straight up we don't even keep tunneling we juat go straight up to the city yeah do you need us to heal you or anything what do you think do you want to go up so it forces them to speak the truth does it work on undead so you could cast it and then pike could cast speak with dead and it would come up into the zone of truth but they have to answer the questions right let's do it find out how close we are to vasselheim no but how close we are to vasselheim what's the plan of attack in vasselheim how big is his army we get five questions i think with speak with dead where is vecna within the city who's the death knight let's do it cast your zone yo (singing) autozone i don't think so casts speak with dead he had a different color yeah red robe oh no what did he do to pike and you said it was minus 36 damage pike got psychic damage from that dude 31 points of psychic damage look for shadow of war
