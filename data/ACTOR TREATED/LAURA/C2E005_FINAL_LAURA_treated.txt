blessing of the trickster just in case you want to stealth because you're squishy yo yes how far away are the ones on the roof how long is the distance from us six yeah well i'm exhausted can i invoke duplicity can i use my bonus action really fast to say a little pray to the traveler and i'm going to cast spiritual weapon i'm going to cast it right above this zombie gnoll it's going to be in the shape of a giant lollipop like a bludgeoning lollipop yes yeah okay 17 ooh seven seven radiant damage oh wait oh wait oh wait i was looking at the wrong spell hold on oh 1d8 plus three seven plus three-- ten that ear is mine and i'm going to send my duplicate after her yeah oh really initiative is an ability are attack rolls sam and okay did i already ask that thanks thanks sam can you lick this one i'm going to put it back over here i'm going to try it maybe it'll roll really well with your spit on it it's so pretty right seven liam and mm-hmm right there (sings) k-n-o-l-l oh no 20 a teeny gnoll oh no no he's like a grandmaster gnoll oh i feel like that's a zombie gnoll i pat him on the shoulder and say don't worry nobody saw that dashy-dash okie dokie i'm going to send my duplicate out against the wall on this house yeah against that wall she can go up to 30 feet and i'm going to run across-- yeah can i get against the wall further in yeah right there that's good oh yeah i'm going to use my bonus action-- as i'm running can i use my spiritual weapon and-- i think it's 30 feet let's see 20 feet you're right i'm sorry 20 feet towards the giant guy and hit him hit him with the rock 15 boo for my action can i still see my duplicate around the corner right there she is going to cast-- okay she is going to use the cantrip sacred flame against the same big guy yes basically yes that's what i did technically i did this before i moved good he has to beat 13 it hits him yes it does four well that's one method to be able to reach that's the grog one i like that you're facing the wall so it looks like-- i'm going to point out i've been doing it wrong because i was thinking of my duplicate as like trinket was which had movement the same as me and it is a bonus action to move my duplicate which i did not realize i'm going to stop doing that yeah i just looked it up and i'm sorry oh that's real me this makes my duplicate way less fun if i can't move her that's my spiritual weapon 120 feet yeah at least she's directing fire isn't she harder to hit because she's so little or you drop it because he's prone and molly will get super advantage on hitting him ooh she's so wanted (laughter) and a miss and a miss yeah right yay i'm going to run away from this guy that's next to me i'm going to run out into the alley so i can see people yeah can i use a reaction on that i'm going to say i am rubber and you are glue and use hellish rebuke on him in infernal okay maybe hold on i'm applying my changes to my health this is so much oh 2d10 okay nine ooh chilly i know and my bonus action so for my bonus action i'm going to send my lollipop towards the giant guy and try to hit him at the same time i'm going to cast-- what am i going to cast radiant-- no guiding bolt with you know i'm going to do a little flourish like pink energy comes out okay spell attack ooh that's good that's a 19 plus five okay yes yes yes you didn't touch these ones six eight nine radiant that's radiant damage and then the spiritual weapon-- oh good then the spiritual weapon will have advantage great oh good so that's 20 where's my eight six plus three is nine oh i'm going to use the rest of my movement to run over and try to get behind this wall that'll work i was going to go to the brick wall yeah sure why not you can do that ugh we got to get the cart that means we almost killed him that's what that means we almost had him yeah have we killed any of the gnolls-gnolls what about the guards aren't they going to attack this skeleton one that's right here next to both of us yes i had i did the hellish rebuke to it i am so surprised i fall off the wall okay are either of those two gnolls over there damaged okay well i'm going to use my giant lollipop and it's going to swing and hit a couple times and try to hit one like a bat okay this is the one you licked eight sam's spit not a good luck charm shit i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself and then i'm going to leap off the wall with great flourish and land next to caleb okay that's a good idea i'm going to land next to the guard then i'm going to skip away to the building what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning the same thing that happens to everything else kill him but at least it's not a critical attack whoa what did you do yeah but we didn't get to go because nott just jumped it basically i was going to have my duplicate go over and touch the guy laughing on the ground and cast inflict wounds natural 20 five six 13 26 yeah that's why it's more fun if i can move her that's all happening right now i run up and i'll cast cure wounds on molly then i'm going to run over and do the same thing at level two to nott that's six points of healing for you i'm sorry i'll run up and cast it on nott oh no nott i pull her up into my lap oh that's good 13-- oh 13 plus five no plus three of course i say as i cut off the ears of some of the gnolls these people have lost everything that's okay because we got two ears off of all the other ones i'm also going pull off a chunk of tail and see if it will pass did you notice they had some undead gnolls with them have you ever seen anything like that do they eat the bodies too much meat what are they feeding oh or that (gasps) wc i get up and i run and see if our horse is still there thanks man thumbs up to the family
