grog lovely trinket is out and he is walking between-- behind me and percy yeah we had really think about being there is that what we had to do maybe we have to let her know we're here oh shit is this a thing where you think you're invited to a party so you bring your whole crew and then maybe realize they weren't invited yeah get us on the list once you're in there then we'll join you in line i want to get on my broom and fly up in the air and see if i can see her from the air okay okay how you doing pike what and i turn around and the ocean is still where it was behind us pike i don't think you've gone far at all dear i think you're in the same place how did we do this before maybe we just have to think really hard about being at the tower i close my eyes and think really hard about being directly in front of the tower oh shit i open my eyes she got all the fucking way there what did you do pike that's what i fucking did open your eyes grog it's working for him i'm going to try to follow him i'm not going to aim for the tower i'm going to try to get to pike yeah how did you-- how did-- shit we should have followed pike i'm going to close my eyes and be like sarenrae i really believe in you you're so holy and very divine and beautiful and i think you do really good things for pike and i'm very happy about that fuck this is not working i'm up here dear like a train all right i'm not closing my eyes i'm just holding onto pike's hand nice good job pike (laughing) it's beautiful you know vecna he deals in secrets it's kind of his thing we do he's been working on it for a very long time what about the goddess ioun the goddess of knowledge would she have known vecna's been taking over her chapels temples recently completed a ritual in the shadowfell oh no how do we seal away a god the dawnfather he's not doing a lot of talking to us so it hasn't happened yet okay will he be as accepting as you you should throw a party invite them all get to know them again i'm going to send this to you ashley since sarenrae is still standing there i want to say to her-- shit shit sorry i want to apologize this feels so stupid i want to apologize for never realizing what you are and what this could be and for not showing you the reverence that you deserve and i hope to change that in the future and i will certainly think differently from here on out well i think you're pretty wonderful and i took these from your beach it doesn't seem right i just thought they were really pretty what even are titties terrible matt's like shady shit oh i thought but isn't that where the dawnfather is i understand now i fly up next to keyleth so i can see wow do you think this is like sarenrae where we can't get to him unless we have him in our heart i mean i've tried to talk to pelor before maybe i rush down and say don't eat the fruit i think it might be souls grog do not do not don't (gasps) yeah i'm going to check it hello are you a soul (gasps) oh my god it is a soul it just spoke to me oh my god what's your favourite color it said blue like my feather did you hear it it was talking grog it was talking not in the bag of holding keep it in your shirt pocket are we getting any closer to the citadel are there any people does it look like there's tracks in this orchard but they're picking the solid fruit yeah i guess i'll be in the front percy have you done a lot of talking to pelor yeah it's a long trek we've got a while just keep on pushing on right we don't have anything that'll make us move faster that seems stupid yeah it's beautiful i wonder if its apple grew as big as the actual tree if it fell you'd be doomed hey i think we're getting closer like should we put some sunblock on as we walk towards it do you think this tower is compensating for something or maybe it's a representation hard to tell that's good (laughs) i'm going to look at the citadel with my eyes wide open for five seconds and then close my eyes really fast to see if i can see better details of it like when you look at the sun hey i'm doing stuff here it's science this is beautiful worth it worth every second i like pelor i like him a lot should've worn sunglasses here you going to try talking to them maybe they're like oh yeah sun tree i remember him he got taken away as a seedling but he was really great how's he doing maybe they don't even speak our language it's possible maybe he was just pretending he didn't like you because he felt uncomfortable because he likes you so much like kash breathe in breathe out i hope they're friendly he's definitely not as solitary as sarenrae is he hunin and kyor that we rescued didn't just meet them we saved them hunin and kyor i even got their fucking names right we're vox machina we were sent here to speak to pelor by the goddess sarenrae yes she did to speak about a very big evil growing on the material plane oh no okay 22 she's good hear that grog you're not evil well it belongs to the great evil and so it's possible that we can use it to defeat him so if we don't have it we might not be able to do that could be really great okay i hold percy's hand as we're going in is the armor solid no just grog because he's an idiot no shadow underneath us this has to be heaven the doors just keep opening is the light coming from the tower didn't you do that just last week grog-- next time we visit the dawnfather wear some underwear this floor is like a mirror it was you that i was speaking to in whitestone i had no idea we have the eye of vecna no we still have it yeah he kept it with us please do you know what help it would be to us on the material plane maybe it'll make him weaker if it is destroyed he obviously put it in his scion we destroy it we keep someone else like delilah briarwood from coming into power right i say destroy it you know so much more than we do if you believe it is unsafe then we trust your wisdom in destroying it then i say destroy it i think that's a good thing yes we seek out the goddess ioun the goddess of knowledge the ritual of seeding was lost to time and we know that the goddess ioun is one of the only keepers of that knowledge how can we prove ourselves to you i don't want to challenge you keyleth keyleth let me i've never felt this before i kneel just me or the group of us well i've got the boots but i-- okay i'm going i take off sure i click my boots of haste before he does it oh my god does that ever end do you have to cancel it can everybody fly before i polymorph i toss you my broom you know that word can i cast frightful presence all of the creatures-- no of my choosing so all the bad-- not bad guys but you know people we're fighting oh really they don't even have to make a wisdom saving throw that makes sense do i
