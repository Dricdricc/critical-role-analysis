whoa no it's gone in sixty seconds ashley do you want this that's pretty sick (laughter) in a horror 630am yes this is exciting her face was ripped off but when her body was discovered she was wearing one of these how do you want to do this hoodies these sweatshirts that have been available before and then we took them away but guess what guys they're back for two weeks of preorder you can get these comfy cozy hoodies there's other things in the store too like our beautiful mug that i don't have on the table today that ashley used in blindspot you'll be wearing it all the time oh no we'll deal with him later (tearfully) grog can you pick him up percy do we sense him is orthax around can you sense evil how do we destroy him i will i guess so we drop it in acid again no how do we get him to whitestone somewhere with a tree we have the stone potentially i could try putting percy in the necklace and-- yes so we rest and then we go to whitestone in the morning i still bring trinket out of the necklace and i cast cure wounds on him nine whole points plus five animus can i read the names just rip everything out of my hands go for it have you seen her messing with that kynan do we have an arcane caster is that you scanlan we could bring the rakshasa through what do we know about these healing spells well what we need to do to percy how long do we have to get him to someone i don't either can we have taken a short rest to heal a bit before we do anything and i'm going to ride my broom there so i don't get any damage walking on the glass is it dark in there could i-- i set fire to the tip of an arrow and shoot it using oracle shot into the cave that was cool it's a fucking tunnel there's maybe something in there (tearfully) i don't know what we're doing i don't know what purpose it serves can i check for anything that looks out of place any danger or anything traps if you will terrible investigation11 it seems so safe sure 20 are there tracks at all in the cave i feel like they've already been in here and she took what she found following the path that we see her footsteps in anything that looks like a teleportation circle or anything (sighs) natural one okay this is what ripley took this is where she found the scroll (tearfully) let's go back super restful just the most restful sleep yes i'll fly over to them yeah but they might not understand what it means i'll fly over to them and tell them what they can go yeah but there wasn't a time limit on that i'll fly up to the airship we're going to find another way back home you can take the airship back to ank'harel if you want somewhere with clerics i don't know of course thank you oh shit i go back (laughter) oh my wallet no but i go back up and i say to captain damon are you willing to join a fight those dragons destroyed our home we could use an airship in the fight against them you wouldn't be fighting alone of course there's a lot of gold there a lot of riches i've been rolling so well tonight 20 (quietly) oh shit should i (sighs) do you know where whitestone is it's in the mountains i'm trusting you with that location thank you you as well we're getting married it's wonderful they're heading to whitestone we did it is didn't you ever have blanket forts grog we'll show you how it's done thank you you already said it you said it's mine it's mine i take one of the blankets

the best diamond i have i got a whole 40-pound bag of gems that's terrible scanlan yeah i've got a thousand-dollar diamond it's actually listed in my items a thousand-gold diamond is it orthax is there a way to find out what it is that's blocking it how do we draw him out we can pull orthax through the gate we need to destroy the gun can you reach out can you do that yeah what if we brought the gun in front of the circle it cancels out the magic of it or just bring in there i don't know we could try can i reach forward and look in percy's coat for that condensed whitestone that he carries sure 25 nothing else he says it's supposed to amplify magic right so i put it on his chest (shakily) i say percy i don't know if you can hear me but that day in syngorn was one of the best moments of my life and not because of what you think it wasn't because of my father or the title it was because of whitestone it was because of you you allowed me to be a part of the thing that you hold dearest and i was so proud but i don't want to be here if you're not whitestone still needs you darling i still need you here and i lean down and i kiss him and i say i should have told you it's yours natural 20 can you sing can you sing pike like you did for that little boy percy joined you then divine intervention (laughs) pike taliesin get your butt in here percy i feel like we need to take a break can we take our break i'm going to throw up good job ashley welcome back oh shit can you see are his glasses broken we did everything's fine dear who says we didn't a day is he gone what

don't know maybe he just didn't like what he wrote natural 20 i think it's fine keyleth i think he perhaps bared his heart a little too much maybe he said things he thought better of speaking of i did have captain damon bring his airship here is that stupid yes we should sleep you should you look very tired jetlag man it'll get you i don't know what to do how about some coffee then i give pike a huge hug why doesn't pike look at him now are you tapped pike he was traveling with ripley pike he was traveling with ripley oh no and percy's dead again my bad sorry because you are all powerful and you can do that oh no they were expensive oh pike seriously pike you're such a badass oh no pike i know right can i check out that letter that i found on percy's-- good night oh this oh well i suppose i'm a horrible person so you might as well be too this it's a letter it's a goodbye letter from percy to us i feel like it's a bit of an invasion i probably shouldn't have done that well i know i was searching for something important i just realized i still had it is all what do you guys think should i pretend i didn't read it should i pretend i didn't take it no it's just folded all right
