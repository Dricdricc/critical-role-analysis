you kash sorry why don't we ask you then vanessa i have a question do you ever hunt creatures just because they're evil and they're killing people what if lots of people are dying and you might be at risk as well okay okay so vasselheim is unaware of what's going on but a lot of cities have been destroyed multiple cities emon was the first one hit well it's still there technically just crumbled so much he escaped he'd been trapped in the fire plane and-- yes which is very strange red white green black blue was one of them at a time there's four of them there's four of them yes and we plan on it but we know that the slayer's take is full of very strong very qualified fighters and we were hoping to have you at our side as well a metallic dragon okay how do we talk to her yes no they don't isn't that like that rakshasa you were talking about well your help potentially the world is under attack is there anything that you know of that could help us defeat these ancient beings do you know of any one in particular that's convenient much hidden knowledge does he serve your same god or another all right one small question osysa i'm sorry you serve the goddess of knowledge of openness does that mean you would know anything of the god of secrets vecna i apologize very close to here actually would you know of a way to rid ourselves of his weapon of his tool right now what's east of westruun who has the map at least we should leave the temple she told us where he is and we have to find him i thought we were finding the stuff that's hidden while we're finding him i hate to thay this-- so these vestiges are ancient right spread across the land wasn't tiberius looking for a bunch of objects of magic that his people had sent him to find perhaps that's the reason draconia was hit maybe they were trying to hide these items vasselheim whitestone potentially syngorn even though it's hidden it's a lot to do how many is that grog by westruun we need to find kima we need to go to the temple of bahamut talk to people that are capable of helping us hey does the slayer's take have potions we can just have don't they have like a supply room oh good yes but we will be think about the giant amount of claws and teeth and eyeballs and leather wings and scales we're going to be so fucking rich oh how about 12 no i could have gotten something really badass if i had rolled better oh good two potions vanessa-- in quite a while-- grog you don't have any potions left who doesn't have any potions you get the greater one you get one and you get one thank you vanessa mm we're going to bring you so many scales you just wait wait oh wait one thing i know we're going is lyra around anywhere at the place where he is cool thank you i can read your fucking lips we're so nice

watch a fight don't hug him keyleth i run up behind grog are you guys all right then everything's fine all right i'm going to go grab a drink i walked out and they were making out mugging down in the alleyway i sit down next to the other side of kash in between him and keyleth how about keyleth not another drink how about you have some water dear your eyes are two different colors which is very interesting keyleth maybe you should go see what's happening go maybe you should go see what is going on with my brother maybe you should go find out what's happening with my brother he's stuck in a closet keyleth she's talking about you kissing kash wasn't he your first kiss isn't that so wonderful i'll give you a helpful hint if you're interested in someone make sure they know and if you're not then stop fucking dragging them along because it's not fair sure you're dragging kash along mmm is he really truly stuck in a closet right now (laughing) i go i walk away what are you doing stop it are we sober yet can we go find kima i might have heard what some people are going to be dressing up as and i'm very excited about it yeah i don't know should we go to the platinum sanctuary where kima is right oh should we wait until some people are more sober walking will help the platinum sanctuary yes lady kima what's the pattern look like we never got that stuff back yeah you can actually well we hope that you can as it concerns dragon matters we know that you serve bahamut the great the wonderful the very metallic these very terrible colored-- chromatic red green lots of different dragons they've attacked-- straight-up nemesis all of us or just-- 20 12 eugh so if it's not the nemesis the big nemesis then you guys could probably take out these dragons like no problem since they're not the big bads they're just really bad wow then i guess everybody in the world can just move here he's saying something what sort of aid can you offer then fuck yeah kima what sort of books fairy books cobalt reserve is gone the dragons took it out do you remember the description of any of the items from your stories we should probably have asked-- sorry one moment please maybe not all of the reserve was destroyed maybe they have secret rooms underground where they keep the most ancient texts we should at least check allura was on her way there isn't it very strange for dragons to pledge their allegiance to any other dragon then why are they serving the red one thordak he's ancient he was in the fire realm-- the fire plane and broke free and now he has other dragons serving him perhaps any flying carpets that you have lying around thank you for the vote of confidence yes unless you have any amulets or magical things lying around so no on the magic items of protection cool zahra kima emon's gone kima we should definitely go there we need to look at the cobalt reserve as well we need to meet up with allura though she was-- (sighs) that's a good question yes but that's in westruun not necessarily i mean yes it's fucked up that's down by westruun it is but there's trees and grog wants to talk to-- yeah so let's go to the earthbreaker off of his body ooh huzzah i say my lord are they talking at all or are they all super-quiet what's the test look at the coolness that's been created on this map so cool this is awesome matt hey you guys don't die he's really strong ohh yeah (laughs) that's almost as good as all those other things you did today are you still face-down in the sand oh man he gets four actions no he didn't do whatever you want i dunno you could've used your inspiration like pukey or like the other one oh man that's so embarrassing that's 28 times two yeah does that work on saves he's not shitting himself anymore you need to do that more that's pretty good oh no scanlan oh no he's so fucking cool (whispers) heal him no we should leave sorry we'll leave he did actually we should go kord groon or to the god that is-- hey come see us in portland come say hi it looks like the posters are gone but there's still some signed ones left if you want
