in the middle maybe just lay on the silt what oh you mean that little inflict wounds that i did oh yeah that lollipop's pretty freaking cool ooh can i have been outside looking at the (clicking) that we fought so i can look at him and see what's going on does its busted-up robe have pockets yeah that was what was it before i accidentally hit it okay oh four hey that's what he said it's actually a hole in the middle hey you know what though i bet that the seaweed is actually really happy because before it had those crab things and claws and stuff constantly fucking with it now we're really nice and it's calm and peaceful in here with this seaweed specifically oh he had a robe on not that i could see it seemed like a pretty old robe that didn't have any pockets or anything he did have really long tendril-y hair which was pretty cool did you want to bring the body inside or something so that whatever is out there won't see that we killed it but yasha's really strong okay no i'm okay right now thanks mom this is the body this is what i was talking about with the tendrils with the hair and stuff there's no pockets i already looked and stuff ew ew creepy i'll hold its hair if you want to hold its feet wait wait what if it's a door or something why would we let somebody know that we're coming if it's a doorway we could peek our head in down below i think it's just seaweed fjord did you want to climb through it i'll go touch it just in case oh it's nice it's nice seaweed thank you seaweed gross how i follow (stage whisper) this whole thing is a recessed sphere shape fjord will the key in the lock release the (clicking tongue) there were three in the art and there were three balls and you got the two balls he's holding two keys basically could you ask your god could you ask him well do it like i do to the traveler-- yeah hey traveler yeah he totally just said what's up hey traveler have you heard anything about this weirdo uk'otoa guy sam taliesin and he has heard about as much as we have (laughter) it's brownish i gave you some agate dice those little ones that i gave you those were green agate oh look coins what is that armor 11 (inaudible murmuring) how much money did we find i'm going to keep going i mean as long as everybody is hanging around talking i'm going to keep searching yeah i haven't opened it don't worry yeah magic armor what do you think killed him well i did say what you think killed him i got a 16 oh true i thought that maybe somebody sat on his hips like he was having sex or something but it was too much for him oh frumpkin you mean maybe you can cast haste on fjord and that way he can get away quickly if he needs to what if the chamber closes and you're stuck down here fjord well that's good that's a common signal i'm going to sit down really fast and say hey traveler i know that he's doing something for this other god guy but we both know this other god is pretty stupid so if you do me a favor and watch after fjord that would be really great because he's done a lot of things that has really helped out with stuff for you and he's going to be pretty helpful in helping me get to you later this year anyway i really like you and i really like him and i would like if you would help out please thank you can i help you did you hear what i was saying oh shit i thought i was whispering hold on let me think i'm listening what i

evil to me really any of us would be nice but-- okay (background music) that's if there's any left sam and he did it we need to get out go go go i'll push nott in front of me it's a natural one so it doesn't matter oh gosh can i cast control water is everybody around us yeah but we were just going through the door so we're getting sucked back towards the-- i'm going to cast control water and try

magic it's gone my control water was just to get us out so we need to i like it we've only got three cannons on the starboard side though if we turn to port side-- a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side-- we roll a 30 or lower it's good holy moly that was some serious stuff man are you guys okay (shouting) are you guys okay i throw a rope out to one of the survivors aw matt do you guys have magic are you going to attack us do any of you want a tattoo yeah i mean it's up to our captain we'll keep them tied up we have enough food caleb will you make sure that none of them are magic users as they come up on board okay it's okay we'll aim our fingers at them instead get up here why did you attack us oh that wasn't very smart (intensely) don't you know how bad-ass the balleater is the balleater it's the name of our ship the balleater we eat balls oh hey man it's like both of you are teeth people oh well all right did you have any treasure on there or anything well they tried to attack us bad things happen when you get-- we could give them really nice tattoos aw but one of them i wanted to give a tattoo to come on it's totally optional if they want to eat don't worry levar we're all friends here do you like tattoos this is really nice i've been working really hard on my skills where would you like yours no no no captain i have specific tattoos that i've been working on i want everyone who comes in contact with the balleater and captain tusktooth to walk away with his symbol it's a smiley face with a couple tusks and some googly eyes above it (laughter) where would you like it think about this think about how cool this will be think about in 20 years when captain tusktooth is the most dangerous guy you've ever heard of and there's stories about him you will be able to say i crossed paths with the crew of captain tusktooth and i lived oh so you can show people and be like hey check me out you know that hands are really hard because a lot of time the ink it spreads okay i'm going to do it oh oh a dexterity check 18 yeah yeah yeah (jokingly) i don't know maybe here's another one for you there may be some surprises maybe not why brokenbank can i send a message to my momma hey momma we are heading back to nicodranas is it safe do you think for us to get there because i know that stuff is happening and i haven't heard from you in a while probably because i haven't sent a message to-- my momma says everything's okay we just got to be careful between us or each no no no woo i think everybody gets 2 platinum we are in a completely different boat at least ship ship we can make ourselves look different than when we left (singing) looks like i'll be forging some more (speaking) i can do that yeah i remember how i did it too i think that's a good plan captain yeah did you release it or what where wait a coast with three cities that's the menagerie coast that's his mentor i could still send a message to the plank king and see if he answers did he talk to you do you think he can read your thoughts i mean if what he's telling you to do is go towards the coast that is what you're doing so maybe he still thinks you're on his side do you think the wildmother can hear your thoughts so if you think something dirty she knows what if you're thinking oh man i really got to poop what if you're thinking aww man i think i smell a little bit today i've got a booger in my nose what if you think oh does my breath smell bad no your breath smells fine but-- yeah you smell pretty good what did we get what did we get i didn't say you're stinky nott said you were stinky caleb i think you smell like salt and fresh air what is it oh fun lucky rocks are nice does it flicker is it like a hue light that's really bright it's like a pet rock but it brings you luck you should give that to fjord i go over to fjord and hug him around the waist and pick him up i'm just kidding with you well what else do you have i don't want to claim that if there's better things will it turn into a tree in your pocket i'm in studded leather armor yeah go for it plus you don't have a disguise self yeah you should take it you should take it let me see it whoa holy shit yeah she should have it because that will affect her attacks right yes yes yes i know what all these kind of ship documents look like i already forged some and also i'm around ships and stuff you

the mote yeah okay i'm going to look at the mote of possibility okay so i'm rolling intelligence at advantage because caleb's helping me i'm going to reroll again with my mote that's so much better than the two and the four that i rolled originally 19 plus one is 20 plus proficiency is three so 23 plus i think i'm proficient with forgery kit oh i understand whose name should the ship be under should it be tusktooth or should it be somebody that's not a pirate-y name yeah a new sort of name do they know any of your names in nicodranas i mean it could be anybody caleb you could look pretty officious we would be giving the ship to orly is orly your first name or your last name what's your last name orly skiffback right i really want a tattoo from him at some point we haven't done it well we just need crushed gems in order to make them so you could maybe crush some jewels orly how hard is it to make a cool tattoo that's pretty the shiny ones yeah yeah like 2200 we don't have that kind of jewels okay okay okay okay thanks orly i'm going to try to spend the time on the deck teaching sprinkle how to fetch an item like if i show sprinkle a button and hide it somewhere i want sprinkle
