you asshole the flowers are a little more bitter right now are none of us wearing the new shirt wow keep going matt only small medium and 4xl are sold out right now everything else is still in there the blushing tankard is that where we were going it was a tavern rissa there's a big party happening now wha-- should we-- should we party why no it's cool (gasping) i was going to write dick i didn't i like this town because why oh lead the way fjord that means that her sleight of hand is better than your perception that's all it means beau get me some too beau get me some too oh no i'm get-- (grunting) is that for me beau its beautiful wait i guess it'd have to be like this it's beautiful i think that's smart would i have seen fireworks before in nicodranas let's go inside you think it's safe i don't think it's safe hey nott have you ever been dancing before yeah okay just making sure i figure we're going to dance tonight (gasps) we probably should we should probably get kiri involved come on kiri this place is great i want to go try to play the piano yes i've played it a little bit at home i have a lot of really good songs that i learned when i was growing up i'm going to sit down and try to play chopsticks oh yeah it's an eight matt and (poorly playing chopsticks) did you say she was a dwarf i want to start playing the entertainer (speedily playing the entertainer) this is a really good piano you should be really proud it's yours do you have a tip jar i really think the first couple tips should be to me because i really set up the room for you fabulous did you see i run over and give caleb a kiss on the cheek thank you caleb i love that you did it where did yasha go there are four rooms so molly can have a room all to his own if he really wants to you know (clicking) (whistle) is it allowed in other bars i use my tail to-- i was going to smack him on the ass with my tail at the same time i'll do the other one it's sad really no stay play with us longer wait so your dad is what rich or something it's nothing to be ashamed of it's okay if he is what kind of stuff does he make can we meet him okay yes of course work that's what we're doing oh yes i was really hoping you would have houses of mushrooms do you have any no i just thought hupperdook sounded like a mushroom sort of town i'm going to stop though i toss a silver i think we can do it we can have her stand on one shoulder each-- i'll be on my knees then we can do these things kiri can have a ribbon and she'll do this while we do it it's basically the same as what they just did every night we should probably do that for this i would make an exception how much how much do people usually contribute are you a big drinker rissa we can't put her to bed because she'll just come out of the room won't you kiri because there's so much noise and stuff yes you are very sweet she would come out of the room i know her i don't think that's a bad idea what did she say what did she say that's it why do we need three people to watch kiri kiri are you cool with staying with yasha for the whole night do you promise you won't try to leave her and you won't try to come out and find us i don't think it is either kiri oh i just love her so much you be good oh that's right now me and caleb will do it you stand on our shoulders you wave the ribbon have you ever danced caleb (gasps) you have i can't picture you dancing but caleb we want to dance with you we'll figure it out you're very dexterous and i think you'll be a very good dancer plus you have already lots of scarves on you so you can do a lot of the things the people were doing yeah so should we dance in the street you know here's the thing he's already been with the ruby of the sea so probably nothing you do could compare to that kind of sad really i know as soon as i said it it was really creepy but you know what it was just a power play and it didn't really work out yeah but people that have slept with my mom are really rich and really powerful usually so it's a compliment for them yeah i could sit in the room and let you know if they're any good or not oh that's pretty good have you ever paid for anybody before why did you give them money though i want to look for flowers too then well you should show me sometime because i want to see it we can do it when nobody's watching okay i'm really good at the waltz yeah they taught me the same time i learned piano so many lots of skills i can paint i'm really good at baking scones specifically scones with cinnamon i know it's a very tough recipe but i'm good at it yes the third thing is something that i want to talk to fjord about because if he's that inexperienced then maybe he should take some lessons or something that's true no it really was more of a learning sort of thing yes it's all about studying i'll go put my nose next to his nose on the glass what are we looking for are there any silk flowers i was looking for those yay shut up 15 i hop over next to her (gasps) i've been looking everywhere for you mm-hmm you have the best flowers i've ever seen and i would like to buy some how much is a flower a copper apiece i will buy-- i will buy ten flowers from you how old are you you are five that's wonderful does your dad take good care of you are you a good dad i think that-- i don't know i wasn't counting 13 i'll buy 13 i give her two silvers you know i happen to have a little girl with me who is very cool and i think she would like to play with you mm-hmm she's extra special though so you'd have to be very nice to her (gasps) really where do you live because i could bring her over and you could play together tomorrow red brick on the base by door i'll come see you guys tomorrow my name is jester what's your name tara so nice to meet you red brick by the door okay see you does he seem like a nice dad ooh that's good 22 do you want many of them because i just bought a bunch flowers flower flower when you're performing you have to have specific moves yeah like choreography that's what we're talking about here i think that will work out well make sure you use your scarves though i have that i hit a random person with the wand of smiles as we walk by them that guy knows ah i don't remember 20 gold oh come on i don't even know if i want to do that for 20 gold well i've never been drunk but maybe i'm really good at it you don't know i guess it will be me i'm taking my five gold back from him and i'm stomping upstairs oh but i can work distraction i stomp back down the stairs and i join them is it tara i give her a little money i give her a silver no wait add your constitution 12 i hop up on the table next to her and start yelling beau beau i use thaumaturgy to make it sound like other people are chanting with me that's a 21 won't happen that's a good idea directly in front of valkin we start-- (laughter) 19 i want to cast mirror image on myself in front of her what's her name tanya and wiggle to make it look like her vision's starting to double oh no that's bad yeah that was the goal eight whoa-oa-oa wait we can win money from this thing i thought we only got tokens or something for free drinks aw no fuck it let's just do it without that deal double or nothing go nott yeah all my mirror images are like yeah drink you've got it nott are you under disguise self woo what no you got this nott i'm going to cast bless i think it gives you advantage on saving throws is this a saving throw but i cast it on you you guys look like shit there are yes is there money involved here i take five because i gave molly five we do have an extra room do you guys need to go to bed or something you sound pretty normal actually nott i'm going to ask caleb to waltz with me astrid oh well you know caleb-- caleb do you need to go to sleep no no no i grab his jacket you are not going to go pass out in the street you told me to be in charge of this i walk him upstairs and makes sure he gets in bed yes i am and you are very nice and a little stinky i'm sure astrid loves you very much i tuck him in she tried to shave her sober i'm doing ribbon dances in the bedroom what your money is gone is my money still on me i still have my money what happened to yours you should really spread it out beau that's really not good should we go looking for it maybe you dropped it under the bed can i start looking around the room 16 i think somebody might have taken it from you oh no i wonder if that's a common thing when people get drunk like that irena hey i knock on the doors really loud check your coin purses (groaning) what about caleb does caleb have his money what about your diamond me why would i steal your money that is really dumb so it had to be somebody that seems inconspicuous walking around the room and stealing people's money kiri i think she'd be noticeable downstairs taking people's money i might be able to help us also there was this little girl who seemed really sweet but she was walking around inconspicuously throughout the room and maybe she did it maybe we should ask irena if it happens often when these things go on oh yes i have a spell that can locate objects well i could locate potentially a money purse it's on this wand yes it was only the five who got stupid drunk we should find out if blemmy's crew also got stolen from do we remember if blemmy's crew hung around the tavern afterwards okay i still have money it has to be within a thousand feet and it only lasts for ten minutes a thousand which is not that far what if i cast zone of truth on irena but how will we know if she's telling the truth she seems shady as fuck yeah i don't like her at all i think fjord should do it the affected creature is aware of the spell always we go looking for irena i think she did it rissa did it travis and we should get them at the same table and ask them questions because they have to be within 15 feet of me oh good point with my money i'll buy you guys breakfast (singing) irena irena did you see anybody taking all of our money last night does it happen all the time when people do this drinking game wait what did you guys do with our cart would you have woken up in your drunken stupor yeah we go look at the cart is it still there and protected should've left our money in the cart i'm going back in the tavern irena what about the little girl there's a little girl that was walking around last night that was asking for money and stuff she doesn't steal things i'm going to cast zone of truth charisma 15 what are you talking about oh i don't think you need to do that i'm just you know curious about what happened last night if you have ever seen any shady figures in here do you know of anyone who would've stolen coins from people did you steal the money i'm just checking do you know who stole our money hey rissa come here for a second was anyone friendly with you guys rissa come here snip his-- no seriously though what was this why is this having sex stop it rissa do you know of anyone who steals money from drunk people did you see anyone taking our friends' money last night ooh good call man do we have any other questions to ask who are you all attracted to do you guys like me yeah because you were standing next to me anyway who are you attracted to do you like me are we friends do you really like me and stuff really yeah then you know (gasps) yeah because it probably blends in are they the same sort of shape as regular coins that's smart should i cast it she's telling the truth well maybe if i cast locate object we'll find out he was really talented though i mean like super duper weimar yeah we'll go and i'll cast locate object and maybe we'll just pass by something pocket bacon before we leave i ask irena who's still in the zone of truth are you really interested in fjord or are you just flirting with him because it makes you some money and stuff oh okay thank you i cast locate object on the coins it lasts for ten minutes what if it's in the tavern still i feel like we'll walk faster than the cart will go let's walk quickly aw probably not within a thousand feet cleff or cliff your shop is beautiful do you have any little toys that kiri would like kiri is right here she's a little girl she's very talented do you like it how much is that three gold pieces i think that's worth it kiri okay three gold pieces (distorted) whoa i don't know it sounded like a cow or like a manatee was at the table i don't know whoa how much is it whoa that is a lot of gold did it kill people we could destroy it and then you could give us the crossbow we're really strong all of our money was stolen all of their money was stolen i was sober thank you it was a choice you know everybody else was like let's get drunk and i was like that is really bad and i should probably stay sober yeah he was just talking about us you're still drunk aren't you vampires zombies i don't think so okay okay okay steelbringer's forge they're only a couple blocks away should i try casting it again yeah and the fact that you know him is really cool too anyway i use thaumaturgy to make it sound like whispers of infernal all around them oh hi they might have been party to a crime we don't know we're investigators at all you know where ol' blemmy is from whoa oh no you guys you guys they're going to get fired i do oh god guys thank you the little girl that was asking for money why you're right that's true we did do that i saw her but i did not ask her name i gave her silver i don't but i do draw dicks on a lot of my money but i don't think i did it to those well i have really good paint you know yeah that was a lot of money that too no wait because they didn't steal my money i have a whole pouch full of money you guys right here big pouch (singing to tune of silver bells) silver falls dr seuss meets-- you said the waterfall goes up a thousand feet and the apartments don't go as high as that so if i got in the middle of the area and cast locate object it would do a really big radius it would reach at least the top of the buildings okay should i cast locate object while we're walking around yeah i mean if i use up all my spells today as like this kind of thing i can the drinking coins right cast spell (gasps) ah i turn around and start running towards it it was duncan valkin was the guy that fought caleb okay let's go should we just go in i'm going to stay in the front (whispers) should we all go in at the same time oh you can't hear me we're not messaging together (whispers) i'm just talking to myself he's at the back door we're going in you took the money it was the little girl didn't i say it right away i said it right away hey i know you i saw you right i gave you some money you stole from our friends not cool i totally thought you were just doing the went down the chimney we're not going to hurt you just give it all back gail was it the traveler we can teach them the dances that

gentleman insight check sorry do i think he's lying no they're not they're super true and come back they don't even have to be that scrappy now okay what are we doing all right maybe we can negotiate our way into the prison and say we'll take care of the automaton and while we're in there we can sneak around and set the parents free as long as we give him some notice i think it will be okay ooh good point they got a lot of gold on them i did pocket some of the breakfast from this morning yeah question what are we going to do with kiri right now if we're going down into the jail or with these fabulous kids right now no yasha needs to come with us we need her help or kiri can stay here with these wonderful children (gasps) do you want to stay with them oh my gosh children oh schusters do
