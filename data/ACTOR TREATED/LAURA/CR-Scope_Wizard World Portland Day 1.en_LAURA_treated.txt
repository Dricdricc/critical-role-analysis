what's up how are you guys doing and trinket you forgot to introduce trinket join us (speaker feedback) warn us if you're not up to date which is going to be hard audience that's a good question (laughter) it's all right i understand he was so proud of that fact and it has not come into play at all but he thinks they're fine i like it that's where it started that very first game though you were something else our very first game that we played nobody really knew how to play except for matt and taliesin and liam had played some but we all were floundering we had no idea so they brought taliesin as the ringer so if we got into trouble he could be like i got you covered we're going to die no way nice i wanted to be a rogue but liam had already taken rogue and i wanted to be a half-elf but liam had already taken half-elf then i realized that liam and i actually in real life share a birthday and so i'm like what if we were actually twins in the game he loved it and we went with it i was debating between a ranger and a druid actually i didn't even know for sure which one i wanted i just emailed matt and i was like i want a pet what class can i have a pet with and he said either a druid or a ranger so i went with ranger so i could have trinket (cheering) i just started multiclassing into rogue though because i figure it's been long enough i can start learning the stealthy moves from my brother had you created gilmore before we ran into gilmore we just love him so much you have little boy arms oh that's right i have to say this is the best thing because travis legitimately did not know that that's what he did it wasn't a character choice he just didn't know no not at all it's gonna be so bad i just love-- no wait not everybody's caught up kashaw showing up in the last episode made me so happy as a person so good and so angry as vex it was wonderful i'm kind of going for it now as vex though i'm kind of going for it he's pretty wonderful he's pretty wonderful oh right because it's all over to the side it's sliding audience (laughing) that's amazing i'm seeing behind the screen right now and it's kind of weird to know that that's what you're doing to us (laughter) we do wait so those are-- wait wait do i get extra experience when i haggle because you never write that in the email that i get extra experience for that nothing travis texts him all the time tpk yeah (clapping) we have no more t-shirts titansgrave yeah thanks (laughter) travis and yeah titansgrave was really fun kurtis wiebe the writer and co-creator of rat queens-- (cheering) (muffled) did you write it he kicked his head off that's bullshit that's not okay stealing a role from somebody else audience oh man i mean ellie-- she's not here but ellie from the last of us that's an amazing character but the thing is i can say ellie-- hey (applause) i can say ellie from the last of us but she wouldn't be that character she wouldn't be that amazing if ashley hadn't played her hey i like that you're officially the little mermaid congratulations no i've had some ale audience thank you so much it's crazy it's so amazing that you guys have done so much and that critmas is the most amazing thing and the gifts that you guys send are so wonderful but the fact that you guys are donating to other people and doing good in the name of this community is so freaking amazing yes (cheering) audience don't you shake your head you mother-- i saw some of you shaking your damn head i heard a boo how dare you he has saved-- he has done some serious-- he did save you didn't he wait okay but you know how many times has trinket killed anybody audience he bit a vampire's freaking head off three killings no that would be so sad trinket only has 60 hit points you guys so that's why i don't send him in he's only got 60 hit points so if he dies then he dies and i don't know what i would do i don't know what i love is when we were fighting the dragon at our keep and he got frozen this was out of character i'm looking at travis going you'd better fucking save-- i feel like that was the one time grog really acted out of character when he saved trinket if i could take the spell polymorph if i could have that fucking spell i would be so happy i hate that anytime i want to bring trinket and we're stealthing or something like that and i'm like marisha-- --can you use one of your spells that you have a limited amount of to polymorph my bear you motherfucker you could do it yes oh man in high school i was doing this play and this guy that i had the biggest crush on ever was sitting in the front row i had one of those hoop skirts on and i sat down on the couch and i wasn't used to them the hoop went up over my head and it was like a dress rehearsal so i didn't have the full costume on so it was just like underwear so it was just like hoop and panties and i was mortified (to inaudible audience member) no he was never my boyfriend i am sure i also did a production of joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat and i was playing the narrator and i was running out on stage i did i ate shit as i was running out leading the entire chorus out to do this big dance number for go go go joseph and my foot caught in my skirt i just planted it on the stage and slid and then had to get up and finish the dance out oh but it didn't could have been worse nice audience we probably-- yeah we have done some pretty terrible things we've done some terrible things too i feel like vax is a really good person vax is probably outside of pike-- yeah because he really is in it to-- oh really has he done some shit i feel like i'm speaking for liam now i can't speak for liam but based on conversations that we've had ah we're all going to die aww look at this guy i get sometimes people online saying i've done something that's really terrible but for vex the motivation makes sense it makes sense the reason she would do certain things and it's not bad in her eyes it's not keyleth is the worst of all of us heart of ice you guys we're seriously going to be so not functional if we spell your name wrong later-- i always feel slightly guilty any time we have a shopping excursion-- audience exactly and not only because it's probably boring for the other players but i feel like it's really boring for you guys to watch us go buy potions and we also have a panel tomorrow not here in room c-123 you've been awesome
