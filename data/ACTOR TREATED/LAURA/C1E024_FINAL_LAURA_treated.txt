them and we're not ready to show our faces will you be able to contain yourself scanlan has it less purple my passive perception is 21 i give him the evil eye you're not there oh yes he can he's actually the guy we go to we can do things how long of a ride is it to kraghammer solo style if you're fast and back but you don't have to stick to the road as an eagle what do you think is it stupid to go and ride hard and try to get there and back before-- we don't all have to go a couple of us can make a fast ride or should we wait i really want the money no because some people need to do some work we need to send some people off hopefully be back in time our illustrious god just told us it's better to stick to the road because there's bad things-- yeah that would slow it down a lot but that's still a two days' flight-- oh okay she might have some we'll leave you alone percy to work do you not have an earpiece we can bring-- oh we're not there i don't know i guess so actually i'm staying at the keep good going keyleth i like it mm-hm i'm not there i walk into the room to see tiberius throwing things out of the bag of holding i'm assuming but there were artifacts that they

the money you owed us for completing the mission you sent us on oh it was 30000 gold plus all the extras for the scalps that we acquired oh it was that is so weird i remember 30 mind flayers a

that help yes do not shave his fucking beard off why are you so evil i like it as we're standing watching that trinket comes rolling into the courtyard oh why didn't i get more points in that natural 20 should we call it the roly-poly or the cannonball i think i like cannonball because it's better to shout during the battle oh we have some formal dresses already tiberius could you prestidigitate this thing and make it look like an actual thing you're fine that's what it was you're immune you're definitely immune to water now good job his toga he's wearing a toga made out of a tapestry i go in and put my arm through percy's arm to make it seem like we're twins i go in with percy to make it look like we're the twinsies of course oh yes percy wasn't feeling very well he ended up staying home 11 i pat vax's hand-- percy's hand what the fuck this is creepy vaxy yes he's stealthing it was the briarwoods do you have any of your people learning about the briarwoods are they magic users in any way have you heard anything do any of you know as somebody practiced in the arcane arts are you good at seeing through illusions or-- anybody that is you know very skilled so she wouldn't automatically know they wouldn't be able to spot immediately that percy is not actually-- great so wonderful to see you i give her a hug we catch any of their eye at all can i keep an eye on them as they're walking to their room just as long as i can see their mouths moving i can read their lips do i have to perceive it i have a feat that i can read it yeah i have observant read lips meaning i can read lips from any language i can understand yeah i want to check out this too 23 i can sense you you dick can we get a feel for where the briarwoods are going to sit are there place cards
