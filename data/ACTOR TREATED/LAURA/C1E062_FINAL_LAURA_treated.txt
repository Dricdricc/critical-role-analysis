this is amazing what should we sit straight-up prep oh jeez your own fault grog vax is just strange oh my god it's definitely not something we can wade across i'm assuming it's a big river can i perception and see if there are any sort of creatures that are visible i can brother do you want to scout up ahead maybe fly up above the river and see down into the oily land both of us yes i can and i do i pick my broom up i float above him on the broom you are so hidden right now i can barely even see you so hidden oh okay i fly up and i stay above him i don't want to land on the ground you wasted your entire hour of flying for that (laughter and applause) oh i got a vax sigh i like it a what check oh i got a natural one (laughter) no and i crawl over and grab it i swing around and hit him with the broom disadvantage aw come on that was so much better than the first one 13 i hate you sometimes all right i get on my broom and fly after him like a loser yay we're back can i float down and try to grab him a wisdom saving throw shit balls mother-- that's bad nine can we try to get out can we try to get out of the water help right here are we underwater or are we on top of the water we're just dying oh that's good that's way better constitution ugh oh jesus six why am i rolling so bad right now can i cast grasping vine from the side of the river and try to catch myself i don't know i don't have my card because we're traveling i'm scared of all my dice no that's good 19 that's my broom that i'm holding up in my hand right now i don't know where's my brother where's vax oh no (laughter) was it a one can i send the vine to him she did a ten-sider that's good that's better me and vax are on one side and everyone else is on the other then actually i'm going to use my earring so i don't have to shout i feel like when i was crossing the river i wanted to kill myself and i'm afraid that anybody else crossing the river-- i think i have it i thought grog had it but i think i might have picked it up after there's so many rivers is it are we hey garmelie hi have you heard any stories about how people crossed these damn rivers before i know so tell me what you've heard cool did he make it how far did he get scanlan you're such a dick is that a natural 20 put it away keyleth put it away for the rest of the night put it in its dice jail oh five feet we could jump across them do you have tree stride i thought we could all use it always how no this is really good this is good because with the immovable rod-- and then tie maybe the endless rope to it and then you teleport back to the other side i don't know trinket is safe in this necklace right now wait did i hear right that these rivers are alive what did i hear you're going to chop down a tree grog keyleth picked a flower and the entire world ended oh why didn't i think of that i have the eternal string and i have the rod don't do it grog do not do it yet i'm going to start tying the rope to an arrow all right are you going to teleport and then we're going to try to do that so you teleport first i'll shoot the arrow see if i can actually get it to stick over there and then you can do the all right i shoot an arrow not directly at him but pretty close to him i have a really long-- i'm just going to shoot a couple arrows just to be sure 17 a five i hold the other side of the rope and hook it to the immovable rod there you can't use it anymore you're not allowed to use that dice anymore oh for strength checks i rolled percy what did you roll for strength we are so weak yeah we should each tie the rope to all of us grog you're on the end there with the rope no grog around all of us yeah so keyleth too you get a rope as well you get a rope you get a rope oh okay sure and vax of course obviously my brother who is standing right here very stealthily you know like you do it's grog then percy keyleth oh right because we've got to pick him up on the way through we're on our way to you garmelie don't worry everybody holding on to the rope athletics are we in any kind of favored terrain right now okay cool 11 there with the dice and the adding tie yourself on there garmelie (grunts) get up and out up and out how come we never noticed the battle map has a river on it oh no 28 oh no wait where are we i don't see us at all i think he was between me and vax my initiative is really bad as well go keyleth 14 yeah he's got roots yo no don't do it you do not touch that dice anymore yeah kill him grog kill him that would've been a smart move garmelie is standing next to him too we're all attached to him though me oh good it misses me okay i am going to send trinket out and attack it with bestial fury trinket attack the thing can i use my dagger that's on me to try to cut the rope that is attached to my front okay well i'll attack with trinket and i'll pull my dagger out okay that's good wow i never attack with him how about that 26 it does so does he do the bite attack or does he do the claw attack okay so now he's rolling for claws okay so that's a 25 for the second one okay oh jesus i'm so stupid okay that's eight yeah and then for the next one he gets two claws and he's going to use his fours jeez louise five plus seven is 13 no 12 that's good and then i cast hunter's mark can i try to fly up in the air it won't do anything i'm stuck on the ground no so i'll stay where i am i guess i'll continue to be flung around come on brother i don't know oh garmelie sing a song garmelie charm him do something how many d6s i have two more here we go then it wasn't

the way here didn't you we made it keep moving wait before he goes i want to give him a kiss on his head as i was kissing him can i give him a little pat down to make sure he didn't steal anything (laughter and applause) 23 well now i feel wrong saying i reach for it and try to see what it is yeah i take it back thank you so much you're so kind oh on him can i cast hunter's mark on him really quick can i cast hunter's mark on him sorry i should've done it when i was kissing him but i was distracted by feeling him up oh in the mansion thank god i cast pass without trace on us so that we can be stealthy she doesn't have mist form not until we rest i have land's stride does that mean that this doesn't affect me or am i still slowed down land's stride isn't on any of my pieces of paper oh wait here it is moving through non-magical difficult terrain costs you no movement then i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to pull out my broom and i'm going to let the gnomes ride on it since you guys will sink down a little bit more than the rest of us do you want to ride on the broom you sit on it and then you fly i'll say it for you oh really sit on it that's sweet (hacking spit) say (hacking spit) ashley and so at least you guys and me aren't slowed down so that's good can we see him we're not in the forest anymore this is bog 20 so he's checking us out so he's going to be able to get across all these rivers he's pretty cool he can jump really far yes but stealthily i cast pass without trace on us so we all got plus ten did you get something good 32 can i keep an eye out for any movement ahead of us or around us 29 does it look like the tree we're looking for 80 yards fuck i'm so scared of everything here and it's a tree with a glowing bottom what the fuck why if he goes unconscious he does automatically come back but no that's only within 100 feet that's not 80 yards no i'm not slowed down so you know what i'm going to sneak behind trinket i'll send trinket out and i'll sneak 100 feet behind him i'm sorry buddy okay don't get too far ahead of me we're going to sneak ahead and check out this glowy tree see it yeah all right sneaky-sneaky that's mean what do i add yeah okay six he gets no pluses no he's a bear in armor no six i tell him to stop i call him back i feel like that's animals that's not the tree we're looking for come back in so it's a tree that looks like there's people living in it it's a window looking out that's definitely a fairy tree i'm going to stay clear i'm going to go back i'm going to go back to the party and tell them what i see trinket died you're a dick i'm joking i think it's fairies i think we should probably stay clear it looked like there were things living in the tree it doesn't look like the cancerous tree how about no diplomacy from you maybe scanlan should go talk to them no oh wait you're taking the broom (laughter) i do not like this plan at all can i go on the broom with you scanlan if you fucking get my broom lost because you told me not to go i'm going to murder you and this is not in character this is me telling you that so we should call them back what did you see anything useful should we call the gnomes back i don't want to fight anymore before we get to whatever it is that we're getting to don't do it don't do it come back don't even fly close to the tree i have really bad feelings about this fucking shit mother bitch please fly fucking back right now please how far away is it i go (surprised shriek) (relieved noises) (cheering) what do you mean what thank you matt for saving a
