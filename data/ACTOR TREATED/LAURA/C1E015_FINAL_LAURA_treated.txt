another third spell slot 3rd-level spell and i figure you guys all have better spells than 3rd-level but i only have up to 3rd-level of my most powerful spell which is my 3rd-level and they usually do a lot of damage with the 3rd-level you got that ring of protection or you can have the beardy thing that's pretty high i think that's our wonderful matt mercer's call keyleth i think would like the ring you would look really good with a beard yes the only one who didn't is my brother the circlet with the hat oh sorry sorry i took that pearl and you wanted it huh yeah are we done are we ready to do things now yeah a super cute mouse this is true as well that doesn't add to and it looks wonderful on you are we standing out on the street divvying up random items well i've got a beautiful pearl

it i didn't even think you were in there oh okay without taking too long on it i was also hoping while we're in town that armor that we stole from the big rhinoceros monster in the duergar castle yes the armor that we took from him is there any way i can find a blacksmith that can maybe upgrade trinket's armor with that okay all right here we go pick wisely i'm using the new fancy one so don't fail me 20 does she have a beard (clears throat) karin yes don't mean to interrupt you look very busy here all right i've heard rumor that you are a very talented blacksmith i have quite an interesting proposition for you i may have some material you've never worked with i don't know would you mind stepping outside for a moment get some fresh air believe me you'll want to see this you'll want to see this ugh i don't know which-- that's the problem with having too many i'm rolling my trinket die since it applies to trinket that wasn't good nine yay oh no need for that darling trinket no no take a gander at his armor he's friendly don't worry yes he likes you i can tell yes it has i'm hoping to protect him a bit more however yes you can do better i'm sure actual combat beauty not my concern well (grunts) a very large one actually a bull-- bulette that one it wasn't on the surface we're a bit of adventurers if you want to know you've probably heard of us vox machina yeah that is correct nice right is two days enough yes understandable how much is a bit more and we will send many many customers your way of course (whispering) trinket isn't sponsored it's just fucking us how

wearing the belt that makes you extra persuasive was there also a grappling arrow percy ooh can you do that please be good oh percentile dice no a percentile dice 100 that's a 100 i think it is yes well should we go it's so he can spy on you did you get that potion so you can spy on pike when she's naked yeah yeah yes yes you have yes good i do oh that's so cute you really really want trinket to be a girl oh i see understandable boy and maybe he could roll into things now it'll be awesome trinket is a special bear he weighs a lot he weighs more than grog (gasps) fastball special trinket that puts him at 20 awesome so if i did try to roll him into something it wouldn't hurt him-- -- because that would technically be bludgeoning okay let's go see the council she looks really pretty today

level three yeah it just says a ranged weapon that is a really good question i'm going to run forward that looks about right yeah that means i can duck against one of those walls where the stairs is right okay cool so a regular attack 17 yes okay so regular attack and then also thorn attack right and three 23 plus my regular 14 yeah so that should get him and the rider on the hail of thorns part oh hunter's mark i said it three additional damage for hunter's mark on that oh shit awesome let's do it that is a 24 okay yes ten i love it oh i didn't move trinket at all i want him to be near me yeah but blocking on the wall yeah warn me first oh no as a reaction can we fricking tie ourselves down to the boat i do i have the rope of-- shit trinket or be free and be free oh i get it okay natural 20 that was the guard you could run to the side and tie yourself to-- and there's pegs to tie yourself to on the sides six hit points that's awesome where did the music go (laughs) there it was it happened in like second-second-second-second i don't think-- i remember you had to be damaged right that's amazing everything's falling oh no it's that jerk no fudge all right at me still oh

i'm not going to move-- i'm going to move against the railing around grog can i do that yeah and i'm going to stand next to grog and hope he overshadows me and i'm going to lightning arrow the griffon why do i feel like a griffon will be immune to lightning attack they're fine right that is 4d8 oh i have to roll to see if i hit okay which one looks like a lightning arrow this the amethyst looks like a lightning one okay that's good that's 25 okay so now it's 4d8 15 for my second attack i'm going to have trinket charge the elf girl in red or no he's going to attack the wyvern that's on the ground that makes more sense doesn't it and bash him with his new armor and you know do stuff (laughter) okay i don't know if i've ever attacked with trinket it's been a really long time and he rolled a one with inspiration-- no it's a one it's a frickin' one oh shit i forgot i was poisoned i forgot i was poisoned shit oh i'm going to finish the healing potion just for now would you mind healing him he's low on health look keyleth it's what you wanted you can rip off his whole wing rip all the griffon's feathers off oh yeah it's gone that's okay you still flung him real hard no you already

inspiration yeah okay so that's 23 yes i'm still holding the rope-- holding on that's my whole action right that's everything i can do okay yeah go npc next to a tiny rabbit swimming around and the
