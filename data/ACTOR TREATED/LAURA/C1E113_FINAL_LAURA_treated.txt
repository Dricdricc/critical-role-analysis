yeah we're going to put her in a locked room i was just showing this off before the stream we have this amazing matthew mercer shirt (cheering) so hey that's in the store that's in the store right now and it's subtle i like that anybody that doesn't know what it is would just think it's a cool silhouette shirt and then anybody that does know what it is it's like they're in he's smirking evilly it's an evil smirk that's what inspired us to do it because critters are awesome of all time why yes we leave tomorrow morning actually and we're also going to be in australia in a couple weeks or this november are you working on any kind of shows or anything so that we can do some spells that will be in effect for a day potentially so we should do some of our spells right before we go to sleep i don't know we do need to do heroes' feast i have one chalice left unless we leave him a plate then we need to do that right when he gets back yeah hopefully he'll be back before-- we'll wait a few hours to see if he shows up and then we'll cast it to see because we need time to be able to do it yes i'm going to start the heroes' feast i'm just going to get the chalice that's actually really smart wow that's really smart grog that took a lot out of you here you can cut me just do it we'll heal him up back of his knee are you trying to take him out of commission for future fights that's really terrible i want to cast cure wounds at third level on percy he smells he likes to put on a show oh that's smart okay okay that's interesting we didn't notice that before so sylas is back so my blessing from pelor hashtag blessed gives radiant damage to anything evil that attacks me with a spell that's pretty neat huh i have a feeling radiant damage is going to be really important in this fight what you've just been wearing it and it's not done anything you're speedy of course i could do it i have a broom after all but pike can fly now too she can fly ten minutes is a long time if it's right at the beginning of the fight it's pretty tight oh my god you can fucking fly so do you think you're stronger and you're more proficient with actual melee weapons right because i don't think i can shoot a trammel from my bow okay let's have pike hold the other one so pike you're the third and we have to protect our cleric fighting oh so we got to bloody him up and then-- we don't know if we try it with the trammel and it doesn't work it doesn't break the trammel we just have to try again oh wait who's holding the fragile one you're holding the fragile one can you still cast if you're a dragon or something there's coffee all over it this got put in the dishwasher and the leather got cooler after it got put in the dishwasher the thing is if you're flying you can get knocked off i've been there and then it's super bad so actually the pillars are really wonderful in that regard he could be off of the tower yes and then it's all ranged attacks that's what we have hopefully we'll be able to take out the briarwoods before the fight he was above us but if he goes off of the tower scanlan scanlan if you promise you won't run away i'll put this fucking hat back on and i bring out the stupid pointy hat that he gave me natural 20 and then j'mon sa ord will be able to help us help us that's good we go over the walls first here's the good thing about us bamfing to the feywild right they think we left and if we all actually stick together and don't fuck up with this fucking ring next time they won't know that we're there again because last time they had an idea because you guys you know almost died as we were going in he is how dare you if they dispel that won't he just turn into trinket and he'll fall trinket okay bud if you fuck this up scanlan oh i don't have any more spells do i to do it he can understand me i just can't understand him with my speak with animals shit okay oh it's 1st-level i have a 1st-level left okay here's the thing scanlan wants to turn you into something that flies good job yeah would you be willing to-- are you okay with that for the actual big-- i mean you could be up close and personal with fucking vecna yeah aw you can do it don't hurt him okay a wyvern yeah oh so you could use that tonight i think polymorph tomorrow and then use your 9th-level spell for something major because he can use a 9th-level spell tonight for something as we're doing this we're making the feast because we're about to get ready to go to bed right yeah so we make our feast before we go to sleep oh shit you can turn trinket into a dragon yeah right artagan can join us okay hey artagan can you look at this wand this wand in my hand it was a wooden wand from one of vecna's people that i hijacked oh do you have to attune okay great all right thanks as soon as we go to sleep and wake up oh good privacy oh i vote scanlan and he'll just hang around with us second scanlan hangs around with us until what yeah let's do that i'm sure they have truesight vecna's a god of course he can see everything oh shit so he's going to know even like he's going to know trinket's not a fucking-- is that seen on truesight oh no he's actually that animal so he'd have to know yeah exactly fuck it do it we are doing the pillars if he's not doing something on trinket scanlan do something so that we can sleep so you should've started that earlier i know what's done is done how do we know you're not the real scanlan shut up scanlans oh yeah other scanlan can wear things he's fully-- oh yeah put on that armor that i gave you put him in the armor i gave you that you don't wear acid resistance no i have cold now it was-- yeah that's what it was what about the wand of plus one for the spells it's a war wand oh god this could be it huh oh that's true you know what we're doing it for a good cause though saving the world no regrets i had a good run a few years before that but this is pretty great yeah it gives him strength (whispers) i know we need to though we can totally take this guy fuck it we're not going down yeah exactly fuck him we've got other gods on our side he's a fucking half-ass god that's right and you-- you're not going anywhere good night just barely trinket's back in the necklace for the bamfing over in the building now oh that's good 35 no you don't know you don't know i thought they could be trapped under the wall or something does it look like-- (pained noise) all of the damage no don't do it welcome to the game joe can we see does it look like he's got hands and eyes complete i throw out the rope of entanglement on the gloomstalker you're two people again how does it feel 24 the rope of entanglement is what i was going for i can't find my-- yeah does it look like anybody's noticed us 33 will this thing obey you we should get inside i let go of the rope and go back in the building so that we can hide i cast pass without a trace on all of us stealth check no she's got plate armor yeah you got your boots yeah so you don't roll at disadvantage anymore yeah you got non-clanky boots add ten to your roll oh shit are you going to let him do that to your girl oh god darn it i shoot an arrow into its eyeball 35 25 damage oh and i get to do it again 18 18 does that hit okay 18 how did you get here oh he's evil that's evil that's the evil dragon potentially oh yeah you should give us a speech how long does that last later then oh no no those are tens that is such a bummer it's okay the meal didn't do a lot apparently oh tight tight tight tight right before that only lasts for an hour here's the thing do we go for the outer walls to take out the shield first probably once we go in we're going in of thar amphala yes we don't have to take out the walls we have to break a couple of the crystals hey you remember our old plan of just set everything on fire let's set everything on fire we saw them when we were in the city before she knows so they don't necessarily know you're in the city okay all right cool okay stealthily let's try to make it to the outer wall so that we can cut out some of these crystals 30 does it look like there's an area that the pulses are brighter along the wall are we close to one of those pulses okay i see where one of the crystals is let's move towards that plus ten 29 i would have liked if he had signed it we got to get these shields down so that vasselheim can actually have-- marisha and how thick is the wall and we saw the crest before because there was a doorway in the outer wall is there any kind of doorway around us yeah how are you with doors can we see it like above the doorway it's like on the other side do you think it's possible to like punch up on the archway and knock the crystal down so happy about it try punching up is there a house nearby okay we can get ready to run there however we're staying within 60 feet of you while you're punching a double punch 30 feet away that's what i said i'm staying within 60 feet of you 19 hits a wall it's a magic wall 27 at least get in this building there was that encased part right we're going to stay within 60 feet of each other within 60 feet of us it's super important if you're within 30 feet of me you still get plus ten is it a boy or a girl gloomstalker oh no add ten 33 no 43 but we're within 60 feet of him right you said we weren't within 30 okay but you're still hidden from view from vecna (gasps) taliesin and but here's the thing we're not going to have a better chance to get them away from vecna should we attack them now we can attack them now away from vecna are they landed how far away is that oh my god and they're on this how did he know we would be here oh it's okay briarwoods down so we're in this building shit maybe he rolled really well on his dex save there's windows okay oh my god okay can i run upstairs and look in that window okay and trinket is out i bamf trinket out but he's down by grog this is so intense i can't believe we're fighting the fucking briarwoods again oh shit oh god oh god oh god in-game hour not this game hour oh shit 24 for me 24 24 you were looking me in the eye when you said it did you just fucking go father than 60 feet away from me just remember that because it's a thing during battle they could but we don't know we could kill them before he knows you are within 60 feet right now that doesn't give you a bonus it just keeps vecna from seeing you the only way we're going to get the drop on him is if he doesn't actually know we're here we're going to kill them i had a 24 can i lean out the window and attack okay i lean out the window and can i see delilah can i shoot at her with my sharpshooter she doesn't get any additional cover or anything okay so i'm going to sharpshooter delilah with one of my needle arrows that i've been hanging onto for a gajillion years so that is a 25 to hit yes okay good is that sneak attack because she didn't know i was there technically oh grog's standing right there (counting) 31 oh no 41 because i was sharpshootering and then that one definitely doesn't hit i know but it still was a roll it's 17 (scared noises) i'm going to use my bonus action to hide not that it matters but i'm going to roll for stealth that did nothing 21 nope 31 because i still haven't cast hunter's mark okay so it's grog vex delilah he's eight percy what she's disintegrating the wall oh no that's true you could turn the whole thing i'm like-- oh hello there i didn't see you ashley and man i really wish we had some tape right now did you get the attack use the gaff tape it's the best 31 on all of us that's good that's minus the five now it's dead did they take damage from falling that's an awesome-- is that your wyrmwood box oh oh well (laughter) yas queen tiamat kill that dragon that'd be like if i had to fight undead trinket no oh my god no do not get turned no he doesn't because he didn't have the feast can you see arkhan okay good what does this do again what does that do okay okay how do they get repaired is it like a doty situation how damaged is scanlan two already what are you doing do you know sylas and delilah are right there sylas is right here right next to sylas you want both of you to be right behind sylas do you want melee range or do you want back ten feet he can climb up walls because of sharpshooter that's a great way to roll it's fine you're talking about your disengage don't worry about it greataxe of the eclipse sylas do you want me to get the tape to try to land on the dragon feet stomping her chest 35 35 times two now what do you get for the crit on kas what do you get for the crit that's why i'm asking if you double your dice oh my god so 51 plus 3d10 no that's one hit i like it when the music stops we're like (hyperventilates) (gravelly) chop her hand off chop off her whole arm (singing) please die deliah we want you dead so do your damage again because that-- he wasn't doing his rage modifiers so you could add that then potentially i bet she's a fucking clone she made a clone of herself okay so if i attack her it's at disadvantage or with-- well then i'm going to attack her she's already restrained fuck it i'm going to attack her with a blazing bowstring yes 17 plus 14 with sharpshooter minus five oh god 15 plus two is 17 25 30 plus the blazing bowstring 37 that's everything right 47 for sharpshooter 47 i didn't hunter's mark it oh fuck i point my finger down at her as i'm about to shoot the arrow as it shoots i keep pointing at her like how's it feel bitch how's it feel oh i feel so bad for him i do have another attack and i attack him with blazing bowstring sharpshooter so 28 minus five hits 33 damage to him seven of which is fire damage i'm going to run down the stairs to the lower level yeah i'm in there two with one delilah's dead he deflects the bullet he's looking at me oh no no i ran away he can't see me i'm downstairs what does it do when he shrieks destroy him i like the magical flourish of the die out her eyeball and bigby's hand does that work on a bat can you trip a bat i need a food for my nervousness you could break your tooth like here guiding bolt up the butt you want to move forward so you can hit him 6d6 all radiant that is a really good roll he's really far away from us now can you do anything at 120 feet scanlan yeah you can't switch your initiative oh my god please please please he's used up his legendary resistances right advantage can you run 30 feet and then do something i mean as soon as sylas isn't there he's going to know we're here or we can all just run if we hold he just keeps moving-- whose turn is it just try to get sylas wait why didn't i get to go can i run out the door and hop on my broom and fly as far as i can-- yeah but i can only get 50 feet away from you guys if i come here-- so i can't leave so i'm at the bottom of the stairs if i run up the stairs and broom it from here how far would i get ten feet out the window and he's 150 and i'm-- my shot is what but with sharpshooter-- no that's different shit wait let me look at fenthras i'm just hoping there's something that says it's 300 feet (nervous laughter) okay then it's only 120-foot range right with a longbow oh yeah my max is 600 fucking feet okay then i'm going to walk up to the window and i'm going to try to cast bramble shot on him with advantage 20 oh my god okay so 12 that's 18 plus 4d8 43 and he has to make a strength save of dc 17 or be restrained and does he take bludgeoning damage from hitting the ground that was pretty awesome can i see him 34 misty cloud how did we fight him before sunlight destroyed him before sunbeam destroyed him before now he's in the gaseous form okay so i rolled a 34 he's 150 feet away he's 150 feet away from us so as a group we can all try to move forward but as we get closer to him-- what's the daylight casting distance can you run forward and get close enough hopefully we have to stay together i'm technically right here right now i'm on the second level next to pike no it's percy's turn you could technically try to sh-- oh yeah mist form (laughter) well you can get within 60 feet of me so just move toward-- does it take him a long time whatever that sparking thing was we book it towards the tower right at the break we're giving away-- i don't know if that's-- i feel like do we see any other doors like secret doors maybe can i do that without letting the rot behemoth see me we didn't really think about how we were getting up the tower did we maybe the rot behemoth moves can you tell her to talk sorry sorry that's a thing i placed my seed inside of her i make everything weird matt just chop the tree down it's a thin tree that's sick it's like she's got a built-in shield now now it looks like she's pregnant that's terrible (something clanks on the floor) do we fly up or do we go inside and up the tower i'm sure there's no traps or horrible things on the inside of it of course the little blue gem i love it i love it yeah we'll drag it out of the doorway so we can kill it pull it back and we'll have one of the-- i mean not that you're not strong and very-- pass without a trace is still fucking up if it's been less than an hour i got 18 plus ten can you have him climb up the side of the tower and meet you up top well we can try it though because you rolled a luck what that's fucking badass 37 we need that orb oh we can get out of the way and let him maybe run into the undead that are-- no okay yeah destroy undead i don't know how many undead we're going to face-- but he might have you know i don't know what kind of army he's going to have up top so it's up to you so maybe do one of them oh 18 you're at six proficiency bonus now you're not at-- so your dc is 19 sorry matt no don't do that to her did it do anything to the rot behemoth coming in should we kill this shit while we're stunned how do we know we're not going to run into a whole bunch more okay and then all these things are going to chase after us so we might as well kill them now while they're stunned pause for 30 minutes and heal beacon of hope just means it heals the max that a healing spell or a healing potion can do you don't automatically go to full health that's okay do you have a healing spell for people i don't think we have 30 minutes i don't know i mean they're fighting at vasselheim right now we all need healing i'm 40 points down no we don't have it anymore might as well take them can you try healing and see what it does what does that do you don't have beast shape so short rest short rest okay he might not be back full strength yet he takes a while to rest up it's going to take two hours to get up the tower we need to not rest i'm taking one well you can do the speech as we climb up the tower the speech does what does the speech regain hit points so as we climb the tower she could be saying it a greater healing potion is 4d4 yes i'm going to invoke my blessing of the dawnfather scanlan two can anybody cast some death wards too we're doing things yeah we're doing it so i'm invoking the blessing as we get closer the stairs are long but they're not infinite i feel so inspired keyleth thank you in addition to our plus two so now we have 21 oh god oh god oh god okay are we getting near the top okay here's the thing the people that have the trammels should probably have a death ward too okay you're good okay so that bumps you back up once you've gone down once so really he needs-- and you well no you won't come back right away the right no wait which hand does vecna chop off does this feel like it might be delilah's room her chamber is there any traps in this room what is that investigation 14 for me what if we go-- no the people that are small go around i'll bamf trinket out on one side put grog in go back put arkhan in go back we work our way around the runes the zombies are little they can work their way around are you guys okay with this plan oh fuck i thought we would be able to avoid it natural 20 can scanlan two dispel that shit everybody else went already you can spider climb to the ceiling good job guys nice we're fine i like it we should cast it now we should do all of our casting now i invoke the blessing of the dawnfather oh yeah she did it on scanlan whoa are you still you i bamf trinket out if you want to polymorph him okay we should go up we should keep going so you don't need to do that he's the only one that can finish the sealing right before we go out you mean when we get up to the top no they're death knights can you open up the floor underneath them it's stone could you open the floor and let them fall it's a thin staircase three people won't be able to attack at once so you and me go up sneak attack fall back and let somebody run in and take it out yeah we'll take the smaller ones get ready to fight once we take the two out we sneak up is it auto-crit if it's a sneak attack okay are they surprised okay 29 we're attacking the two smallest is it auto-crit oh that's good 30 on the first hit oh my god i rolled four sixes and a five 29 times two is what 58 plus eight so 64 66 that's the first attack 19 18 on the second i immediately move to the side so he can run through does he move why isn't he moving does he have a helmet on oh no were they our friends pull the helmet off arkhan pull the helmet off is it gilmore we killed the two-- no don't do it arkhan don't can we cast revivify on them who is it who are they for sure it's kaylie and cassandra that is so fucked up how did you get here is it really you can i roll an insight check and see if it's him 21 or you can fight with us we're 15 feet below vecna he's right above us we're going to fight him
