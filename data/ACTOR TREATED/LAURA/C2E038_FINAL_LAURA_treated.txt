leave anything on the ground did they leave anything did they drop anything 11 i take some teeth okay i have a spell that i took this morning that will cure poison but i don't have anything that protects from poison today do we have to keep whispering can we pretend we're still whispering but let's not actually whisper what if we're in the middle because we're so heal-y we should have somebody keeping an eye behind did you notice the snake people came up behind the lizard people avantika's in the front with you whatever (laughter) jamedi what if it was his dick that was the snake though probably caleb if you do the bubble thing can the insects come in the bubble can you make it okay then do it please this is where we're camping though yeah but remember that you can hear through the bubble remember still though okay so we can't talk bad about them though but do it like do you want to stay with us but do it like this yeah captain avantika and jamedi did you want to stay with us in the bubble it's stinky in there but if you want to it's whatever it's a little bubble it's like a tent basically mm-hmm great cool do you want company do you need anyone with you okay beau nott (whispering) keep an eye on them okay let me know what happens shut up i mean-- yeah just-- forget it let's go i'm watching his back can i help does that make it easier okay nope one i'm not very observant today okay i've got things on my mind like he's gone he's just gone in front of me oh no don't make that sound matthew but he's not poisoned what do we do oh no i don't know if we're very far i don't think we're very far away this is really cool though oh god it's so scary it's a leopard with snake heads i need a turkish delight before i die no stop look at all the powder falling off 13 okay so i can see that huh well that's good i thought he was like on top of you won't he get an attack of opportunity if you get poisoned i can un-poison you we're the stupidest okay okay okay nine so sleepy like hardcore oh my god yay he's like slumped i'm going to dream about the traveler i'm dreaming that me and the traveler are skipping over hills and picking flowers can she flank it did she rage don't you get advantage because of your cloak you could get a 20 he's getting vampiric touch that means he'll get to heal a little bit yeah totally how about yasha did yasha roll i dream-- oh i spit on you with that fjord gets it keep hitting me oh aw should have focused on the dagger did we win we can do the bubble here and have this wall take up some of the bubble space or we can be right next to this wall i'm going to do it to you too we'll move over to where our bubble was before how about that i was sleeping did you notice yeah he was holding his light up really bright and seeing if he could find any words and stuff i think they might notice some light it's okay we're learning things a good night of sleep will do you very well or snake legs or snake arms or snake dicks into the bubble i bring sprinkle out from inside my hood and make sure he was okay during that whole fight i give him some water and some little food i'm sorry buddy (kissing) caleb-- i whisper in his ear make it poop make it poop on her hat what are you talking about make it poop on her finger but you can hear things (gasps) oh no on the way-- because i got a pretty good amount of sleep during that fight-- can i ask caleb before he goes to sleep hey caleb could we stick things through the bubble okay just checking i'm not going to caleb well that was for caduceus don't worry about it okay of course i promise i'm going to stay in here good night 20 have you ever seen those cat things before yeah we're pretty loud sometimes have you thought at all about the traveler do you want a pamphlet (whispering) the traveler he's everywhere he's really great i'll give you a pamphlet i get it out and i walk it over to him here just read it over there's a lot of information in there it's really important he's here right now traveler if you're here you should show him you're here so that he will like you even more than he already does just give it a minute he has cast his blessing upon us how long have you been working for captain avantika do you like her a lot what were you doing before you were working for her what's the craziest thing you've ever done i'm from the menagerie coast actually so that far ever in my life oh shit i've seen some crazy shit this one time i saw a bug carrying a piece of bread that was like five times its size and he was carrying it up stairs like up and then he would turn and then it would go up and then he would turn me too (whispering) oh shit (whispering) if they stab through-- (whispering) i put my hand on fjord's leg shh (whispering) i poke beau is it getting light yet we should wake up everybody should wake up we should get out of here before they come back with more people there were i think-- i couldn't tell they were shadowy but i think they were like lizard men or snake men could you tell which ones the lizard men or the snake men we should get out of here even though the lizard men are obviously the weaker of the two caleb we should get up and get out of here should we make the brush look like we weren't sleeping on it and stuff you know so that they won't be able to like-- okay good great (laughter) i cast pass without a trace on all of us again whoa what does it say i'll be right back keep going yeah you rolled with advantage right i didn't 34 oh that's fucked up what do the obelisk eyes look like eight okay oh dang we were going to pass it around okay fjord stare at it look into its eyes look into its eyes should we try to-- sam and okay you haven't been around her as much when she tells you don't do something-- well usually don't do it-- but okay that's weird she's hiding that she's actually not okay oh no oh i'm sorry i was wrong she's just a bitch oh no beau you must have caught something from weird bugs oh you got malaria oh no beau i'm just not going to stand near you okay so it's got a lizard face not like a human face with a really long neck like the beetlejuice part where his head goes-- this city without being seen there's a big group of us can we make ourselves look like the snake people what's wrong with that hey you two can you make yourself look like snake people can you be invisible but still we move really stealthily i don't think she can do it like we think maybe we do separate into smaller groups and try to stealth it oh my god okay that's a really good point what if we don't make a distraction we make them look like prisoners we still try to be sneaky but then if we're caught then we have an excuse i think they will probably try to-- i think they might try to kill us and then eat us like that guy over there well you guys aren't as stealthy without being within 30 feet of me-- what if-- do any of the people we see walking around do any of them wear cloaks 14 but there are some people that look just like people i will use my disguise kit and try to make it look like they've got scales on them they will probably know the people in their own fucking village though let's be honest (makes blipping noises) disguise self eight okay that's way better 17 now that i'm seeing how good i did on beau i'm realizing how shitty caleb is but i'm not going to tell him okay okay oh this one's from sam you look amazing it's a really good color on you what do you mean she looks bad i think she looks really good caleb just because he's dead doesn't mean he's a bad guy yes of course i am he's pretty cool you feel okay now well now we just have to go walk around snake people and not be seen so that's fine but you can't hear what's on the other side when you're popping in and out can you oh yes you can that's right you can we should probably get pretty snaking on here in the middle you guys we should probably do it again (singing) pass pass pass pa-pass i give yasha the blessing of the trickster i would say let's text her but she's in another country so she probably wouldn't get it at least i look like a snake person because he's distracted the other one has no guys okay i follow your lead captain (hissing) because i rolled a shitty stealth that's why oh no (gasp) natural 20 just to be clear i always thought that a t intersection was an intersection like this matt travis and no no no i get it i just wanted to make sure okay ooh oh no yasha can't-- (hissing) i cast hold person sorry i already said it at 3rd-level yes we should tie them up and then go we're in the middle of the street let's go let's walk quickly i really should've charmed them instead of held them but let's go grab them grab them slit their throats is there anybody in there inside wrap them up okay tie them up as much as we can and then gag their mouths toss them in a corner 15 we're already tying him yeah but we were putting things into their mouths no wouldn't that still make noise cover him up oh shit charm person somebody do fucking something because he shook it off but wait maybe nobody heard maybe they all fought each other oh that's tight we run away i point at the manticore hey man i look like a snake person nine okay yeah i'll try to back away cool one oh i-- that was a very aggressive roll athletics or acrobatics acrobatics my dear lord fucking seven but he still rolled a natural two right no okay okay good ooh run away add ten yes oh hold person is a-- you're right sorry i didn't realize hold person was a concentration 12 he's even more unconscious now keep going let's just keep running 19 where are we supposed to go shut up nott that was very good that was really good get inside of it (mumbling) can you re-lock the door or something okay we'll just shut it and hope they don't notice that we came up here let's go hard to read whispers yes whoever i'm standing next to i grab their butt avantika avantika are you here oh good this is the bowl drinking party we were looking for it oof i was like where are we going to stick the rubies where do we stick their-- i don't know where to stick the rubies look at all these dice that fucked me
