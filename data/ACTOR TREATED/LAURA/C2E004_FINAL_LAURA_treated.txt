this is so stupid sponsor oh that's cool ooh the sponsees that's fancy you're actually doing something else on the internet they're out all the ones that got selected tonight are shades of pinks purples and blues and i think it's lovely that was so fast though what about our appearances coming up me and travis-- travis and i are going to be at emerald city comic con the first weekend in march we're on the last one so we're solid does anybody need any healing you need some oh that's too bad because i don't have any spells left should we do something with this body i don't know if it'll fit on the boat would it fit on the boat that we came out on the whole body yeah i got a bunch of rings see is toya waking up at all it's probably best not to wake her up while we're carrying this head around does he have hair what are we carrying him by all right let's carry him fjord i gave you the bag of skin don't forget you have that you have the bag of slimy skin where's frumpkin oh good oh no oh it looked like a one from this angle still pretty terrible travis and you were rolling bad on this the last game you need to stop rolling that one all right we told you we were having a party man i take off my cloak and i cover the head with it no not toya over the head i feel so bad maybe one more or two more i'll pull three out go charm him fjord you're very charming it wasn't trust us we like to be unsung heroes you know like superheroes with secret identities yeah that helps people but if everyone knows who we are it'll be much harder to fight all the crime we'll try really hard to not let you see us we'll pretend we don't know you she's a halfling don't boat drunk how are we going to get this giant head to the authorities oh i got an idea why don't you go get a wagon as soon as we get to shore and we'll help you load it onto the wagon and then you just take it on in yourself they could make a lot of soup well you know whatever you disappear quickly because if you get drawn into that investigation it would be bad oh what were the two guards that keep coming to the tavern we wrote their names down that's right sam and no he's going to go to the police and bring them to the head have you ever heard him say nergaliid did he teach you how to sing to affect people's minds sorry for what beau really it was only because kylre was trying to kill us and she was afraid that you were helping him that went well i think she apologized for exactly what she did how many people are around the dock right now you weren't here i'm just holding a bowling ball can i lob the head up over the side of the boat oh no eight all right i need help it's still covered don't worry she can't see what we're doing it's covered with my cloak by the way it's a little tiny cloak it's like a half cape so it's like-- it's going to squish you oh that's good gustav's in jail still some people are loyal who is not very stealthy here oh that's true you're sneaking back to the carnival i give you a nice little blessing that's not comforting caleb you can hold my hand i'm warm blooded nott you were too should i leave my cloak here over the head sir good sir guard man should i leave my cloak here or should i take it with me just make sure you bring it back home it's green okay we stealth away you just get advantage seven is our back to him still is it still dark out oh my god has anybody seen my shoe that i dropped earlier around here eight it's not a shoe i drop a ring wait did we take a short rest when we were on the boat we did it was a short rest on the boat okay i'm going to cast invoke duplicity behind the guard please please please natural 20 (cheering) oh god oh she doesn't make a sound does she i don't think she makes any noise but if she can cast through her then i can imagine she can make contact because she casts on touch well if she's behind one of the guards then two of the other guards can see her yeah my duplicate is going to jump up and down and start flailing her arms and then run down the alley around the building oh come on did you see that behind you that's my ring i dropped it out the window i like to wear them on my toes oh please don't really we just left the building because we wanted to go-- this is the stupidest thing it's actually true she wasn't with us oh that's just mean oh goddamn i keep doing this so i can make a jingling sound with my chains you know the only reason we were out of the inn is because we were looking for you caleb we didn't know where you went who is it oh no what are you going to do not to get too close fiend creatures specifically oh well technically it was caleb technically what brings you this far the nergaliid he's not here wait which one were you pointing at yes what is it no but you didn't roll a one he rolled a four god why are we rolling so bad you can't she's chained up where are you getting a drink at do you want company i thought you left oh hey you guys we're town heroes

it that was outside i'm so tired i mean he attacked us a lot of guards too he summoned imps he summoned imps yasha careful fjord we haven't been healed yet you know she could take you down do it arm wrestle to arm wrestle i don't either it was such a good carnival i liked it i mean i could use a really large tent like the biggest one i would take that off your hands i don't know i could open up a hotel or i could make a bunch of dresses or-- yeah yeah right it's really pretty fabric (gasps) a hot air balloon haven't you seen airships yeah yeah it just involves fire you guys we can figure this shit out i've seen airships okay i've seen them (gasps) that's what we should do let's not open it here though this town sucks aw we waited too long fjord and i are going to try and get him into the academy gustav wait here and i take off one of my rings this is an old family heirloom and i hope it can help you pay some of your debt well that's so weird that you and my family have the same looking ones you're welcome they're right here you can get a look at them i play dinosaur fights (whispers) he said forefathers what are you looking for molly you should make your way to the menagerie

been in on it and just got right away with it she's good do you guys want to travel with me and fjord um (chuckles) we should really get a map you guys i haven't spent a lot of time in this area and i don't really know where we're going i wonder if there's a place-- maybe at the general store they would have a map or do you have to go to a map maker we'll go looking for things tomorrow we can go shopping yeah nott don't you want to travel with us too yeah she just said she was (laughs) oh that was so close yeah oh (laughs) were they going to kill you that you'll ever see i'm very trustworthy so we go south well i mean we are vigilantes so it's best if we you know have our secrets (jingling) yeah life does need things to live (laughter) clamp space speaking of cloaks mine smells really bad i'm going to go try to find somewhere to wash it hey caleb you know what's upstairs (laughter) you're bloody now too in addition to being stinky (laughs) it's pretty and you can choose the wood oh yes

practicing oh sorry you came in really late are you allowed to talk about it tell us about it you are a hero did you pass i mean they made you a hero so obviously you did this is so great can they let us into the secret society too 15 i'm going to draw in my sketchbook a drawing of the devil toad head rolling along the ground like a bowling ball sam and well kind of i put the little bowling ball things on there and he's going to run into all of us in chains being knocked down like pins eight-- no 15 well i did get really good training so it's good that i know how to do shading i want to go try to buy a map yeah warm doo d-o-o all of us okay i'm going to ask yorda if there's a map maker in town i don't want to go back to the stockade ooh what strange book places can you draw me a map of how to get to those places yes you're right i guess we can try that place let's go on a trip we've been there before the general store doesn't like us very much oh wait that healer's kit is that the one you bought when we were together you spent way too much money on it because i changed the tag that was great now i have it cool all right let's go back there they don't like me but let's go back there they don't like you either marisha yeah but they like money let's go we are looking for pickles did you get any yet most general stores have pickles this is the only thing yeah you probably should i think you would do well if you sold pickles do you have maps for sale of the area does she leave the room don't put my hands in my pockets got it i start running around and just moving everything on the shelves again the same way as before yeah just like moving-- oh yes 18 plus five i mean that could work i suppose it's not what we need but if that's what you have that's what we can buy from you okay that sounds like a good price yeah yes i do and i have a pretty ribbon out of it what the fuck what camera oh my god you guys let's go all of these places okay we are definitely going to visit this place called hupperdook then we'll make our way up to nogvuror oh man this is awesome hey look look over here this is where i live mm-hmm damn this is amazing okay i'll leave it up here can i just look around and see if there's anything interesting to buy in here like-- i guess if i bought the painter's kit then it just stays and i don't run out of that but i'm good on paint sure thank you so much for this beautiful map you did a really good job drawing it wherever we go i'm going to bury my head in the map and walk behind everybody like a total tourist there's nowhere we can buy healing potions in this city let's try that sephora what's the purpose of that yeah my friends keep dying do you have any health potions how many do you have ooh that will last us probably like a day we're superheroes sure yes how much for four healing potions okay hold on i open up my pack and i pour out all my money i start counting it yasha you should take it with them right now it'll be fun i guess i'll scoop my money back into my pouch and leave no you don't smell bad what did you do you don't smell as bad they bought drugs if you guys go in there and you buy a health potion don't spend as much as he says because apparently he was lying yes and i show them the map that we just got we're heading that way can i take the ribbon that was wrapped around the map and tie it around one of my horns thank you we're heading north to-- i mean we can stop through alfield first and see if there's anything cool there or-- what city was it that the academy was in i mean the ultimate goal you guys is to get to hupperdook but-- that's an afterthought well we have to pass through felderwin and the felderwin village first oh is that the one you don't like okay then we'll go up through alfield and then zadash and then we'll cut across and go to hupperdook how long of a travel would it be to get to zadash from where we are now a horse let's go back to the inn and ask yorda if she knows if alfield is a big city of course really i love flowers did you get me any you don't know that you guys we are going to zadash is that what we're saying we're going to go to zadash i don't know i just need to know where we're going okay which is a lot farther zadash okay yeah we can sightsee i get along with everyone beau is it ornna will you hold this before we leave is there anywhere in town that there would be a courier service where i could send a message can i go find one i'm going to write a letter to my mother that says dear mom all of the money's gone i don't know what happened but i am very broke and i need more please help me i am going to zadash that's where you can send it just send it to the inn that is the biggest one and i'll find it there just address it to me your loving daughter jester please thank you i need help thank you this is really fucking-- she better send money because this is eating into it okay i'll give the five gold for that we'll send you a note on the way to zadash then maybe you can meet us there we skipped town without paying our inn fees we did pay on the way in i did pay for a few days when we got in i guess that is probably enough oh man this is fun so glad you were here
