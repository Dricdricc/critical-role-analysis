very many arcane objects potentially in fact lord thunderbrand sent us over here that's his name right sent us over here telling us to find his wares here and we've made a deal with him that if we

already went downstairs does that lead down probably well then let's take the elevator whatever let's go down take it back let's do it the two dwarves grab and begin to rotate the giant wheel as it does you here the winch and the chain begin to tighten as it does the platform shudders for a second begins to lower as it begins to lower you can feel the actual platform shake a little bit as the whole weight is placed on the chains i pet trinket calm him down are we down yet can we see out can i look for goblin tracks down here and follow those don't curse me what am i what is it that i add

tracks do we want to step into the room fully i'm gonna stealth i'm gonna stealth too 17 okay like so many half-elves vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence vex'ahlia and her twin brother vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief while vex kept to the woods she preferred the isolation always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot and through a series of fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear her own stolen trinket to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely also he is adorable and gives expert massages oh we just stealthed i rolled 17 you didn't you were already stealthed though (whispers) oh no (whispers) should we go check it out i have a passive perception of 21 oh no ugh what direction is it coming from i think you guys should hang back and we should stealth over and see how many it looks like we're dealing with trinket stays with the group trinket stay with grog but we can't see anything we can see in dim light what'd you turn into oh no oh no oh no definitely hit light now oh no (group groans) transform back i'm on the other side can i stealth against the other wall oh no (group groans) (imitates thudding) now we have two as two slam into the ground beside you dropping from the ceiling portion wait do you guys remember-- (matt growls and snarls) do they respond to vibration i forget can we remember with investigation or insight yeah but it's still big gunslinger's dodge oh no i'm so scared to roll oh good 24 that's right (whispers) they're both surrounding me even with my awesome things ugh come on grog hyah i am going to shoot the one okay so i gotta do my math that's 11 but i get a plus two from my ring that i'm wearing for saving throws
