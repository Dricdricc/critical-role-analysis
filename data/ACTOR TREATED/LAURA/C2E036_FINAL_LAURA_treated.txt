new york city that was great i wonder what i said yeah oh my gosh we have our first keyleth shirt it's in the store right now there's two styles we got our sleeves are bullshit shirt-- why don't we have it taliesin and we'll bring it out during the break it's really cool go check it out at crit role shopcritrolecom you know they've got one that's sleeveless that's a girl's and then one that's unisex that's not as sleeveless and those are pre-order so if you order them they're going to ship in two weeks so that means they're not sold out immediately so that's really great for people that want to actually get them we also have our deven rue maps by the way that keyfish-- this keyfish-- was designed by lauryn ipsum who's phenomenal and we know her from her work on the artbooks we have our mini yasha bust in the store right now we have the wildemount dice that are still in the store right now and there's other stuff like a bumper sticker that you can proclaim-- i keep talking about the bumper sticker that's right i do i really want to see the bumper sticker this is the uni-sexy one it's so uni-sexy (british accent) look i don't know if you can see it but it's a goldfish with little dice trailing behind and then there's a special little treat at the bottom that says it's fine we're gods i was on my way down right when i stuck an axe in the back of a guy's head i accidentally stuck an axe in the back of a guy's head i didn't mean to though i was aiming for his shoulder i can do that i don't know if i have it prepared though i do have it prepared he's not dead i'm out of spells is it like a puncture wound can i cast-- no no no i hold onto his ankles i know it's really terrible i'm sorry that i did this i hope you're okay i mean i can cast spare the dying but he's already not-- yeah dying i cast spare the dying well i think you know maybe deuce could do something about it yeah see if he'll come down here for a moment don't move the axe what if his brain starts leaking out don't do it that's so messed up he got an axe in his head yeah see oh hi bud thank you so we have this ship now but i just wanted to say hi welcome to the crew you know we're the mighty nein all your friends are gone right now but it's because you attacked us first really no see that's okay i understand following orders sam and hmm what were you guys doing that's it no i don't want to do that that was really sad that's so terrible yeah i think that seems like something we're going to do who do you work for he attacked us first you know oh really why i like it yes we did is there some stuff you didn't get to what was the message you were trying to get do you see it caleb do you see it do you think mending would help fix that or would it make the piece of paper come together mending okay if we drop you off are you going to change your name or something are you afraid avantika is going to come and kill you no you go you go next like the ball is it the ball docktow what's that is that what this is swavain islands why does it say y y y y because it's on the other side of the reef on the hunt for ancient relics only two will find out laura and that's the island that's where the island is then what's your name gallan i like your name have you heard of the traveler gallan have you heard of the traveler do you want maybe a brochure i could tell you about him you could spread his name wherever you go all right what does she look like you should be important yeah do you know how to sail what we should change the name like mysterious ball the mysterious ball the mistake does it i don't want to ride around in the shit you just draw it you don't live in it man you did a really good job with what you were told to do well okay i'm going to go upstairs he's not tied up i will take that it's okay temporarily if you jump overboard we'll jump after you and we'll bring you back congratulations yeah i don't feel doing that maybe you should just go upstairs hmm okay i'm just going to tie your hands while you're sleeping though okay all right poor guy what was his actual name sam and hi that guy who i stuck an ax in is actually still alive yeah caduceus saved his life and he's really nice he's a pretty nice fellow well caleb did technically yes she's very religious and is interested in relics maybe she just likes to collect things he said that they were mysterious and her whole crew had some sort of magic-y stuff imagine if you swallow another one how powerful would you become those are the arrows are the ping-pong points that you have to hit and then you get to the island that you-- he said it was bad he didn't make it sound like that's the one that-- avantika who knows really it could be avan-teek-a we'll try not to i really should sleep if we're going to do that though we should really figure it out i wonder if in the morning we can ask gallan about it maybe he knows one of those sound familiar well let me go downstairs and wake him up the mistake would we get there in two weeks because that's how much food we have and sea monsters and my mom and our puppy we should definitely talk about it that is a really good question stealing comes with a pretty hefty fine so does killing people i walk over to caduceus um hello i sit down cross-legged in front of him how are you it has hmm wow no i don't think i ever have had a plan what is your plan what was your mission like how do you sometimes hear things well a lot of times i think that maybe the traveler has left me and i think maybe things are going poorly and he doesn't like me anymore but sometimes he'll just show up after a while and tell me that i was on the right path all along and he just made it fun for me to find it again you're not afraid of death are you breathe the world is a lot bigger than your cemetery there are a lot of things for you to see and you have to break out of your comfort zone in order to find the path that you are looking for just keep doing that you can't smell dead people when you're on the ocean yeah yes do you want to make some food we have a lot downstairs two weeks' worth let's go that's good for scurvy that sounds so lovely should we go up for the meeting and then come back down oh sweet we'll bring up and give people food while we have our meeting spicy fruit it's spicy fruit super disguised port damali's all the way up at the top we could just stop at the next city up port zoon that is a lot of time though to get there are we seriously considering bringing the ship right back to nicodranas how much did you make when you were-- i guess i could maybe-- can i try to cast mending on the sail and see if it looks like the burn damage goes away maybe i can paint something on the sail so it looks like a different boat we don't ever mention ourselves we could just sleep before all this stuff happens because damn it probably has already spread can we just sleep i'm so tired can we go to sleep even if we're just sailing around they're going to see us they'll see us when it gets lighter i'm going to go sleep okay bye found a carpenter plus it was dark when we left and nobody saw the-- good thing we changed it to the mistake (singing) guess what i can do i can make things fjord can tell me what they look like to fjordie is it painted on or is it chipped on i can do that well we don't have to unfurl it okay i'll rewrite the name at least on the side of the ship yasha hold my ankles i'm holding paint yes i'm dipping because i'm hanging upside-down we should disguise ourselves i do of course yes of course i can yasha's going to stay on the ship should i draw up the deed should i be okay i'm doing that as we're going in and stuff i thought you said you had oh good question i speak infernal
