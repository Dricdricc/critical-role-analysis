that'd be great do we need to hide do we need to climb up to its little cave that it was in maybe and hide it had a cave didn't it come out of a cave when we saw it oh i thought it was a cave be here right now be present can i stealth and climb up and see if i can see a cavern a little cave yeah what do i add to that acrobatics athletics oh really that's not what it was i moved it oh no 12 i'm so

you rolled worse than me like skyrim trying to get-- nice we didn't even get up a little bit does my tracking tell me anything 17 17 on nature granite simple stone (all laugh) what tiberius you prepared a lot no no we need that we need that we need that tiberius he's actually got a lot of hit points really i understand that oh no we need you shit really tiberius really (groans) (groans) and then you pull it-- -- out of someone's ear whoa i keep a perception out to see anything what do you think i'm doing i'm scanning i'm thinking i'm wanting to see if i see any dragons do i see any dragons was the behir a dragony sort of thing there's a dragony something i don't know scanlan there's dragony things though i didn't poo i'm sensing with my mind what are you reading how did you even know that nothing you're good grog maybe a steak some salad shrimp cocktail (gasps) you are seriously what that's disgusting really gross both of you enough nothing that i can sense there's nothing that we're going to run across so we're not going to run into any dragons okay we're fine yeah (shocked noise) he rolled a natural 20 he's an expert on mountains we should definitely stay away from that maybe hide and make sure we're hidey-hidey i have pass without a trace and do we have invisibil--oh no you have-- maybe we'll stealth it no i don't want to bring any attention like what how'd that happen how did that frickin' happen you are magic can we see any kind of movement it's really far away or-- is it movable right let's try to climb up the other side and then see what we can see they like cold maybe get up at the top of it and then do this can we try to climb the other side yeah i don't wanna be down on the bottom i actually own climbing gear too does that help okay do we add anything because of the climbing gear or is it ah that's important i give you my climbing gear because i already get advantage how about that does that count no all right oh so you don't need that i got 15 whoa i feel-- (whispers) should i say how did trinket get up the cavern can trinket climb they're good climbers i'm sorry but it felt wrong to lie no but we could tie the rope around trinket's waist with an athletics check does he get an advantage because of mountains i'm just trying to be honest strength modifier he got a 15 too you got this buddy you got this sorry yes 19 no no no if something could've taken out giant giants what could it be that could've done that (sings) there are big tall terrible giants in the sky no but she's a bird recon it yeah ooh come on keyleth oh ooh ooh oh yeah yeah let's stealth i don't know i hope not you should use the dust of tracelessness grog just so our footsteps aren't seen stealth (gasps) what is that what is it what did you find what is it what is that ah what is this what is this can i tell what it is hey look at this i don't know keyleth do you know anything about magic-y stuff tiberius bamfed out what about you scanlan do you know anything about arcana okay thank you can we do that i'm going to think about it real hard i'm going to buy it a steak and i'm going to-- what is it what is it what is it should we get out should we leave just leave let's leave stealth it out stealthy out-ie (groans) no you're in the mountains you don't get advantage aw shit grog grog inside i cast pass without a trace yeah do it do it do it keyleth badass but it knocks them all down no no no we should get the eff out of here now stealth and out they know we're here now they know we're here that was a sentry oh yeah oh we're looking at the city i was pointing at you what the what so percy do you know of any secret passages to get actually into the castle i agree can we camp out and hide because it's daytime we should definitely attack during the day what stealth up high i like it could you turn yourself and fly ridiculous normal people i like it everyone get your own tree trinket can climb trees bears climb trees i'm casting pass without a trace how long does it last okay fine i guess i'll cast it tonight never mind why are you being a dick scanlan i'm not casting it yet what are we rolling 21 for me and what do i-- just nothing 19 for trinket and they're close to us now so i'll cast it on us now that they're closer maybe so should we add ten to all of our stealth rolls that had been or do we have to roll again shit balls you don't have to ten to whatever we roll not advantage mountains oh wait that's another that was worse than the first one that's great okay well you didn't say you were doing it 18 oh it's a chick oh no (gasps) they're zombie giants oh my god yeah keeping an ear out for the wolves and just chilling in a tree and also i'm restringing my new awesome bow with the blazing bowstring which by the way is a longbow of sky sentinel once per long rest i can use a storm arrow which means that the next arrow i fire splits into three arrows roll an attack for each of them they all get 1d6 extra for each one that hits it's amazing it's one time per long rest say what so is it lightning damage or is it-- it says lightning damage thunder wait our friends aren't back yet it's already night and they're not back looking snazzy vax it looks like you have a mullet keyleth question can you make it look like we're not here with your foliage shit you know the illusions can we camp up in the tree so nobody can come towards us ooh i'm using hide in plain sight to make me and trinket extra extra hidey i have the unending rope motherfucker sure why not that's where all the rope comes from that we ever use let's reinforce the spiderwebs oh yeah what's up don't you think they would know all the farmers around at this point they've been there for a long time why is it called the sun tree there's reasons maybe we need to battle them at the sun tree does it get a lot of sun that could help us because vampires hate the sun maybe that's why they're hanging bodies from it to taint it would she be able to hear us (gasps) bring it back i don't know bring up the god of the sun again i don't know don't tell us what we can and can't do scanlan i like it let's do it i think they're terrified and i don't want to let them know we're here for fear they'll turn us in in hopes of saving their own necks this is true it could help out let them know the god of the sun is on their side probably you and scanlan are on that i have a feeling you killed percy and bring it back to life then we get the fuck out no didn't you say that all around the sun tree nobody's there didn't you say nobody's around the sun tree we'll fly up and over you just did the same thing fly up and over land bring the tree back to life get out i feel like they know all the townspeople when he was invisible they probably saw you no you were invisible how long how long's a bit i don't want to enrich all of the-- if we go right when the sun goes up-- we just sneak in here's the thing i don't know if you want to get all the crops all fancy because it'll just feed the briarwoods maybe just do the tree area which will be like two hours maybe a witch do you think that works i like it they would recognize you wouldn't they percy i like it (gasps) teacher teacher yeah remember that that's awesome you could fly overhead with keyleth drop it like a bomb i like it i have a sweet potato right here scanlan how far of a travel is it down into the city so we can do that a little amount of time so if we're going to try stealth this shit in-- so that we can be near the tree to protect you get into the town around the sun tree are we living in there we've got food for days we've got food for days he has a plan we should stealth in yeah we try to get in we're going to cast pass without a trace on everybody oh natural 20 on stealth yeah plus we have a bear oh no there's still a bear could we cast illusion magic do we have it seeming to make grog and trinket look like commoners yeah do that yes no he'll just be a really drunk peasant no he'll look like a fucking donkey or he'll look like another commoner then he'll look like a fucking commoner he'll look like a commoner-- -- a weird commoner i'm not leaving a fucking bear on the outside of town where there's hounds around and there's fucking vampires and birds flying around fuck you there you go all right (laughs) so are you darling so are you (fake coughing) where are we coming up i have passive perception of 21 i'm always looking our farm burned down no no no oh we should avoid that shit let's go into the city keeping an eye out for you know buildings that look clustered and abandoned that we can hide in is there any other abandoned buildings around okay where's the castle is it on the top of the-- oh it's that thingy okay (sings) divine intervention if you if you do your nature-y spell from inside a building does it still do the same thing or do you have to be next to the tree while you're doing it okay let's keep moving okay we avoid the tree a little bit and just keep going straight yeah 19 no that's a-- yeah 19 (whispers) my god keep walking keep your head down and keep walking no they have like hideouts they don't have to be where the soil they came from is that was the first one matt and there wasn't a gnome cleric one there it was a kid yo yeah can i look out too i've been on the lookout for a building the whole time 30 feet can we sneak in the windows so it keeps chained yeah dust of tracelessness yeah then go talk to the tree keyleth is there a cellar here not yet not just yet yeah i think we can definitely use these for explosions if we need them can you go invisible and still talk to the tree can you talk to the tree if you're invisible yeah we're in the cellar that's why i went to the cellar but make it not obvious because it doesn't want to look like we covered the windows do it that's what she's going to do from the cellar i'm going with you to the tunnel yes do you want me to shoot the arrow for you can you talk to it from here keyleth yeah (kid's voice) gee wiz i wish i had some water too bad we don't have tiberius with us with his endless water fucking pitcher sure sure sure you can bring it back try it reach up in its junk i like it it's $1000 is that for each person or 1000 gold for the whole party how about you did three bowls are we eating in the cellar no no for how long an additional 2d12 overall hit points ah badass yay nice we have another bowl so the spell probably started around 11 right so we'll start the fight in the morning the next day man that's mean matt
