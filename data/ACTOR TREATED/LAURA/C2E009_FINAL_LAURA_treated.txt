now i will play with you i'm not very good so you can take so much money from me 17 you can finish your game though i'll just watch i applaud the younger guy what do you want to play nott do you want to play no unless you want to get some milk okay what is the buy-in what do you wish to play i do i love it this is the one i was telling you about yeah remember with the three cards yes yes yes yes yes i would watch that too are you watching this i would be watching this too because i'm kind of a-- 22 perception do we put two gold in or some silver okay you're not too little nott you're not okay no no no wait i'm going to try to use one of my own cards and try to replace one of the cards 19 i thought i was trying to cheat and replace one of my things do i get to choose what it is or do i roll again okay i rolled it it was shit okay i'm definitely raising two from your two i'm going to add in another three so five extra on the table okay the younger one i'll cover my ears so i don't know oh okay never mind hmm i'm going to sleight of hand and try and replace one of my cards oh god oh 16 what by who oh that's weird where did that come from i shouldn't wear such loose sleeves you guys that was really obvious wait cheating what are you talking about wait i thought that was part of the game is it not motherfuckers they took my money yes nott i won real good i only lost seven gold that was a lot of fun you guys that was a good trick with the messages no but it would have if i had succeeded in these-- gosh i really need to get tighter sleeves though molly you have to teach me how to do that better okay what (laughing) so bad (yells) ooh no probably not you know what else we should do did we get rooms yay are we roommates we should look for claudia sheed yeah let's ask about-- we could ask bryce from alfield yes i am we went up there i thought i was desanitizing him shitty people no i'm from-- you're from port damali i'm from nicodranas wait what where are these shrines that you are talking about ooh we were just there that sounds good too do the shrines usually have a lot of people in them all of those guys of course we knew about those guys oh well you know-- okay okay i won't tell anyone well we have the king's hall board yo that's where the job postings are go fuck yourself no especially one if it's furry and you can pet it was he perchance named the gentleman oh shit do you know him okay that's the second verse are they going to have an orgy i'm asking that of claudia oh i'm running to find caleb oh you have to look through his eyes i just wanted to borrow some parchment do you have any extra pieces of paper though i don't know like 20 pieces a really long one i can make do with that yes thank you i've got you too i was spending my time cutting the parchment up into even little rectangles so i could make them into multiple pieces of paper i figured it was and caleb was lying to us the whole time usually in orgies like that they don't let you stay unless (tongue clicking) you're part of it eww nice so you did that to us it's a pretty big group there's nine of us are there i've only met one other person named beau i think his name was not the same beau as your beau it was a different beau i'm going to start folding my little pieces of paper into little trifolds aww i want a bath so bad but it's so late molly is it even going to be open at night okay i have important work to do i'll come with you too because i really want a bath it's folded like this travis and oh that's really bad it's because i'm folding paper four damn it if the people look like you and caleb they probably need it shitty people specifically i do i do get really mad i know oh no it makes sense when you're in that shirt before i go to sleep i'm going to use my little folded papers and make little pamphlets to the traveler so it's going to be like have you heard of our lord and savior the traveler he sure is the coolest everyone should worship him he's the best guy around they're like this little because i had to make them out of only two sheets of-- well however many i could make out of two sheets of parchment so probably like eight or maybe ten beau you know what we need to do today we need to go to the pillow place and go get some money from my mom you're not with us in our room right now how does he do that because i asked her for it yes but it's my mom and of course she's going to send me money you're crazy it's called the pillow trove we need to go there but we need to look very pretty so before that i'm going to see if molly wants to go get a bath yes we have to be fancy for that place we also need to go to the blacksmith you guys as i'm coming down the stairs we have so many things to sell good call plus we're good friends of claudia's and me and me and me they really are because we might make so much money from the blacksmith what's a tabard okay aw man that's true yeah we could be famous have you ever been famous you have no idea the kind of stuff that is given to you when you're famous want me to go tell him he's got it wrong okay i chase after him i chased after him already excuse me town crier man where does your news come from where is your boss located because your boss at the king's hall has some of his news-- his news is wrong did you know that the attack on alfield was defeated by a group called the mighty nein they're this really amazing band of heroes-- yes-- yes it is it's really cool because we were there and we saw it happen and it was really cool and you should probably get your news right-- okay because by the time though that we get there and then it gets back to you you've probably been around town so much and then you'll have to retract your article and that would be really weird fjord what is this is this a new accent you're trying out fjord you almost sound like caleb are you planning on sounding like caleb now what are you talking about accents are your strong suit you're really good at it fjord yeah wait can i tell it's not actually him can i tell it's not fjord that's the thing can i tell from the physicality because you do accents fjord you seem even weaker than you were before pulling me along this is weird (gasps) caleb is it really you okay just let go of my ear now okay hey man i was just doing what fjord told me to okay so don't you give me shit oh my gosh this is perfect because if we're called the mighty nein people will expect it to be a different group of people yeah that's actually brilliant he always knows what we're up to because he has his cat follow us you killed its baby yeah i'll lead the way thin as a wet toilet paper i take my pink bag and i put it down on the table in front of him hi we have things to buy and sell from you i pull out-- well it depends do you have a hand axe that i could buy hand axe something that is very sharp and can kill people okay put those on the table and then we will look at some other stuff first okay i have six short swords and i put them down on the table i've got two daggers here i've got two hand crossbows two light crossbows and two heavy crossbows maybe scrap metal is a good thing for this but also also we have some other things i have them we put everything in the bag then it would be good then we fucking had them around our necks we knew we were going to the blacksmith and they were magic they had to be real good metal to be magic this giant lion thing with a woman's head had them around it and then we killed the lion thing do we want both of the axes or just the one i need another weapon just one of the axes is all i need i don't need both sound good for you guys i like it i think that is a very good deal what's your name sir yannick i'm jester it's nice to meet you specifically one that's melting yeah the bath she's really scary i follow behind her and yell town crier has toilet paper stuck to her shoe (laughter) wait what did she just say we need to get a really big piece of vegetable ooh front of the blouse no she's alone ooh that's good oh my god in the time that nott was gone could i spot the allhammer temple just so i know where it is 12 are there people watching the board right now as soon as he walks away is there anybody any guards looking at the board that's a lot of guards at this one board can i try sleight of hand and just try to make that into wangstacker it was a 12 it makes more sense don't say it in the open you guys wait until we're in the bath it's tiny little fjord yes miss rima oh i think we plan on doing a lot of stuff so probably all together rima is there someone who can take clothing and clean it up as well while we are bathing you probably shouldn't though they can stitch up the holes and stuff no you were prestidigitation-ed ew like the poop splatter four silver i run by her and say cannonball and jump in hair like the little mermaid oh my god yasha is it all upper body what about the prince albert i do did you see what happened in alfield that was us we killed them all we told her where we were going to go we killed things for money oh are you free of bandages and everything too and we just can't see it mm-hmm so we still need a few people left did you know there's a spell that can do that you're not getting in the water you're just standing off to the side nott but you're naked you're ready to come in come into the-- what is it about it yeah see how did it feel are the old couple looking at us like we're weird is there anyone else in this pool with us yeah it's all ours it's a party room now myriad probably a bad thing to do platinum dragon (gasps) do you worship the traveler too oh okay i thought i would have known you if you did we have really small group meetings it's usually just me what about you yeah you don't have anything to hide from us everything is a milk bath he wanted people to join the military so no i like killing roving beasts nott do you want me to wash your hair for you no one will see because you look like fjord we made so much money off of ears and we're going to make a whole lot of gold over at the pillow trove it's a fancy hotel place mm-hmm she's the ruby of the sea i know you guys have really bad memories because it was not like this at all i've been sudsing up your hair you have to do it to dunk your hair which is whom are you from the menagerie coast as well are you from the empire sorry yasha this is a lot if you don't want to answer i understand i trust her fully you stand uncomfortably close to people you know and make them feel awkward and i walk really close to you fjord oh no fjord are you melting oh no you're turning into water okay yes is that what he was like he called us baby be like that they probably folded them up for us who gives up first while you guys do that i need to go to the pillow trove okay i need to go to the pillow trove which is the nice tavern in the place no that's fine it's a quick errand i just need to pop in and pop out you know how you do before we leave i run up and give yasha a hug and say i'm glad you're back okie-dokie yes we have business at the pillow trove oh well i have business at the pillow trove i have a package that's being delivered there what business do you have at the pillow trove oh yes i hired him to protect me because you know i'm very fragile and delicate but if he doesn't look well enough to be my guard you're welcome to walk me instead 22 (whispering) sorry caleb i'll let you know what it's like okay (whispering) frumpkin kitty kitty you guys are really on top of your shit in here no you said one point he kicked the highlights out of his hair he looks very embroidered and everything so they dispelled it what a dick like caesar's palace can i ask the guard what is that building no i'm new to town actually oh wow i didn't think you had things like this in the empire i'm from the menagerie coast actually nicodranas quite thank you very much kind sir i walk grandiosely up to the woman hello i have a package that's being delivered to here jester thank you very much is anybody watching me good day maybe under lavorre okay anything from the ruby of the sea maybe okay thank you i smile back at the guard like (pained laugh) this is crazy isn't it well that's really weird okay well tell you what how about because it's probably going to be coming you know i'm here really early for it you know-- so if it comes for me-- when it does-- could you leave word with the guard outside the tri-spire the guard house you know then i can come and ask if it's been delivered and then i can come because i don't want to have to walk all the way here you know if it's not here for me yet okay unless i should maybe stay here waiting for it oh yes how much would that be well i normally stay in the diplomatic rooms but i guess the smallest room because you know i'm small probably just tonight because it'll probably be here in the morning yes oh yes here you go
