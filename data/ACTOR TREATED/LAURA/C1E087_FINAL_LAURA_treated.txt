me so nauseous yes potentially yes i know right vex hasn't had a lot of experience with ships you know i may have fed a couple sharks in my lifetime i'm gonna fly down and tell captain adella oh oh it could be another ship possibly all right captain you'll get used to that someday (laughs) i see something on the horizon do you know of any masses in the area maybe a ship or island or-- do you have a telescope may i take that and fly up i swear i'll give it back i've got nowhere to hide up (screams) first one first one first one which of you okay okay okay okay shut up don't say it out loud shut

the fog is still there i was on my way over to the other-- -- towards the other ship okay percy wants to be dropped off at the crow's nest so i'll fly over that direction keeping an eye out for anything visible that i can shoot at flyby yeah uh-huh i'm on-- yeah i'm on my broom i'm just riding my bow around can i drift down to where i can see anything and i say to keyleth uh fog can you do

do a bramble shot again 'cause that was wasted or does that mean-- does a bramble shot only work if it connects okay okay i'm gonna try 19 yes okay 15 plus four lightning damage plus sneak attack woo an 11 for the sneak attack and hunter's mark and then the dc of 17 or be restrained that's strength save and i'm gonna do the bramble shot damage now hoo yes he's restrained ooh is that a sev-- that's a one 16 awesome and i say percy spellcaster right below you fish guy oh god i get 2d6 now for sneak attack another six bramble shot motherfucker ooh oh the fish guy and it'll probably get a chance to be unrestrained as soon as it's his turn we're kind of being ambushed so i don't think your cousins are fish people oh my nice we could steal this ship okay you might bring our ship down with it keyleth no but the chains attaching two ships oh shit like xena (war cry) what does xena do (xena fighting call) left and right damn i like to picture you in full armor with boat shoes on they're really pretty nice (explosion sound) is he not grappled anymore oh shit ooh honorable maybe they are what is he doing what (gasps) yeah i'm fine whoa trinket rolled so good hold on hold on holda hoda hoda hoda hoda 20 he was very zen about that duck down matrix style he's diving in no you guys well we're having a pirate battle yeah oh no (gasps) bro gosh thank god trinket ducked 18 bearly shank shank it's just two it's shank shank you're attacking the guy how'd you get all the way over there yes awesome cool then since he's got my brother next to him i'm gonna fly down so i can see him better and shoot him two times with my blazing bowstring on the first one blazing bowstring activate do i still get disadvantage okay 28 second attack is just-- can i do regular 18 12 with three points of lightning damage i'm about to 13 additional and then ten with the blazing bowstring-- nine more with the blazing bowstring and then my second attack-- 11 plus three lightning i don't get sneak attack again but i do get hunter's mark and three more for hunter's mark and i'm gonna fly back a little so he can see me less and then i'm going to have trinket for my bonus action-- -- run forward and attack the guy on the edge of the ship i know i know yeah because it's my bonus so he can just do one attack oh i could i didn't think i was allowed to do that i want him to do that that's what i wanted him to do athletics is that strength that's just five so trinket just stands up he's got his paws on his chest growls loudly into his face i mean that's scary a big bear especially if these guys are on the sea they don't see bears very often oh no that one was seriously bad trinket attacks him on the way over damn it we're all such dicks he's a fish that'll help him i don't think putting him in the water's gonna help us very much you could get rid of the fog get him is it listing towards keyleth and-- oh nice yeah that we see oh fuck one of our guys oh shit he is untameable why a demon okay i'll fly over to percy who's on the fucking ground and i say are you good lovely get off this boat and i'll fly over and try to help out the fight on the other side okay and then i'll shoot some arrows at-- i'll shoot 'em at the guy yeah oh disadvantage too oh damn it okay yeah but 20 on the first one and 15 plus seven on the second one 22 awesome oh jesus this is terrible this is terrible 17 plus three lightning damage and then 16 plus two lightning damage and then for my bonus action trinket's gonna-- and it was sneak attack because there's something next to him huh (cackles) five for sneak attack and then trinket will attack him too okay yes that is-- what is that a bite attack sure it's a bite attack a 24 it's 11 good job boy yeah it's great i wish scanlan could've been here to see that he's had more than one no if this doesn't end it hey you almost lost that gauntlet i know if there were slaves-- fingers crossed let's not do that to keyleth we really should've kept one of them alive yeah what if there's a map to treasure 30 seconds yeah i want to fly down and help percy investigate if there's time you might did you ever hear that i wanted to go help percy investigate was i able to do that anything interesting what are you listening for can i hear anything with my elven ears what do your elf eyes see oh nothing it was a one that was awful we should get

him on my lap as i was flying back i wanted to make sure they were okay (gasps) oh no i roll him on his side (vomit noise) and he's dead dead dead oh no you keep scooching back pat pat pat pat pat yeah well i cast cure wounds while that happens so go fuck yourself i feel like we're finding percy all over again on a boat how long have you been in that cell we're your saviors can i insight check him and make sure i just don't trust anyone ooh natural 20 wow wow wow oh it is it's hotis it's hotis don't worry your captors have been defeated you're safe what's your name tempest fang weeks ooh again again oh but do you just wanna hang out over here 'cause travis is just gonna fuck with your shit again that would be so cool can we get some food i was talking back to captain adella or one of the crewmates not you grog first mate was he a pirate forgive us we have to be a bit wary plus he's so frail right now i'm afraid grog would just break him in half yes do i see any like clasp markings on him at all those scars on your body were they from before you were captured or after what were they doing to you yeah i asked if they would bring him food i asked him to bring food because he's been in a cage for two weeks they didn't feed him very much thenton you will forgive us if we don't give you free rein of the ship while you're on here we'll promise not to poke you (laughs) of the ashari a-- yeah defeaters of dragons no big deal trinket gets up and starts dancing around like he knows what to do when we say we're performers she's a sailor too that's all right he can stay on the boat yeah we'll give him food it's all right right captain captain have you heard of the tempest fang oh really -- 17 other companies oh yeah i put them in the bag of colding for the time being pull it out shit do we understand that's great you can identify things how many times a day can you do that are you an arcane user so basically it's you you can use it i mean hold on to it in case we run into scanlan again or you can use it oh i have a spyglass i didn't even need to ask for captain adella's that's cool super useful deedee cool no we have rooms but they're combined i don't know you've been tinkering a lot lately no this is that night yeah i did want to talk but that's okay i can talk later yeah no i was going to taliesin well i was going to say you're welcome we're finishing up you're welcome in oh only when you're finishing up hello is it filled with smoke in here oh hi tary i didn't see you fun exciting on a boat even wow so what'd you make (laughs) oh oh shit that's powerful oh wow you guys made a-- wow it's a lot it's just a lot of spots right now but i'm sure eventually oh pretty um get out you not you if you don't mind i mean of course you can stay-- (quietly) hi so percy i've been meaning to bring something up to you at the risk of bringing up scanlan again-- something i'd rather ignore when he left he said something that caught my ear which was that he heard he heard pike and his daughter calling to him from the other side which is strange really because when i was on the other side i don't remember hearing anything what about you busting out the courage again mm all right i'm not embarrassed (laughs) well that's good i would hope he's not waiting on the other side for you what about when you were killed by raishan you can always tell me your fears percy i don't i suppose it depends on them doesn't it you don't think they were doomed to suffer the same fate that you were oh no (gasps) maybe we can just try that on someone who we already need to kill right (laughs) are you listening i'm sure that's how they feel no one's ever sure they're doing the right thing no it's all right takes the pressure off really knowing that you know yes so serious (exasperated voice) you can go play with tary some more if you like great then you can play with me (all laugh) we go running up oh no we're at a reef broom trinket will get in a boat with grog no trinket's gonna be in my necklace yeah for a minute no he can't it's too heavy it's too heavy for the carpet get him on a boat get on a boat tary (laughs) mm mm-hm uh-uh nah keyleth oh he has legs man they must have the pruniest feet (laughs) (yells) do not kill got it (laughs) because he makes the lodestones basically is there something that helps those of us who don't breathe underwater breathe underwater yes no we are going to-- -- we're going to steal some kraken's poop (laughs) (excited shouting) we're gonna drink most of it yeah taliesin don't 'cause we don't kill the kraken c oh my goodness oh my god ew rad definitely on tuesday totally real i know
