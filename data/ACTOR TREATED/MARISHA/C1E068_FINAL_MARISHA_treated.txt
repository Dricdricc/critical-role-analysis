that's the winner (laughter) that's going to be the next show i produce let's make a poll with sam riegel keep going speaking of shows i produce (cheering) right am i right so signal boost is back it never went away you didn't realize that but it's back (laughter) it feels like it went away it did not you just forgot about it it's back with damion poitier he's awesome he was thanos the first thanos before he got replaced because celebrities are dicks and-- right he was also chains in payday which is what everyone has been now shouting at us through twitter he was he gets killed in civil war-- technically tranquilized apparently is what he clarified anyway-- other than being chains being on social media people have also shouted he's very attractive and sexy so maybe that's a selling point for you so you should go watch it it's out right now his second episode is out this past tuesday go watch him he's funny he's very charming (sings) merchandise the guys like to get 'em and put them on their middle fingers so that you can flick off-- oh nice the patchwork ones those are good i'm just showing up on the beach we had just landed no there was one that i might have crushed underneath me that went down there were also others on the ship correct yeah you know there might be a couple if they're real good swimmers they might make it with severe burns and psychological damage but-- maybe thanks also my control weather spell should still be active so nature check druid check what the shit is happening check nurture check nature versus nurture check 14 i toss percy his gun as a druid would i recognize if this is an air elemental situation ugh why are they always intelligence-- natural 20 bigger badder aw snap (sighs) this isn't great i don't either i'm assuming there hasn't been enough time to where we've taken a short rest correct not good you guys five (clears throat) five [no audio] from the last fight [no audio] (singing) it takes two baby yeah we need to have breakfast what the fuck both it'll work they take half damage for shit well you take damage and then whatever damage that you take that is carried over into your real form so if you take 80 hit points you'll take you know the ten that your eagle form took and then you'll take the other 70 you'll be fine you're grog you got it it's also the air druid you've been travelling with uses a lot of lightning (coughs) what's up brah yeah that hits that also hits oh hey gary what's up aww man god damn it gary you were always a dick 14 okay 27 total okay so not feeling great about this one i could try and talk to them but that never goes well let's be real so i'm going to cast wind wall okay here's my question i'm having a hard time seeing so help me that's me who's that okay i have a 50-foot wind wall that i can shape whichever way i want so what i want to do is try and loop us all in and go around jesus go around this way yes like a semi-circle starting with this guy going this way 50 feet because it can go over top of guys so starting 50 feet going around this way the other way but yeah i mean it's 50 feet it'll work i guess it doesn't ultimately matter a circle i want to block the three guys out with my 50 feet i want to go over top of them and keep us nice and safe and comfy in a wind basket whatever 50 feet will cover because there's a little overlap so can i start it with this guy and then go around to where that couple feet goes to this guy oh okay that's all i care about i say that's a big tornado i can make a bigger one 19 uh-huh and they should be gaseous forms if i'm not mistaken which means they can't move through it that's right they are i'm done i'm excited that's my thing that's all i do oh sorry nature 13 damage not great 13 total can i now shift away from the guy he can't move through i'll turn to them and be like let's do the mirror game man do the mirror game yeah and that's it you've seen sharknado percy we've got cows you'll reach triple digits some day sorry you left our huddle you hit so easily he rolled six six six from the inside kill it kill it we're level elitists for two more games it should only affect ranged attacks it should only affect ranged attacks and gaseous creatures because i doubled checked that can it do that it can move through the wind keep going i'm going to cross-reference that keep going i'm just checking nah keep going see how tall it is all right yep nope it is 15 feet high you're correct he hops the fence who me what strength 19 goddamn it gil you're an anomaly we wonder why there's the west nile virus percival he who breaks wind (laughter) 15 right in the middle i suddenly remember the letters that i stole from the ship and i say percival and i pull them out i'm not giving them to you i'm going to look at them with you okay upon looking at them i don't get it and i hand them to him that was for bad news do we have time oh you're going to drag my shame into shore so wait what are the two marbles they look like rocks so it's like a stone is it pretty that's cool they're flares that's cool that was the perfect interaction can i keep an eye out for that flower i grab a few put them in my bag yeah i second that question and can i keep my senses aware for aboriginals of the island natural 20 22 and does the vegetation seem to be getting thicker (whispering) you got this (whispering) i believe in you (quietly) but there might be we do know for whatever she has blocked my scrying so whatever it is blocked my magic percy i think you are the distraction are you going to be the distraction well hang on if we have the flares that she recognized with her crew why not use the flare that her crew has it won't alarm her to an outsider she already got away from us once by using magical abilities to blink out of existence we have to make sure we lock her down so she doesn't run scanlan can you do that i have a hold person spell i can try and hold her i'm going to creep forward and towards grog but being very stealthy 20 total i'm going to try and hold ripley with a hold person i can lock her down i'm going to take a few steps forward like two boxes forward and i'm going to release a hold person on ripley casting it yeah i'm not letting it go 19 she's got to make a wisdom save fucking fuck it 19 oh my god (cheering) did you say we have-- no he has advantage 12

on what happens he's stuck in a tornado if he tries to break free well that's fun yeah i've never done this before so this is cool yeah can i do that now or next turn i didn't that's true where was ripley last seen that's probably what i would try to do i would push it that way yep he's fucked yeah he's stuck in a tornado she has to save from it she either gets sucked up in it or flung so she's going to get fucked either way i don't know it's not necessarily a spell on her i made the spell around her what no come on kynan little shit i get plus five that hits my armor class is 17 plus five
