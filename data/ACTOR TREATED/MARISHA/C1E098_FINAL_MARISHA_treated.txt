it's like cooking mama are we talking about next week that's a big one you won't be there to put my face in lava this time i'll just have myself to do that are you going to bring back scanlan my mother has never been so proud of me i was questioning myself i was like there was no way something was called the grumpy lily did you mention us or anything else so you didn't even offer up the information there's no such thing as family problems being okay for forever grog what exactly is your duty that you are feeling inclined towards damn it grog yeah maybe she's also a badass that's not a problem yeah but grog does bring up a point that i was trying to make before he started laughing when i said duty (giggles) but what are you committed to keeping your family around you said you were compelled and you felt like you had a duty but then you immediately started talking about-- tearing your family apart and stopping them if there's one thing i understand it's giving your life to a cause no dedicating time is a gift i would say so dedicating that gift is it's a big thing but i hope you believe in it we believe in you you don't care bottle of wine she's awesome i thought you said that was because of the aloe vera right yeah salt air is better for you life needs moisture to live it's way smarter-sounding do you have a shiraz i was just wondering if you had any imports do you have a red wine let's just take them all i mean we have-- oh it's fine that's true look at pike's grandpa can i take the bread crumbs from the corner and throw it down so the rats could have it yeah i'll hang with grog and pike okay wait before we go any further wait do i have to be doing a short rest to do the inspiring leader thing oh never mind i'm new to the being an inspiring leader thing i should've done that at the bar okay okay as we walk i'll be like you know what guys i've had a lot of time to think over the year that we've been away-- and i feel like we've grown so much as people and you guys are family you're a family to me and i go on for a while do you guys remember that time in stillben when we very first met and we all didn't really like each other and grog i don't think you understood me for a while yeah that's fine that's fair hey grog do you remember that one time-- do you remember that time-- i think it was the first time i made you laugh and i turned into an earth elemental and then pretended to do an i'm going down the stairs thing through the floor yeah i just remembered that the other day and i just love you guys so much you know yeah i don't think you were around yet but i love you so much oh yeah you want to mock until you realize you get your hit points and i love you guys i love you guys so much not showing your sensitivity do you have a shiraz i like these people and then the defenders go to another in case shit goes bad i like that vex tary i feel like you guys are good talkers i'll sit with grog and pike write that shit down can keyleth get up and walk past the diplomats' table and run my hands-- oh we're at the same table now oh so we scootched together okay then i'm just going to lean into vex and give her an enhance ability on her charisma you get advantage-- yeah on checks her cleavage gets a little nicer hey who's the change-bringer does anyone know i feel like this drink is inspired can i do a check to see aw i'm not good at this pike you know gods oh please i have no idea i definitely have zero idea oh yeah of course we knew that it just sounded fancy mimic vex i'm following your lead look at you need to make some more money what are you learning about the man by what he drinks oh really they didn't give you the same cup i'm so bored i scoot with grog i get up with grog too oh i have to pee do you want to go pee yeah i start paying attention to the room as well with grog you could marry the girl or we could go kill an ancient being yeah you are very skilled in hiring talented mercenaries that might be your strongest suit vax says yes and so do i aye i think we've all risked our lives for each other at one point and another so it's your turn tary welcome to the family okay to camilla you'll win it if you spell it right i could scry on the area if i knew enough about it that's fine it's 120 miles yep i'm pretty fresh all right before we leave is there any type of research we should potentially do i mean just in case there's maybe some ancient deity that rules over the forest of herethis and some sort of goddess fuck it let's go trial run well once again-- duty (laughter) that we gave scanlan but he hasn't yeah maybe he threw it into the ocean for all we know it would be a massively dickish move and do what convince him to come back see if he's okay ask him how his year's been yeah you didn't want me to even scry on him and now we're talking about just popping in on him i feel like there's a weird crossing of the lines oh man grog you guilted me very hard on that you made me feel kind of shitty no you kind of got it right just go with it taliesin and and no one has heard from him at all over the course of the year she's messing with you that's kind of cute yeah what time is it what do you mean by-- finale yeah well we can float down and when you mean seared like acid or like heat i'll start setting up camp five yeah it's a dick that could be a glabrezu which fucking killed you the first time they have pincers i don't know skittering beasts the smaller one does it sound like anything we have encountered a nature check would i have an advantage with my little book 19 an ankheg so they snatch cattle-- oh my god you guys perfect opportunity liam and yeah let's have a heroes' feast which-- okay hang on let me check here i can do a heroes' feast okay but my wind walk-- i already wind walked so i can do a heroes' feast at a higher level i also want to do a 5th-level commune with nature what should i ask what should i ask that we don't already know well i can see in a two- three-mile radius i was thinking that okay first and foremost influences from other planes of existence okay planar long dormant okay so something planar yeah that was our first fight no i can it's a terrain question so terrain yeah how deep does this mine go is i think i can right can i sense the location of where-- yeah 400 meters and the entity lies at the bottom yeah we're gods it's only a little bit more than 1000 feet now i know looney tune physics doesn't work in this world always keyteor it lies at the bottom ankhegs can i get a sense of how many and whereabouts the ankhegs are how many that's a problem about how many do i know about how many there are sensing their skittering movements under the surface because this is a three-mile radius right there's a lot so does it have anything to do with this no i'm bad at this (groans) are you serious shut up can i druidcraft some web hammocks look i really like elaborate tree houses i can have a rope bridge here i'll pass we'll just sleep with the ones we have or whatever heroes' feast is this including or not including the chalice that grog gave to vex earlier to drink out of it's got michael's michael's crafts how do you turn it off cover it in blankets yeah 2d10 yeah (gasps) ooh wait yeah ooh that's amazing it's a nine and a ten but this is going to be a long rest but then at the top of the morning i can give us another speech do i have to do it fuck you travis fuck you right i can do an interpretive dance a laser light show with fireflies it's like in a disney imagineer show all right well it's a speech so in the top of the morning laura and that's great because one can only bullshit so much in a four-hour fucking game i talk about the smell of our breakfast it's bacon in the morning and taste and smell the fleshy essence of the pork no bacon is definitely worth fighting for bacon is worth fighting for and when we kill that celestial baby we will have the godliest bacon one could ever imagine she's not a great talker and has never been one just want to point that out you guys all know this that's the one that kerr bear took liam and yeah i'm all right i'll light my hands on fire so that vex can light her arrows on fire they'll be 400 meters down i could theoretically drop some awesome fireballs on their face potentially i don't know that's a weird magic question if i drop a fireball how long it'll go-- will it keep going but i could keyteor to the bottom yep advantages to both i rolled 19 but then you get an additional 17 because my weird speech about bacon look it was inspired okay i'm not wrong bacon has saved many a people i mean i have a few daylight spells i'm down with that mini nuke it extends a lot of our magical ranges unless i want to keyteor down there are definitely a lot of trees yeah well i can polymorph him hang on before we go there's a few things i want to do let me double-check-- i don't want to be a dumbass hang on wait i might need the book okay one of the things i want to do is i want to use my staff to create an air elemental so i want to take a minute to use my spire to conjure an air elemental what i'm going to conjure an air elemental and then i'm going to go over to grog and i'm going to give him a big hug and say for the next hour no one can keep a hold of you and i'm going to give him freedom of movement you can't be grappled you're also unaffected by difficult terrain and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained you're parkour because i feel like you've been restrained a lot yes i know i'm wondering if i should ahead and go elemental but i can't cast can i get on the carpet is there room did you cast pass without a trace 37 i know primordial i can also just cast daylight by the by oh that's good oh shit holy shit 19 that's cool sick 17 okay i'm going to take and control my air elemental and send him over 42 so i have to get over-- i have advantage on these what's 17 plus four thank you gil all right so (boom) i send him over with my staff it has 90-feet fly speed and he's going to go ahead and do a whirlwind the creatures in his space have to make a dc 13 strength saving throw that's what i hoped they take 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage oh that's nasty 12 plus seven is 19 plus two so 21 and they are flung up to 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked prone and are knocked prone do i still have line of sight yeah i'm going to get off the carpet and walk over just to where i have line of sight even though my mantle allows me to ignore the penalties of dangerous weather effects i'm a warcaster though man because that's eight so i just have to get over a ten right rolled a 13 okay can i move over to where i have line of sight okay can i do blight i think my spell level so 20 8d8 no fail one two three four give me two more one more and another give me a d8 okay no on elementals four five nine 14 plus eight is 22 plus four is 26 plus two is 28 28 blight damage fucking lava that's not bad 19 no 18 i turn to everyone behind me and i go aw fuck it's fine all right on my elemental yeah 13 plus my constitution right yeah i'm good that's why i cast it on him man oh fuck one of these guys what a wall wait you're buried too i'm under the wall right yeah my air elemental is there what do you mean i'm underground right (growls) i'm going to go earth elemental do i have enough movement to earthglide to them i think 60 earthglide okay can i come up from underground grab them and then beat them into the ground that's cocked natural 20 on that one and a four on a second one which is 12 and then you double the 2d8 six doubled which is 12 plus five doubled which is ten so that's 22 i know just the dice is 22 plus five so 27 and i just want to hold onto it and be like yo yo air elemental and then let my air elemental come over and do its thing double slam attack slam attack no i'm going to do a multi attack two slam attacks so 2d8 plus eight once again that's an 18 and a 17 plus eight yeah so 26 and 25 which is 3d8 plus two so the first one oh six seven eight plus seven which is 15 for the first one 15 plus two 17 and then the second one is eight plus two fives which is 18 plus two so 20 constitution that's part of my physical stats as being an elemental correct it's con strength and dex never mind yeah 15 there's no way unless i roll a nat 20 they just do their own thing if you fail i rolled a 19 can i not fade it after this oh i can drop concentration on it and then it will go away right to be fair didn't it also get affected by the blast i rolled a 13 plus two so 15 it only has 90 hit points so it's fine guys it's fine yeah glitter gets everywhere i run over to grog i'm still an elemental yeah i am still an elemental where is he you point i earthglide and i find him and i can do double damage to structures can i beat him out i don't want to kill him by suffocating i go over to the glitter and i get some of my potion bottles from my alchemy to-- oh i'm actually good at this i try and harvest some sweep some glitter okay so i get everybody in the middle is everyone ready what do you mean you need help i go (boom) and i pull grog through oh the carpet i take a few minutes as my earth elemental self to beast through i can do double damage to structures oh okay go get the carpet oh we're doing damage as we fly out oh are we just riding up broom and carpet broom and carpet i can do we need to on the top of my spire i cast daylight are they attracted to the daylight lower than a 13 can i do a wind wall to protect us from around us are we doing one more round if we are i will prep my wind wall spell to encompass us for one more round i'm good 21 21 yeah and i can drop a fireball on there yeah and i'll throw a fireball burn the place down extermination that was awesome i am going to be looking at all of my spells what why i'm going for the machete i love you (sizzling) then pike did it to me immediately the next round i love you (sizzling) yes it was
