tomorrow fridays who goes up next you're a celebrity what yeah you're like the most interesting man in the world it's fantastic 80 i took damage i'm sorry it wasn't my fault i lost concentration blame the dragon that did 40 damage wait not yet stone stone you've got a ride animal handling i'm going to drop and i'll start focusing on the gatestone one minute baby khaleesi where am i in my minute shitty gi joes they're both falling yeah vax will hit the ground first i'm hoping you can hold on for a minute but who's on the lowest hit points do you still have polymorph fuck so cute i'm technically an earth elemental still you know it was a good idea when he was still in the dragon 200 feet that's all right well what's below me i would hit zero hit points as an earth elemental and go back to keyleth right but 200 feet that's survivable yeah it's roughly 60 points and i've got 67 left as this earth elemental hang on wait wait wait if i'm going to do this i'm going to do it right i'm going to ball up like a cannonball and light up my hands that i keep forgetting because i didn't know i could do them in elemental form by the way thought it was only beast form i'm going to light myself on fire and go meteor i was trying to leave an impression no pun intended i drop and i stand up keyleth in the middle of a giant crater yeah that's me sounds kind of fun are any of them still alive it's funny we almost just died fighting the dragon how ironic i'm actually great i'm just in a smoldering meteor and look like a badass how much longer is he going to be tiny i just have such a hard time taking you seriously right now i'm so sorry so shale did you and your scouting party find out any additional information that might be handy what she said all right a lot of them we hope i could use a short rest we're trying to catch the dragon while he's still debilitated right we don't know what he has access to reserves what do you mean i can get us there via trees i need to know a tree that's there i could scry look for the closest tree teleport us there but by the time i'm getting there i'm exhausted if i scry i mean i guess i can look around and take a guess yeah so i can teleport us closer and then walk or we can take a very short rest so i can get my beast shaping back and then could fly a few more of us it's a gamble wait what what was that shale is that true just let him believe it oh yeah sure so are we resting how long would the hike up the mountain be an hour so we couldn't do round trips anyway they'd dissipate well yeah we rest and then go if we rest for 30 minutes and then i switch and then we have the eagles then we can get up in another 30 minutes and then it's an hour theoretically short resting is our shortest i do but then we'd still have to hike how long would the hike be i'm tapping myself-- i can do it but i'm tapping myself out i'm burning literally all my top level spells and i have no beast shapes left but i can do it it's what we think is most important can i rest can i rest while the first round goes it's for you guys yeah we're good yeah i want to rock back and forth in a corner i can try and scry inside the cavern get a battle perspective all right you have to give me a few minutes is everyone all right with that natural 20 hey i take a little of the soot and i give myself some druid battle make-up i'm about to pretentious asshole yeah my staff doesn't have a name it's so true all right i scry i focus really hard on the dragon yeah sure can i have some of the-- i scrape a little stomach bile-- wait he's going to sense what i can scry can't he maybe i can just try and scry inside the lair i mean he knows we're coming yeah yeah actually can i do that like it's a camera drone sure i want to try and focus on umbrasyl's whereabouts but i want to see if i can get a nice bird's-eye view of inside the cavern 19 ah (laughter) no but i heard him he sounds very rough or possibly sleeping i don't know there was a lot of heavy breathing very deep-- not you know shallow breathing not impassioned breathing scanlan he could i guess still be invisible also the cave was covered in acid pools and dark and dingy and everything else we would expect i know i don't think he caught my presence i don't think he's necessarily expecting us we can have the element of surprise here i cast protection from acid on grog again shale you seem almost like you're-- as i was saying you seem like you're almost expecting to die or you're looking forward to it all right just checking that we wouldn't disappoint you if you don't die shale what type of magic do you wield exactly okay very clear so remember acid pools everywhere do we have any type of cohesive plan or just-- i do have faerie fire you combine the two things that you said and it's fantastic wait who's climbing where 19 i love rocks okay what's happening where am i oh right you're so tiny right now i keep forgetting that do you want me to put you in a little pouch could be like a kangaroo i think like seven pretty sure my arcana-- it's seven scanlan it's a very pretty rock-- pike these are very attractive rocks what does it look like no what does it look like is it like a slate i can alter their shape i can melt i can do something with them what do you mean they're not real hang on we might be able to circumvent it right can we go around it is there room on either side of them how about this i'm going to cast stoneshape and can i carve out a little path around one of them on the edge carve a little recess rocks i can do it two more times all the way into the cavern oh shitballs whoa percy he rolled a natural 20 17 natural 20 he did insect plague 14 whoa what's up oh it's something my grandma would say so good if i move through insect plague will i take damage or is it if i end in it that's true you waltzed through it and you didn't start in it did you oh but you took the damage up top you didn't take damage again after you got out of it all right i want to see if i can move i'm having a hard time seeing matt can i get my full movement of 30 feet into this corner here yeah oh really i can parkour it yeah 14 oh okay i think the dragon is roughly here i'm really sorry grog i'm going to cast faerie fire roughly-- yeah somewhere where i think he is means you don't have acid resistance anymore it's a concentration spell but none of us can see him yeah and with my bonus action-- he's going to do his thing isn't he great fuck you asshole okay but it's gone they're gone what a dick i know i don't think i'm going to go into my beast shape form so i can do another spell next turn can i just tuck and see if i could take a bonus action to hide in this little nook and cranny here because i'm not a rogue can i hug that pillar and say (panting) as long as you get out of it enough to negate the disadvantage that's a thing that can happen all right oh thank god no chris no monstah kill him liam taliesin and okay faerie fire (poof) right in front of me right on top of him it gives everybody advantage on attacks against him i hope he's got enough hit points to make it worth it yeah take it bitch glitter bomb it's like a kesha music video you're so pretty i'm going to use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental yeah that's how i roll travis and can i move am i in his range of attack honestly umbrasyl is so fucking big i can't see what's going on in front of me is scanlan in front of me can i step in the front and shield scanlan what about anybody else okay i'm next to shale as well right we're all in the shit together oh shale's over there you know what i'm just going to stay there kill it fucking kill it disco dragon we also have heroes' feast up by the way if that makes any amount of difference kill it advantage all day advantage all day big money no whammies that's good sorry excitement he's bad at it most of the time because he's a fighter he gets three attacks per round it's like a john wu film (burbling) come on bitch come on totally fine i'm an elemental for a reason halved yeah it has damage resistance against acid bludgeoning piercing slashing from non-magical weapons what did you say not bad not bad hang on sorry just my straight modifier it's not a save okay 18 whoa daddy all right half the damage i receive so yeah i'm good i'm golden so it wouldn't give us disadvantage it would just be straight rolls come on come on scanlan consult the helix down bitch down without advantage even though he's retreating even though he's retreating in faerie fire that doesn't double it okay letting you do this be thankful of what you have 22 exactly shit balls low shit eight damage from the elemental and we decided i don't get my fire hands when i'm a water elemental yeah all right here it comes 12 dc 23 did he get out of the darkness ooh ouch not good at all what am i making just a constitution check i don't think it's going to be enough eight shit fuck yes awesome i'm into this percy needs it i'm up no shit wow okay it's really far away though now yeah way more than 30 feet right what is he how far away is he from me yeah you're holding your action for someone to get up close oh you already did it yeah i guess i'm going to dash and see if i can get to him 30 feet i guess so you witnessed it you're a third party it's good no it failed breath recharged fuck it's like a 23 save right but it doesn't matter six kill him motherfucker kill him this fucker's got to be close to death right i drop my water elemental form nice holy shit grog keyleth drops elemental form and goes over to vax and grabs him by the face i tap him on the face and say so glad you're not dead and i walk away keyleth walks over and pulls out her hunk of quall i'm going to quall it up all over top of the gold see if anything lights up with my wi-fi detector since that's what i feel like it is we have to go back and get fassbender there were still a few members of the herd still alive a good half dozen yeah exactly did we contribute any of our own gold into this pile let's divvy it up is he still tiny he's still tiny we need fassbender yes 100 percent i start going to town on it yeah percy do you have any extra vials empty vials for blood hey percy so glad you're alive and not burning in acid do you have any extra vials i'll take that 16 for a 27 nature check yeah 27 i want to harvest some scales some blood and some teeth plus he had three in his bag of holding i hand the three vials of blood to vex to put in the bag of colding we should make some sweet necklaces
