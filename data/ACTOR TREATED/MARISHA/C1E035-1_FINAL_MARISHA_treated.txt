new comic yes based off of real events that happened in real life and in game i think ashley but the pitchers is actually how you have to do it so but we just didn't post-- it's like the rules are for alcohol commercials as long as you're not actually physically drinking it it's fine and it's got the seal of approval yeah there was a new super power beat down that came out today where we are challenging darth maul versus spider-man because why not why not but you should check it out because we have a very fun cameo by someone who i don't want to spoil it's not sam no it's really not but

critmas a little bit yep we'll leave it at that acid sucks i never want to encounter acid again every time we do it's bad it's always bad preserves apples yep probably that would have been bad save versus uranus is that what you said i was yelling in the earpiece fuck it run what why the-- why i didn't either did your computer die a payload he called you a payload are we out of the room (slowly) no i didn't oh god be careful no i tried to jam a piece of the magic glass the jammy magic glass into it and-- i'm probably lucky that i was able to pull away as quickly as i did because i think it eats everything around it still there yeah it's doing its really fast spinny thing i thought i could maybe go into my wildshape and bring down the building i thought maybe if i collapsed the building maybe it was drawing some sort of energy from the net of intertwined bodies but i couldn't because it was blocking all magic capabilities pike i'm a little shaky group hug should i stabilize her roll high she's rolling is she just unconscious he's whispering about the whispered one oh boy cassandra is there any reason why they'd want to sacrifice you in particular (mumbles) you have advantage yeah
