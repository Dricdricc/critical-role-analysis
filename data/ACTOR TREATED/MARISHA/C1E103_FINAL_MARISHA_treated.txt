tell your friends tell your wives boosting taliesin they're peppered in between the beauty of that is you're not sure which ones are true and which ones aren't they're back and forth the bees are true it's so good i feel like we invented a new form of theater it's weird shipmates until tomorrow adam lawson was the director sean and i were the producers disintegrated i saw it happen and then i saw it happen no we brought-- that's the ultimate question isn't it i've never done this before i recently learned a spell that i could attempt but it's nothing i've tried before and it's expensive and i'm already terrified of the fate and the hell that i might have brought him in his final moments i think he saw himself die i think i'm so sorry i cast foresight on him and i think there was a thing for a second i haven't thought of those ramifications of something like that before i think he was held and there was nothing he could do what if that happened what if he saw himself die i need 25000 gold pieces worth of diamonds i need 25-- we're in the feywild do not touch it percy keyleth goes over to vex and curls up into her what i don't know i half-heartedly do a gust cantrip while still sitting next to vex i seem them moving in that direction and once again poof for them even beyond the diamonds this was supposed to be a weekend trip just a weekend trip even after we find 25000 gold pieces worth of diamonds i've never brought anyone back before and this is versus the raven queen how do we know if his soul is even available for return maybe we should talk to the raven queen same way that he did maybe our werewolf friends are still around we don't have a body so we're basically making a diamond vax i can make animals i can make animals what did kraghammer mine what was their deal what if we go to a mine we could go straight to a source buy direct we can't we have to sleep before unless there's a portal nearby that we can get through it has to be nearby plane shift is general i pick an area and it gambles where it's going to drop us i did i said the shademirk bog and the pond the glade i found the page in my notes and rambled all the names off very quickly in a panic didn't we-- nope i plane shifted us out (horrified wail) no no don't consider it pike no 31 all of us what do you want to do with delilah they like us now yeah we cuddle between the armor that's the saddest thing jacking off oh man don't die forever you don't want to be exhausted how long does he have to rest so he's not exhausted is this your nymph we're asleep what's going on pike pike i need you to tell me before i come around this corner and see i am not coming with you until you tell me pike i clutch onto vax's armor will you come here for a second okay i could hear everything that's going on because it's down the tree no i'm super not okay what's going on what the fuck is going on fuck all of you for a fucking second just tell me i have his armor okay you go first i'll follow you i follow her down does he feel cold is it you i thought i killed you i could have done more you're cold i put my ear up to his chest natural 18 24 okay i give him back the armor percy how long do we have you what do you remember anything no we fucking can't as far as i'm concerned you can drop dead in front of our faces right now and it wouldn't be much different than the past 24 hours we saw her face surprise wait what i gave you back your armor and shit he's got a cloak over him you're here until the job's complete right or she feels that you've paid your service i feel like i remember you telling me in bedside chat at some point in time over the 15 months or is your soul yours again are her deals final so that's it your purpose is to make sure that the rest of us find long happy lives at the cost of your own we need to talk to the raven queen we need help i don't accept this as a closed contract does he get a bonus to ac streaker's sprint i admire how you're really sticking to that i'm in awe i'm impressed attempt to resurrect you don't worry about it we should probably get back very quickly before too much time passes we've already slept here vasselheim the guy who messed with us for three days is it possible i thought gods were supposed to be all omnipresent and whatnot knock knock hello i bamfed into your universe i don't know i do like new vax's tenacity it does immediately become the concern that i can't get us anywhere unless i have some sort of item generally a tuning fork or some sort of attuned item to that plane to get us there you said your god the raven queen she's the one who transitions people maybe she can help does that mean i should go talk to melora i feel like when you're in the same clique when you're on the same level everyone talks right so we have a short list is what we're saying do we each get different suits matching suits but in different colors god powers put her on our to-call list is it better to do that here or on the prime material plane or does it really matter also the longer we're here potentially the more time gets wonky okay let's go i immediately look around in a 360 very quickly does there look like any big cities that should not be here 19 what wisdom saving throws am i (laughs) yeah bringing it back in the long run i think this is going to be better for you do we need to stop by the temple of the raven queen okay do you want a teammate to go with you do you want to pick someone where was the melora grove thing that we buried senokir's wife's ashes where is that but it's here should i go talk to melora should i go try and recruit melora team sarenrae and team melora i'm just trying to save time this is great pike is this how you learned all of your stoneworking stuff it's good like a druid could do it it's very impressive good craftsmanship i didn't realize how crazy it sounds until you say it out loud she just gave us a key do i recognize what it is she gave us a key to plane shift there this is the tuning fork that i needed hang on do other gods live there three mimosas later and three hours later (slurring) and he totally didn't call us back and i told him i'm not getting back together again did i figure that out with my check or no yeah how much time has it been it's frozen it's the same day we left oh cool we lucked out yay amazing work if you need any landscaping done don't be afraid to ask pike can get you in touch with me yeah it's fine we know people you were with him as tary they did that not us fighting gods one day getting arrested in the street the other day you are at 27 wait nope i lied how many points you're at half you're at 13 hit points normally i'm the one who's arrested mixing it up is this wisdom well they have keen sight so they have advantage on wisdom checks and the wisdom is plus two although don't you maintain-- so plus two and you have advantage they just have advantage on perception checks do you think that guy went and alerted everyone about vecna probably vecna vecna's a much bigger problem right did you get allegiance from the lord of the crossroads right you were gone for what 45 minutes melora doesn't exist on that plane no the fire ashari why alerting the cities no all right let's mist there misting to the fire ashari is not that long right that's what i thought a couple of hours maybe we should tree stride there i take that back we tree stride transport via plants i always say that wrong tree stride's a 5th-level spell tree stride i have a lot of stuff going on i immediately look for cerkonos tell him what happened light the fire orbs the chaos orbs crisis orbs the city-- thar amphala laura and i believe it teleported somewhere in the northern hemisphere somewhere in a cold region we think wildemount you might want to check in with our contacts there they might have the best knowledge well that's why we're alerting you first possibly worse after this i'm retiring we are going to be going to the blessed fields of elysium from here thank you okay he might not be in wildemount i don't know 350 miles northwest if you speak to the other ashari and my father let him know thank you cerkonos kaitiaki let's go do we need anything else it's a good plane of existence let's just give vecna the prime material plane let's stay here new plan new plan stay here you're going to be at ax also meg and wendy are going to have a booth there so you can go to artists' alley i think they said 11am go onto their twitter but anyway they're going to be there i've lost my druid die actually max is this still a thing apparently the critters got you ice cream someone got you ice cream ben and jerry's our producer is gone
