we miss you guys here look we'll break reality look at yourself tips for being chaotic neutral audience yeah travis take it away (laughter) stand up so the people on the other end of the world can see you she's super cool keyleth thinks she's super cool yeah man i think you're awesome yeah that's tough that's why we all end up inevitably saying something stupid when you're trying to sound intelligent at least once you repeat words yeah next character not going to be good no tired of this moral compass shit (laughter) that's our favorite let's do you in the back with the gilmore shirt on yeah you audience did you guys hear that the question is do we-- yeah 5th edition brought in the backgrounds which i thought was really cool and interesting especially for people who aren't as readily familiar with jumping in and role playing and coming up with a fully fleshed out backstory for someone so i think that was really cool to help people get inspired in that way that they brought in 5th edition what these guys said you're pointing at us yeah i mean you kind of took mine yeah each game that we see where someone's like we're playing for the first time because of you guys it's like this little victory and i mean it's so overwhelming every time like there's a reason why laura and i cry every time at critmas because it's overwhelming because you get all these letters about people saying-- i honestly believe that playing keyleth for four or five years now-- how long i don't know however long we've been doing this-- almost five years has made me a more empathetic and better person i don't know if i was someone who inherently tried to think about other people first before keyleth now she's putting myself in her shoes i genuinely think because you always learn more when you walk a mile in someone else's shoes you get that perspective so i think rolling someone who is just trying to do the best-- the most beneficial good positive choice every time even though there might not be one is interesting thank you sorry i dropped it on the floor you're very resourceful travis you're probably our best strategist you just unfortunately play a stupid character (laughter) yeah totally dude that means you've made it that's like a-- dude you're not web-famous until you're like sad keanu or like that facebook that just posts the same picture of tobey maguire crying every day half-elf druid bitches half-elf no i don't know i have been a half-elf and a druid for a very long time so it's hard to say what's going to be more my favorite dwarves are pretty dope (swedish dwarf impression) welcome to the city of kraghammer oh we know paladins have a thing they're like rally rabble rabble rabble don't warcraft paladins kind of have a same thing too where they can be like (rally cry) what's that called audience oh it's diablo you know what i can't keep all of my paladins straight you guys let's go you right in front in the duck hat audience you have to be really clever she has one what are you serious exactly i can control weather thank you guys bye oh i love those guys vic oh hi how are you your shirt is badass can we talk for a second about-- you look like you're ready to adventure right now like your armor is ready to be thrown on how are you this is the con where people just come in and they're like hey guys just thought i'd come by your panel you just missed them see you later vic matt and definitely i smell like him now all right next question yeah you had one right you were going to go next audience i thought it was going to be a one-shot was not supposed to last for five years i was like i never play good insecure people i should do that just once yeah and i always to reiterate that when we first started our game-- because we'd already been playing for about two years before we turned the camera on-- our first game was just that it was silly it was crazy i remember laura took to it she had never played before she took to it like a fish to water she gets in and she's like (vex impression) all right lads come on let's get in here let's go kill something i remember liam and travis being like what what's going on why are they talking like-- i remember travis being like you have an accent do i have to have a british accent does everyone have to have a british accent (laughter) it is going to be a really good book ashari is a background we made ashari a background i can think of an ashari warlock background right now maybe you're a fire ashari and grew up in the city of brass and then you stumbled upon the rift in the plane the split between our realm and theirs and then you ended up just becoming a part of the ashari tribe and living amongst them because you appreciated them and you were a warlock first you could be a warlock ashari you could do it he does maybe two three voiceover sessions a day comes home goes in his office writes wake up do it again this has been for six nine months almost done though he basically had a green bigby's hand right here audience also if anyone is not aware we have a little sideshow on geek & sundry called gm tips and you've done the first several then we're going to switch to a different gm because you can only learn so much from one teacher right guys other people have different perspectives we're going to switch it up soon so be on the lookout for that the gm tips is really good for anyone they're five-minute episodes matt's a writer he writes for videogames he works for turtle rock a lot he wrote evolve a lot of the dialogue and stuff for evolve so he knows what he's talking about he's a good source from a player standpoint to answer your question some of the stuff that started really blowing our minds was when the terrain started coming into place the fight in the underdark where if you stood in one place and didn't move on your turn then the undead hands would reach up and start pulling you underground that was what started really messing with us when there were environmental situations that started coming into play because that doesn't always have to be a bad guy matt you tend to do a lot of guys in waves which is interesting because especially as a player you're like these two bastards all right bam bam bam bam all right we only took one hit-- aw three more are coming (groans) (laughter) i feel like it's always there are bad things in tiny packages you notice it's always the tiny enemies that you underestimate like what was that little brain dude with legs that kept zapping grog's intelligence what were those called no they were like mind sucker things brain devourer yes man those guys it's dumb (laughter) i know it's kismet because we've gotten lucky in several battles where we should have all died so i'll take doors i'll take that as an exchange let's see you also doing the bigby's hand to him yeah you audience yeah audience that's a great question favorite town/city man any of the towns in the feywild are always crazy and awesome yeah what was it called but syngorn's not based in the feywild just the feywild in general was cool invaded it and then killed them all (laughter) that moment when you realize vox machina's just a fascist regime in the feywild they were being dicks that's true city of brass was awesome ank'harel was incredible that's all you that's not necessarily d&d city of brass is d&d what's your favorite city i want to call my period the lady of pain (laughter applause) you pick it yeah you in the how do you want to do this shirt sorry audience hang on i'm sure i have one favorite and least favorite character someone that's there's got to be-- it's uncanny we're not making that shit up you guys i've never seen anything like that he breaks math he breaks the law of averages i spent my doctorate on this man least favorite is so hard because even the people that you get frustrated with or that you don't like it doesn't mean that they're bad characters generally everyone is so fleshed out and thorough-- no i'm being serious in game i've had altercations with kima but she's probably one of my favorite characters raishan was keyleth's arch-enemy but also one of my favorite villains that we've had to date even though she was frustrating because you never knew what she'd say if it was true or not yeah it's good it's tough i like things that break the meta-narrative i don't believe that there is a 100% good vs evil metric system that's why i love anti-heroes so much and i love characters that break that formula i feel like most of our characters in the game do not everyone's great and not everyone's horrible either everyone has their motives that's what's always important everyone has their motives some of my favorites i'm really partial to allura but i think it's because keyleth is starting to look to her as a mentor as an example of leadership and who she wants to become so yeah allura is great we've had some good moments me and allura yeah good times me and a me and allie that's true sorry it's jam town over there [offscreen singing and laughter] audience if only i had a nickel yeah you you've been enthusiastic yeah what's up audience hey dm in the house audience (accented) was that north country (accented) oh west country oh (laughter and applause) oh yeah i want to go insane so bad what's that one where you're basically an anime character yeah all right let's see let's do you with the overwatch hat yeah you audience that's okay hi oh you're like a samurai audience i know eberron's a popular campaign that's old-school cows i will never forget that until the day i die nothing will beat flying cows then using ourselves as cows as living bait then chasing down somebody still as cows that was great (mooing) you could honestly lead this conversation with anything sam does yeah i feel like good stuff always comes-- the spa when we were in the spa in the mansion and we did the cannonball contest that was awesome that was fun i like when we use our enormous power and strength for petty competitions just great yeah we're just a bunch of kids and colville dmed for you not long ago yeah for me you and liam matt and fryda wolff the female lead voice in the new mass effect andromeda who hadn't booked that at the time we were happy to hear she got that as i always say it's your world we're just playing in it let's go in the back for the people who are far in the back you the guy who's got the devil horns up who i can't see really yeah you hi audience that's weird keep going audience the question was about giving cities texture beyond a pub you do such a good job i feel like we throw curveballs at you and you always have an answer like when we were like what's the main underground market here you're always like i mean drugs we're like how did you-- you already knew that you seem to always know the underbelly of the city as well weapons like victor what about when we went to draconia the lead ravenite's name what was her name audience tooma was she made up damn it never mind forget i said anything really yeah i will say this isn't really spoiler-y i felt a little bad when we were like let's go to the earth ashari this past episode i could immediately see you being like yeah okay uh-huh okay oh you're going to go over okay you guys do that for a second sure (singing) scanlan bigby's hand audience we used to do back before we streamed we would pull 12-hour d&d days and we would get together around 10am and we would always start with a nice brunch and mimosas so great bagels some yogurt smoked salmon and mimosas then you play d&d all day it's the best let's do yeah you in the red dress yeah you audience it's on a lake audience i'd say yes i think when you're playing a character-- we're in these characters for generally four hours a week it's hard to not let a little bit of that real-world influence bleed occasionally yeah that's from a dm stand i'm sure as a player i know-- my therapist actually is fascinated with the game and the way that sometimes the game will mirror our real lives unintentionally for example my therapist here recently has been fascinated by the idea as i've slowly taken on leadership positions at geek and sundry and she's fascinated that keyleth is slowly coming into herself as a leader as she's completing her aramente so my therapist is like holy shit tell me more about your d&d game i'm a psych major and this is insane i'm like i know i don't think it's any secret that liam had a really dark time last year with his mom and problems in his family with her being sick i think it was definitely a stage that it could be worked out on it's hard to not let those dark thoughts bleed sometimes it's never intentional if anyone hasn't seen the it crowd-- by the way i noticed your shirt earlier-- there's an amazing episode of the it crowd where they play d&d and roy has just gone through a breakup and he's working out that his girlfriend that he recently broke up with didn't really say goodbye and he was left without closure so he gets that closure in the game there are two great episodes i feel in modern sitcom history that do a good job at showing what d&d is succinctly and that's the community episode of d&d and the it crowd episode of d&d and i think they show them differently for both ways the it crowd version shows that therapeutic element it's also why i'm a massive believer in d&d being used in elementary schools and middle schools and kids who might have social issues and kids who might be more on the spectrum and leaning towards autism because it gives them a stage and an acceptable closed basically mock-reality situation where they can try their social techniques and use social dynamics without real-world consequences and i think that speaks volumes one of the amazing things harkening back to a way earlier question about what are the benefits of bringing the show onto the internet is i've talked to so many educators and teachers and librarians who are now bringing d&d and d&d clubs to the schools and for kids who might have more social problems and the stories that come back are breathtaking and awe-inspiring of these kids finding themselves and practicing just practicing without judgment from the real world and i love d&d for that reason (applause) keyleth audience it's generally not intentional same thing it takes practice i think getting through that boundary of nope keyleth doesn't know that i know that keyleth doesn't know that it takes practice and it's the same reason why every single one of us at one point in time over the 85 episodes we've been streaming have gone i say this-- nope i'm not there i'm not there shit sorry and it's never intentional i hope everyone understands that just as much as everyone else can get caught up in the story so can we and it's so easy to be like i-- shit i'm at a pub i'm not even there never mind never mind it's weird the way the word metagaming has become so vilified since we've started for a while you thought the m-word was almost as bad as the g-word holy shit i'm sorry i didn't know people are taking this personally and if you look inward at yourself you've probably done it too in your game by accident i say try to be cool be aware of it yeah let's do you since we're not sure which the fingers were all pointing audience what caused him to start creating exandria and when did he feel comfortable revealing it let's do you in the plaid yeah audience don't you have an episode of gm tips that's about making encounters more difficult without just giving them more hit points and like what we were saying earlier an enemy that does 12 hit points that sucks it sucks way more if there's pools of lava that are lapping up next to us and we might get hit into the lava at any point by this guy literally like vax dimension dooring with his cloak and then pulling a lever which almost led us all to our doom (laughs sarcastically) he still feels bad about that one i'm going to save you guys acid starts filling up the room thanks vax thanks buddy like face-planting in lava nothing's worse than being like i'm coming to save you (grunting) nothing's worse than that i'm going to be a hero-- and we're signing from 730 to 930 offscreen we can go a little bit over i just have to pee at some point soon matt and oh there's a panel here at 700 okay we'll do a couple more questions okay yes you with the curly hair yeah audience it's so awesome every time i remember-- and i feel like people forget about it a lot but we totally avoided an entire encounter when we were going into the fire plane and then i turned into a fire elemental and used my ignan language to be like i'm bigger and better than you go back to where you came from and they were like yeah okay and walked away we avoided an entire encounter with a bunch of fire elementals by doing that that was dope unless they're feebleminded (laughter and applause) (coughs) ripley (coughs) we fell for every bait following percy all right let's do you with the peach phone that you're holding up audience everyone's sick man it's going around audience 2nd-level spells technically every time i do a grasping vine i should only be able to do a cantrip but that would be lame so we do grasping vine and i can do a 2nd-level or lower we're at level 17 now most of us yeah so we're pretty beefy i know that's another thing that's ended up happening but when we started the stream we were level seven or level eight but now there's been a decent amount of new people who have come in and been like jesus christ they're fighting pit fiends yeah we're pretty beefy at that point
