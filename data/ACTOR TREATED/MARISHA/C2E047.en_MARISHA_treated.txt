yes make sure there's no titties you can't show nips nope this is fine yes it is that's totally ciri there you go work it that's the point of all of this 22 ooh okay okay what are we doing what's happening do you want to flank and we can kind of peek in do a little scouting the crustacean things okay yeah let's do that nott and i will get in position flank the door and hold our attacks in case something runs out yeah go ahead and use my bonus right and then hold my action right so i'll do that and use a ki point none of us can really see (slamming) natural one (laughs) happy 2019 i turn to the group and i go one's coming your way jeez louise oh and i get to add a d4 from being blessed okay 11 still not good miss yep my armor class is 19 bracers oh thank you gil 21 plus a four from bless so 25 ugh no i'm not into that no is that all of us are we done being stunned you killed him it's okay it's okay it's okay someone hit it thank god did my stun wear off i might as well it would go to waste anyway right i'm going to have two on me plus seven 24 plus another four with bless that i didn't do that's a regular old off-hand attack right i think i'm still good six damage plus a d4 plus another three so 17 both times 22 14 so sorry i'm so sorry i haven't gone i'm still grappled by both of them though mm-hmm that sounds like a waste of beau's time she is holding on going to start swinging wildly from where she is she's going to hit the-- smoke bombs don't affect their grip the one that got phantasmaled okay plus seven jesus 23 no it's a one what else can i do is there anything else i can fucking do here okay i mean i can do it on my-- but i still get a second attack here okay 18 plus one 19 same one that's good nine damage i'm going to spend a ki point to do stunning strike for the love of god stunned i'm going to do my bonus does patient defense matter if i'm grappled okay copy yeah i'll do patient defense i'll look at the other one and grab his claws and stare him in the eye does it move out of my range did he hop out of my melee range pop pop sentinel well natural one doesn't-- and a natural 20 no i rolled a natural one yeah i rolled a nat one and a nat 20 so he moves i'm still alive i'm doing all right everyone's at such a loss i thought he had his little moment with the little quick goblin sam and you said you used the initiative of the one that died by accident it was coming up on this turn it's all on one round was what you said because i tried to do sentinel on it okay dope i'm going to do a kick off the ocean floor and i'm going to jump i want to do an aerial over the two of them to land towards fjord as i'm upside down in the air i'm going to take my two attacks so dope i'm going to go for the one that's not stunned first come on that's good that's a 17 i really need to do math better 22 plus 25 yeah and then i'm going to try and stun him oh nine jester sees an arc of my blood through the water as i'm bleeding and i cartwheel second attack i'm going to go to the one that's already stunned this is just a straight roll right i've been using my fists as magical wow cool real cool story double that to a nice awesome two six my crit was less than my-- thank you and flurry of beaus one more time pop pop i'll do the furthest one wow that's not cool 13 plus-- give me a four 16 thank you bless okay that would have been awesome with that critical ten damage second attack same thing wait no hang on six plus seven so 13-- yes 17 it went in between my dice 17 six damage yeah sweet molasses okay this could be awesome mm-hmm right behind fjord yep thank you okay you want me to see if i can punch this guy first okay i'm going to take my staff for this one i'm going to between fjord go excuse me see if i can get it get get on oh my god why does this always happen to me yeah that's pretty good though 21 okay that's 18 plus two so 20 no for the disadvantage first attack right disadvantage so the first one is six damage no sorry seven damage three plus four then the next one is missing definitely missing with a two yeah i guess i'll just punch it one more time yeah through the crowd grabbing its hair jesus i don't think that's going to do it either unless-- 14 yeah fucking one-handed bandit does this look bad sam and i would like to go in and find a little bed of seaweed and lay down for a minute is anybody against a short rest i'm pretty tapped on ki points and-- -- blood that's old business we've seen that one are you doing your thing no copy they're this big yeah i have a weird question because you became a champion after-- well you became a champion and avantika was a champion when avantika died someone else become the champion ball two he got one ball we put in one ball we got another ball he has two balls and we're about to put another ball in there i'm about to do that yeah the feather was-- caleb are you going to identify these things well the glass sphere makes me nervous i feel like i heard of things like this before can i get a closer look at the skeleton with the armor to see if the armor looks identifiable no iconography no identifying symbols don't fail me now okay 23 that's a good point my brain went super elaborate and thought that this chamber crushes people if you fuck it up that makes way more sense oh man reverse cowgirl death while all that was happening i was picking up some platinum and gold that i found-- combing the silt and i've got the armor good luck captain i look at the runes in the armor that i'm holding i'll wait 21 just the three of us yeah so how do you feel like durian fruit they smell like rotten flesh when you open them do you like durian as a first mate do i get a dope first mate kit like a spyglass can i use the spyglass oh i absolutely (whoosh) and then yes argh just straight perception okay okay okay wait what this literally happens to me so much that's better 21 and you said they weren't flying colors okay i turn around to fjord relay that message say they've got gunports they're about to fire i'm so happy it's a ship fight i'm getting emotional i thought-- was she the boatswain i don't know who did the ropes and the sails wait i have this written down no you're a carpenter the boatswain was caduceus at least it was oh because you're the master gunner i see hang on we're digesting sam and so we can do two of these right that's what you just said and the master gunner-- it's legit a minigame it's pillars of eternity you guys so the captain the first mate and the boatswain each have access to two special action options described below options full speed ahead and fire at will and then the master gunner has access to the pack the good powder special action can we do each of these actions on our turns or one of these actions a round you said run i think run's a good idea i think they wouldn't be here if we didn't have something that they want do you want to roll initiative then 14 you want to do a hard 45-degree turn if we do that if we turn starboard side we can try and hit them with our starboard cannons if i remember you could do a few different things you could whirlpool-- fire they might just be pirates we're thousands of miles away from fucking wildemount captain i would like to point out the more people we have to bring on board the more people we have to feed or if we don't have enough food-- taliesin and we have enough food all right sticking with it sorry they're pirates i have a feeling darktow would side with these people-- you've gotten good at those right this way good levar work it work it work the gangplank (laughter) would i know that as first mate no for supplies i hand caleb the leather armor as well mm-hmm 31 silver 323 i would like to point out that maybe we should set a little bit aside to-- -- pay the crew everyone took a second to be like-- well i don't know i can't speak for caleb the other empire kid-- huh he's busy i'm from kamordah according to the information they came all the way here to felderwin which is where nott is from my concern was that they mentioned that they used mountain passages if you took this mountain passage all the way through felderwin you would go along this route my concern was that you could easily go east in that path and hit kamordah i don't know i have no desire to go rushing back to my hometown i think i'd prefer to go back to zadash and check in personally what are we going to do to stop an invading army i don't know i honestly don't even know if they'd believe me if i told them to run so what's the point maybe we could better organize our efforts together in a larger city like zadash or go check in on nott's family first actually i got a note from my parents when i was at the cobalt reserve at the cobalt soul it seemed very clear that they didn't really want me to come back my mother actually ended up birthing a son while i was at the monastery so they got what they wanted got rid of me and thought that it would be best if we all parted ways i took that letter as a goodbye and decided to continue on my way i have a baby brother that i've never met nope i don't know i guess i never thought about it like that i never met the kid it's hard to feel concern about something you have no real personal connection with whether they're your blood or not i don't know yeah i guess he could be okay i don't know anyway what about you nott are you here yeah i think so should we go check in in felderwin interesting point though we forged papers for the mistake correct do we have papers for the balleater yet travis and ownership slips might want to make some more-- you made the first one pretty good we'll touch on nicodranas forge some papers check in with mom from there head towards felderwin what exactly happened down there by the way are you afraid are you in the slightest bit concerned that uk'otoa might start speaking to you and putting more ideas in your head hey what does your falchion look like still have the eyeball in it is that still there cool that was my favorite part it would've been sad if it went away we're going to go check in on felderwin time might be on our side going off of jester's point a hundred years can sometimes seem like five minutes for these godly-type beings maybe he'll be content for a while can it change colors what's the other thing you're keeping a rock thing what's a lucky rock do does it allow you to reroll things like the lucky feat said not as beau just as marisha so what's it let you do not generally i like full range of movement in many things that i do oh fuck that would be great to have everyone else can do that already that's what it is it's studded leather pretty much everyone can disguise themselves i was thirsty for 23 hours yeah that's legal yeah did you learn how to do that from him i tell jester this my parents when they were trying to form me into a functional member of society thought it would be a good idea if i got into jewelry making so i have a jeweler's kit i could crush gems yeah just throwing that out there just a light divination i would like to go to caleb really quick and be like hey did you happen to finish that copy of avantika's code for me can i get it thanks yep i go to my chambers and for the rest of the time i want to try and memorize her code okay at some point in time like halfway through i go back to caleb after 24 hours with it i was like okay i'm trying to memorize this i figured it might be useful because you know this code you memorized this code you have a photographic memory i figure if we're ever in trouble we can write messages in this code not too many people know it yeah i've been doing that (hesitating) will you help me tutor me it might go a little faster okay i do
