yes oh that's cool he did it nothing taliesin didn't you say you ran into a critter who went and started to do d&d i love that so thank you travis and if he can do it you can too so cute it could have been so many things big money jewels and you're sure he's a god yeah i'm really interested in a god that kicks it with people travis and i've never heard of that maybe molly can do a seance and he'll come out does he talk back we were in alfield because that was also when i stole the mail room party why not you could also get a new jacket and new pants how long could it take you to memorize pockets on a coat that's like 20 minutes you could really just get a new coat she does see hamster unicorns are they gods so we're not having this room party you also have to get in in order to rent the room caleb why are you so hung up on just changing clothes for like ten minutes just to get through the door i'm just saying you want in dress for what you want well why don't we at least go and talk to that guard that came back try and track him down maybe get a little bit of insight do we know where that guy is oh or was there a guy that came back i mean it will be dark after that oh yeah let's drink and fight that's a good idea let's maybe stock up on some torches on the way there nah we don't need torches do we not anymore yeah i have one in my adventurer's kit yeah copy two sponge rollers all right oh good they came to us what all right here's what we're doing we got this whole writ thing from the lawmaster we're going to go down kill the monster that's been tormenting you guys heard you lost a few guards heard any rumors do you know anything before we go down there and maybe die uh-huh come on man i'm not-- why-- did i ever ask you to come with us i just asked for rumors man don't put words in my mouth open the-- what did you hear stop with the nervous tics stop i know that that's still not information on the monster is there a way to navigate the sewer systems any markings we should look out for nothing about what kind of monster it is no darkness tentacles big teeth can i do a look around to see if there are any types of street marking for the sewers natural 18 22 i believe 22 so one two three type of a thing what about the arrow to the left this arrow splits into three arrows and then-- and it's a penis right yeah also there's got to be an a and b around here all right i guess there are more options this way or down deeper i mean it is a sewer system or it could just be the main drainage out of the city all right i wrote down blockage webbing and nest how big are those slide marks yasha four inches there are people eating at home right now the water seems to be moving towards the direction we're going go back the other way that's true the middle is the safest i'll take the front with yasha i'm assuming putting my goggles on poop-mist (squeaking) i take a ball bearing-- i'm going to take a ball bearing and ping it it's a hairball it's like resin it's reality seeping into our game a little bit i know it's so baldur's gate i love it 19 (chanting) level three nine not fun (groaning) natural one oh sorry hang on i'm taking damage one two three-- apply damage i'm going to take this one that is in between closest to me and yasha and i'm going to do a big ol' golf swing with my quarterstaff not that dice you were mean to me ooh that's good 22 to hit oh no that's a four i thought that was a one for a second eight damage interesting i still have my other attack yeah can i move in and kick that guy yeah that one i'm going to rat kick rat kick natural 20 come on give me that big ol' four-- that's a one six damage i reach over to yasha and i go-- punch it miss oh no i got it god aw too helpful you're being too helpful it rolled a natural one again laura put it in jail (whimpering) i know okay i'm all right i'm only down five hit points can i bend down and covering with my vest a little bit see if i can search and figure out exactly what these things are made out of guys i think these are undead rats zombie rats it's the egg sack you're totally right that's true it doesn't appear to be human-sized that one does not would it move the webbing as it went through i agree with fjord i think we we start poking around that thing's going to come running oh no that was caleb who was freaked out by fire yeah yeah probably let's burn it i guess i'll go with team caleb/yasha i'm trying to split up evenly you still have your torch yeah do they have a dog tag what okay you stay there with the halfling i might be able to negotiate my way a little further oh jeez louise i'm going to also move forward next to caleb i've got dope goggles though natural 20 i think these goggles are like polarized it's real cool he's got a thick band of tattoos sorry of the halfling do they look old or like a fresher tattoo i did roll a natural 20 they're not fresh do i see puncture wounds okay halfling why are we invisible oh oh goddamn it he has it this whole time i'm sorry then ten to 15 i'm 13 does anyone know where the lollipop is the spider is in between fjord and beau how many do you want to go first is there a way i can hop over the web situation it was bothering me this whole time too i meant to fix it in the break can i jump this gap where molly is and avoid the webbing natural 20 so i have 25 more feet how close can i get to the spider fuck i don't have any reach with my stick i will hold i will take a dodge action you've got this no okay where's it going to go i'm going to-- i'm going to split the difference and go here i'm not i'm going there because i still want to be able to get to it i'm going to hold a flurry of-- can i hold a ki point action or can i hold an attack or can i hold an attack and then decide i want it to be a flurry of blows can i take the bonus attack now to do the ki point and hold it okay this is balls y'all i'll hold until i see it to make an attack i know (electric guitar sounds) you didn't have that did you you couldn't do that type of shit damn it ugh can i close the gap with my 40 foot movement matt and can i-- like i'm trying to get spiders out of the corner ceiling with a broomstick exactly of course i do i'm going to do the full-- i'm like wasp get the wasp disadvantage i got it i did i rolled a 15 and a 17 so that's 21 better call an exterminator 11 do i have room to still get one more swat probably not okay yeah i guess so i turn around and go don't worry guys i got it good ol' broomstick trick works every time i'll still stick with jester though just in case he's-- what

emotions on my face yeah thank you i'm trying to get better at it yeah what do you think in my experience it doesn't matter if he thinks he's fucking with the empire or not the empire is going to look
