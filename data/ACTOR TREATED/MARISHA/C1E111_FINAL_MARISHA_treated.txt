also clarification speaking of saying things prematurely before i should have i've gotten a lot of questions being like what happened to that plan of rolling out one a day once a week yeah that plan didn't turn out to be feasible and i might have said that-- i said it and then i looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward but do not announce this part which why was it even on our announcement sheet still my fault oh shit anyway it's never going to happen because they're easier to do in batch so ten at a time that's what you get it's just better to do them in a block the digital issue the first issue releases digitally this coming wednesday because you don't read your emails they get your unbridled reaction i love atlanta australia is that when we got caught with having to have those weird travel visas as well yeah we didn't know until we got to the airport and then they're like you have to have one and then we're like oh okay luckily you can do it online do we need to do a switchery-poo of our items we just stopped right you dug things out (whoosh) me that's going to be a reddit thread later that's what we're doing while they do that we're timing the steps out ugh 15 it also saves me a 6th-level spell so you know the first and last letter of the alphabet don't worry about it save a life check a sconce do we have any idea how far we've climbed hey natural 20 that's a gil 20 okay all right nipple level the heartburn region a little acid reflux he has acid resistance against reflux called it this is a fucking incinerator i knew it this feels like an incinerator no what he's looking at me-- (nervous laughter) or lasers laser incinerator duh is it curved no the whole room isn't curved it's a square room wait before we do that can i reach some of the ashy stuff hand me some ash i'll test it okay i do a nature check what does this ash feel like it's made out of yeah that's what i'm wondering (groans) oh man that's a one thanks gil i blame gil for his natural 20 in the balance of the universe and maybe it'll open again if i was the person who designed this why would i put a failsafe in here i feel like there's got to be another entrance because we can see another room right no i know that but a lot of things have reflections i go up to the mirror and check it out it's cooled off enough right where were they i walk over and i heat them with my heat hands a fire elemental well when i'm a fire elemental can i do it right now yeah i just took a short rest so yes i can do that so what's the end goal what am i doing but what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols yeah if i touch the symbol there's nothing there right it's just a wall i do a quick gust cantrip hang on i've got a paper ready i take my mantle and start doing a-- i love that we all did something similar but all wrote something different we're like numbers somewhere did you help us or are you just saying almost i think this is right i think you have this i think i have the right part of this and you have the right part of this i'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on the mirror grog draws boobs on himself in the reflection out of the ash it's this tell him to do this i told you there was a room behind the mirror guys it took 111 episodes but we bested a door can you see through it so it's a big 180 going right up did you fuck the roll too oh what the fuck we are following behind i still have my hands guiding percy our blind human (laughs) where's steven i think we're in the lungs i think we're in its chest cavity i can get that i'm interested well if it's on the way we have to go that way can i see any stairs carved in the side in the walls trying to head up to this-- is that what you just checked what about the temple why are your titanstone knuckles exalted yet are they buzzing more step two steps closer do they appear to be buzzing more yeah but as we've already seen from the other tomb it's already been heavily heavily plundered how far away is the temple do we know can we football range guess it hang on how long have we been in here versus how far have we been from vasselheim because we are on a time crunch super fucking fast i just want to say we gave you guys the other temple in which you found your stupid waistband but we got really fucked up from it everything has a consequence and a price and shit nothing is free let me do it i have pass without a trace and one more 2nd-level spell left i'll do it save yours how about this hold wait we still don't know how to get up there right yeah do you like it thank you it's a little metallic thank you i bought it while i was waiting for-- travis and okay i hate to say split the party but what if we split the party what if a few of you check out your fucking temple and then the rest of us try to figure out a way to get up temple party who else is on temple party so wait just the two of you are going to go check out the carpet okay so grog-- okay cool i'm on board 26 are you serious we're trying to go up right so it's like 28 days later zombies he said that they were fast just wanted to make sure they weren't special and we still have pass without a trace so let's go yes i didn't do anything keeping that concentration taliesin and yeah it's a very small amount yeah it's dried i spent that time i spent time during the break be a distraction how far away can he be though i've been very conservative with what i've been doing for a reason i agree with grog we can't sacrifice having him gain all of those followers because then the only option would be murder a lot of his followers which i'm not really comfortable with i want to go on record and say i think this is stupid okay let's go i have to come with you because i have the pass without a trace spell wait up we argued more this game more than anything else okay we know we still have to fly upwards including on flying up to the blue crystally thing right well then what the fuck we fucking fly i can burn a spell we're probably going to take another short rest right okay you're on me and you're on carpet and you're on broom giant eagle not yet though okay why didn't you tell us that before by the way they're all staring right at you they're 100 percent aware of what's going on what happens so we hope nothing happened to them when we put it in the bag of holding they were like (groaning) and kept going all the undead are we flying i have keen sight does that count oh shitty and shittier 28 i have a plus 13 plus advantage i take the lead i guess (caws) you said things or people is this a body-sized hole how is it lining up towards the steps of the giant much quicker so it's very slow but not as slow as the rate he's walking i'm not against this idea it's like that dress you bought four years ago you still haven't worn it might find a purpose wait there's not a hole that we can go up it's a barricade it's like steel rebar in front of the door that's what i was going to say is it a water chute drainage is this a drain pipe does there appear to be any other type of chutes coming into this room i'll be with you yeah i'm right behind you man i'm at the ready for whatever i've got the other one so i'll be second keyleth in front of grog samesies so it looks like a landing no if you're going to take a quick glance then we have to bust them open like a proper rpg i'd imagine because he's vertical now instead of horizontal oh so they're cultists little bit of that reach around viskon we've heard the name viskon before odell comma tell viskon we have visitors wait when did we hear odell before don't let them leave i agree with that did everyone roll shittily 15 what's up bro get it get it son you have that guy but this guy was the runner i thought okay he's currently grasped between him and grog him and the other guy or just between him how big is it fucking fuckface yeah it just might hurt don't let them leave who looks like he's controlling it odell (yells) oh my god so much has changed from what i thought i was going to do yeah so i come up from the staircase okay i'm going to come up i'm trying to think of what i have in range and i'm terrified and i'm going to stick with my original instinct and do wall of stone and try and wall these guys in so they can't run i think they can still carve through it with their big black death orb now okay i can do ten ten-foot by ten-foot panels so i want to be a semicircle block off bring up a whole wall of stone behind them i do have dispel magic can't cast through it even though it's a nature thing going up underneath there i can't get around it no (singing) i'll see you on the other side of the wall (laughter) wraiths hey was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil vax and keyleth i look over my shoulder and go oh no misses that's right i leveled up motherfuckers but i feated so i'm good war caster does it have to be a bonus action sorry i'm trying to figure out what would be a good idea right now i have never done this before but i have it learned i will ice knife it in its face ice knife level one you create a shard of ice fling it at-- oh it's a flingy-thingy but it's 1d10 piercing damage and then it explodes no hit or miss the shard then explodes the target and each creature within five feet of the point where the ice explodes oh i'm fine i'm doing it anyway what's wrong with us one yeah 2d6 technically reroll ones three four five six seven yeah each creature hit or miss the shard then explodes i hate this force field shit wisdom and death plus what beautiful you didn't get through (screams in frustration) whose turn is it get the runner he went that way we've got to take out these guys' eyeballs it's not good for you but it's good for us fuck them up you're confusing entanglement with grasping vine two totally different things okay seeing grog slam into that ugh fuck this is a pretty beefy spell yeah force wall should i do fifth or sixth level to dispel this okay fifth or sixth level sixth level i'm going to dispel magic this wall higher than sixth level the spell okay it's higher than seventh level did you have to roll i don't know now you guys i move forward i guess i don't want to move that far forward no i don't move that far forward (laughter) (singing) i want you to be alive laura and yeah i'm going to pull out my staff and do a burning hands on him dexterity saving throw half damage and then there's a third one that is a six was that right six and six is 12 so 16 i can't believe i couldn't fucking dispel that wall that was how i lost to grog in our battle sanctuary you shall not pass keep them from running away this is all on you man this is all on you that's a good call kill him oh it's fine there are tunnels collapsing and shit it's fine i'm not concerned about the noise at the moment okay i run up as far as i can 30 feet do i see this motherfucker or i see the glimmering of bigby's hand fireball (laughter) what the fuckballs does he magical 29 points of damage he's still going after my ass you beat me to it man keyleth goes up to the red robe vax can i borrow a dagger i take it and i stab it in his other eye red robe guy how many of those symbols do we still have and how many robes do we still have the guy that i'm standing over red robe i'm going to rip his necklace off so they were holding on to that orb the whole time yeah he didn't cast it though we didn't see him cast that yeah grasping vine yeah move away wait keyleth stares with a vague familiarity yeah he knew river through that but if he cores out a tunnel for us we can carry scanlan like on a palanquin like we are the champions fuck these guys we got all their shit let's go they can lie what is it might as well okay hang on though what are we going to get from this guy i'm going to go pee you guys everyone looks upset how much a lot oh that's a lot yeah throw them down the well oh yeah i feel like i always come back from the bathroom right as we're ending games our comic on wednesday
