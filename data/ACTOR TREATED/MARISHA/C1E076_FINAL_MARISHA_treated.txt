roll what is he coming for me that looks like that's what's happening i tried to make him stupid and i'm sure he realizes that technically i thought you couldn't cast-- i thought it doesn't work with spells i don't know sam and thought you couldn't just cast two spells it was only melee attacks-- aw thanks man i wouldn't understand half of those references i love whipped cream it's delicious thanks scanlan talk to the hand doesn't she have an evil thing an anti-evil-people-thing no but there's a radius blast thing (whimpering) okay oh that's not bad 21 oh my god okay my water sphere is still over there well shit i'm going to drop the watery sphere i'm going to try and earthbind this motherfucker yep try and get him down fuck that's it he blew my action can i try and back away from his crazy presence i can't see exactly where i am is there a way i can tuck inside the little tower that's right there sure can i move toward them and tuck into this alcove maybe if i move under him he's only 15 feet okay hang on he's only 15 feet okay can i try something he's hovering above this can i as a bonus action cast grasping vine right over here no sorry over here and i want to try and

to me you can see me and grog and that's pretty much it yeah i am thank you oh shit dammit okay do i have any view on big pharma okay is he peeking off like if i shifted around would i be able to see a little i'm going to try and shift toward you to see if i can see him around the lava bend okay can i take my action to go ahead and cast sunbeam and then hold it until i see him that's what i want to do whenever i see him can my sunbeam go through the sphere can i please sunbeam first god dammit scanlan yeah he's probably going to save from that too (lazer zapping) it's a constitution saving throw that's my dc no that's a plus two to spell attack rolls i can't use my-- it's radiant damage and he's not blinded which would have been so cool does he take extra because it's radiant he takes nine points of damage by the way such a troll tonight you got your wish her body just landed at your feet it's like left 4 dead physics heh yeah yep does inspiration help negate all three hit just one oh that's right i've got that at the top of my turn okay first one was 21 second one's 15 third one heh is a natural one okay lucky number seven come on winner winner okay i'm going to sunbeam him

really nervous i still have movement right that's 18 for the first one ooh not good not good at all seven can i use inspiration on that plus 12 another seven so 14 okay and then last one last one 13 i don't know i did i took it as i went and then i erased it holy shit oh jeez he has advantage against spells magic casters have been useless that would have been so great who's close to her do you still have any spells left the poison spell can you drag her in yeah trying to get scanlan yeah it just made you look real cool you will die it doesn't heal but it should fix poison all right i'm going to sunbeam she-ra right in the face just say i'm sorry what's your name well i can fly so can i scooch around that's right for once all right so she's blind that's the cool part that's a good roll okay that's 14 plus seven which is 21 (adding) 29 no no 27 plus four is 21 31 something it's a hollow victory do i still have any more movement 85 flying speed you've got pike i want to can i make it to big pharma i don't remember any of their names i'm just using the nicknames we've come up with ghurrix yeah can i flank him a bit yeah i want to flank i can fly though i can hover can i hover and flank i'll just hover there and look imposing i'll puff up real big are you inside holy shit good teamwork good teamwork pike i thought she was already inside i know what horror have you brought upon us yeah we're starting to-- not like this starting to drop like flies i feel like this is a very strong hint from the dungeon master you've had this by your side the whole time that's real good yeah yeah yeah come on come on come on bard do we try to get in the mansion or what do we do okay can i as part of my speed-- i wasn't that high up i was just hovering above-- can i go down scoop up scanlan and both of us bolt into the mansion vex is right on the outside of the door right on the outside of the door okay i'm going to swoop down and drag her in do i still have an action i drop my elemental form and i cast protection from poison on her thank god i took that but he can carry it right proof you've got to trade it for the dawnmartyr armor is there anything else left of him didn't he have a symbol on his chest or whatever that was a three hour fight woo we didn't die [break] i am up to 80 these boots appear to actually be boots that my people might have made they are boots of spider climbing the wearer can spend an action to cast spider climb on themselves no concentration required the effect lasts for an hour spider climb lets you-- i go to percy he's waving dibs i thought that the guards were going to show up way sooner we lucked out they've got a low response time in this city they're from wildemount you're different too there's a very nice city where we came from might be able to start a new life there we don't need to check back in with senokir he already has a way to get hold of us but we can stealth there get the armor and then get out thank all of us we did this together i have just enough room in my spell bus to take us all back we should probably slave ourselves up again we don't have to go far that is weird i feel like i'm learning so much about you vax we put our chains back on i take out the necklace and throw it at her feet or on the table in front of her if word has not reached you by now honestly i'm quite surprised word of mouth it's a small city i think you've done enough gambling for today would you care if we do a little teleportation spell in your living room right because you've got-- thank you (chanting) put it on legendary weapons that's amazing we got all of our legendary weapons travis and okay let's go home to fort daxio we can come back for him i gave him a bracelet he knows where we are i gave him the bracelet so he knows where to find us as soon as we kill thordak we'll come back and make good on our word well if we go back though what if he wants to cash in right now i gave him the bracelet deliberately yeah remember we're dragging children everywhere we go look he mentioned let me give you a trinket in case you all leave so i can find you again but he's expecting it all right i guess we can talk to him i'm just afraid he'll try and cash in on it right now and not let us leave how far of a walk is it all right what's in the box (laughter) i think we misjudged him if you ever find yourself in the material plane and need a tour guide-- just you know where to find us i gave you that bracelet we have your card we're good yeah we know wait senokir before you do that is it safe for us to teleport out of here you won't mind okay let's go fort daxio yeah we all join hands with the kids it's one big fatty spell me and eight so let's go (teleporting sounds) how long were we gone do you have any rough estimate how long was i out for man oh god yeah how many people did we gather i hope so i hope we didn't put all of our eggs in one basket and then burn the omelet yeah thanks for coming marisha sam and
