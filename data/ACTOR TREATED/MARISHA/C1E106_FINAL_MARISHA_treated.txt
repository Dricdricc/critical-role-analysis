tell them it is more is coming very soon very very soon next batch is coming and check out these awesome dread shirts you guys they're in the store aren't they awesome mr wren i remember when i got those for you when they were still prototypes in a little white box wow maybe that's very self-centered of us now that i think about it we're heading his direction no matter what i speak primordial which was what they used-- correct i have a question didn't one of us have a potion or scroll of language-speaking didn't we have that yeah primordial celestial would be close i would think more close than primordial we're making investigation checks 20 i start looking at the ceiling is there any type of-- what are those the observatory what are those called percy the celestial tell you the stars thing yeah astrolabe you know those big rotating things you can put in the year and the month in the calendar what am i looking for perception check that's good 17 30 total scanlan (yells) scanlan oh right sorry your stories it's your storytelling keep telling the story about the calamity maybe if you talk about vecna some more and what happened (singing) because he's sealed yes come on hashtag blessed come on multiclassing into that rogue now we're badasses now no i'm just saying the difficulties are going to get harder alone i am tome all the timesies how many things can you learn about and do we have any of these yet but we were supposed to ask ioun wait the core trying to look away kid at the back of the classroom the sword of kas okay oh okay the sword of kas if only people knew that sprigs give foundation to the entire tree (whispers) of course bye sprigg vax is that what's going to happen when you leave okay shall we before we go to issylra wait is vasselheim on issylra how close did i recognize the shore-- southwest going towards pyrah okay start there i should be able to tree stride us right there right i think so i burn my 8th-level spell to plane shift us back to sprigg's house 35 years yeah you could have just asked if you wanted to meet brian foster i thought you said college he is on this week's episode of gm tips sprigg's while keyleth chuckles about that a little bit i'm going to look around and find a little piece to remember sprigg by from his house to take with me and then i'll help him check the books once i've grabbed something yours is much better than mine five does this rusty bolt represent sprigg i'll regrow this plant later sprigg we're looking through the books yeah do you think we'll ever have gods in our lives i don't think they fancy us much i don't really fancy them though so i guess that's fair they're allowed that (sighs) me neither you know i felt really guilty about it for a while like something was wrong with me i don't understand why i didn't feel it why i didn't understand i don't think it was until sarenrae and even ioun just now mentioned that we serve that balance and that non-believers are necessary it made me feel like a little bit less of a fuck-up i guess in this whole situation apparently you're a madman a god called you a madman it's kind of a compliment wow apparently i just don't understand why you were still enigmatic after you already told us in front of pelor it's kind of a slap in the face i hope you know my frustration is only out of-- well what you just said i guess wanting something to be mine that i won't have some things you don't get to keep i followed destiny my whole life it wasn't until i got to the end that i realized the whole thing was ironic cheers to the faithless i kind of inhaled a little bit i don't even know where we got these glasses in the story oh god (spluttering) this coffee's been there for a while that was the grain of sand who the fuck are you insight is he fucking lying oh yes 22 they are so cute we definitely sent them in the text thread while he's rambling can keyleth be looking for the nearest big-ass tree any clear path of least resistance natural 19 path of least resistance without traps we need to go i point out the path that way go in vasselheim i look around is there vecna anywhere to be seen he said he couldn't see us when we were in the library aren't you also wanted here right now i did tell the ashari to start alerting the nearby towns i bet whenever he ascended all the clerics felt it we should probably try and use our words as much as possible i'm going to keep looking around make sure no one's tailing us 21 i watch on the side and don't take my eyes off of him is this what he goes through every time his flesh is cold but his heart still beats i kiss him back through the blood (groaning) that's love y'all you did it okay all right let's clean you up we don't even know where to find him though we're running out of time if you want to go do a little bit of footwork and see what it might take to get there i can rest and try and get us there remember you have to find a tuning fork though that is attuned to the specific plane you need a magical vibrating fork that is connected to the vibrating plane of kord right i'm just letting you know the prerequisites so you can ask the right questions just go oh that's true you're right i don't think the timelines match but i could be wrong i'm not there but they were making out like vecna had this sword while we had craven edge right you got a shard (gasps) we used to eat these in the fire ashari all the time these are a rare delicacy good find grog (gasps) i could grow some more oh my god we can have coal bean soup all the time at home you guys these are coal beans they're great there's a little juice running down your gauntlet fermented fermented keyleth goes behind grog and starts cleaning up the beans that he just threw sure no i was just seeming intelligent do we for sure need platinum each trammel is 500 platinum how much do we have wait grog you had it in your original bag of holding how much was written down on our original bag of holding list do you not still have it written down we had 1600 platinum originally we're going to find out is there a place where we could buy bars if we fail he could be coming after them they have no line of defense i have a few scrys that i want to do anyway nope i've got to pop out i'm just wondering if i do any type of large magic if it'll alert him hey what happened to that skull that we got in brimscythe's basement the gem in the eye remember we thought it might be connected we gave it to allura i wonder if it's spying on everything well yeah we could get the skull back because i was just going through my notes my old diary of everything that we've been through-- i have four diaries of everything we've been through it said evil skull in brimscythe's-- 1/21 we found an evil skull in brimscythe's house it may be connected to craven edge and i put stars next to it i don't know that's just what i wrote down a year and a half ago the skull what now okay wait did she say we needed the sword also i think the knight guy that you fought that was super awful was the bloody-- but wasn't he brought back kas the bloody-handed right oh wait he fought-- but maybe he brought kas back and that was the death knight we fought all right i'm going to step outside and scry on allura first allura wait is anybody around nothing's weird and out of the ordinary okay just want to make sure people just punk'd us at sprigg's cabin doesn't mean assassins can't get inside a church okay i'm going okay no she's fine she's safe in emon so is kima they're both safe okay should i do gilmore next is that necessary i can scry on an object right should i do the skull i mean it might just be a lich phylactery or something but tary was still in-- tary we would feel it she's in the bag of colding yeah real quick i still also want to scry on the shorecomb you guys get her set up the sword of kas does he have any weaknesses is that too broad but she might not care right oh sure because he has to do a display to get followers unless the knight was sylas i don't know i guess we'll find out how many times are we going to have to fight this bitch can i scry on her i have three 5th-level spells plus my scrying eye that i haven't used yet yep yeah this is another plane of existence we have to be on the same plane 21 oh god there's no safe place to hide he can see us everywhere we should go what if he comes here what if he comes here to try and find us and he kills all of these people what if we led him here she's alive she's at thar amphala both eyes this time she said it's almost time it's happening soon whatever he's doing it's happening soon and then he spoke to me in my vision he said my name he knows she's alive how many times no i can burn my 9th-level spell and get us there right now but we'll lose the mansion i can sleep and i can plane shift us when we wake up from this mansion seventh we could transport via plants and i found a tree to get us to-- shorebottom go underwater i could also cast water breathing on eight of us yeah but do the things from the water ashari would those help with poison as well the plan then is sleep and then we go to shorecomb and then we go under this volcano to the anvil i can do that to us i can cast water breathing on all of us okay and then through a tree and then there taliesin and with true polymorph
