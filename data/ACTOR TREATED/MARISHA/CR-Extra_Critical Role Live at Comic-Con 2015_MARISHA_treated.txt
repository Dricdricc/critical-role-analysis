ashley what are you doing here i mean everyone's voice actors so we can get that out of the way right yes i guess i first got into tabletop roleplaying in particular with matt matt was actually my first dm six seven years ago approximately and i've had other games i was a part of a buffy the vampire slayer tabletop rpg which was super fun yup it's a good game i was a pyromancer it was awesome i will say though once you have matt it's hard to go back once you go matt you can't go back it works shut up don't judge me travis chris hi how are you i didn't see you oh and it's erika hi you guys yeah it does feel like being the little kid who's like no there's a monster under our bed and everyone was like oh yeah no you're right there totally is a monster kicking it under there and you're like what they see it too and i feel like that's true every time we get a piece of fanart that comes in because i know personally i was afraid-- i was like i hope this story translates i hope what we see they can see but every time we see a piece of fanart or anything like that it's like oh yeah no that's-- yep that's gilmore holy shit they see it too it's kind of like a reality show but we're not putting ourselves through the wringer we're putting our characters through it so it's great i will say-- no you what i was actually going to say was i am actually really impressed at the critters as a whole and the critter nation we had an awesome story that we heard from our friend dani who's a critter i know right hi yeah she came out here and then was talking to another critter and he was like you're in southern california well i know people at disneyland so i can get you passes to disneyland and it was just because they like critical role so you guys are awesome because you guys are taking care of each other and i'm really loving the communities that i'm seeing are being built and the friendships that are being built around this questions q&a yeah is there a mic floating around liam's got it to which i was like remember your party would not take kindly to that i don't think keyleth would be able to take your back on that one shut up oh my god audience i actually still use vaxy-stabby to remember that cause we said vaxstab like backstab so he does vaxstab as rogue vaxstab vex-dex yeah that works i'll buy that for a dollar workshop it i also really like elven names but i'm like i feel that my name should have meaning i don't know why i'll tend to pick a character for keyleth i was like she's an air druid so i'll name her something airy so i'll type in 'air' i'll go to an elven dictionary and i'll type in air it'll pop out all these elven words for air or if my character was angsty i'll put in angsty and it'll pull out all these elven words for angsty and i picked something based on that so i think keyleth was actually originally spelled with a q it was a que-- it meant like a zephyr it meant like a wind so i switched it and renamed it and got keyleth no it means silent but deadly and now we're trademarking it but i would like to point out we didn't even realize that you had done that until a few weeks ago and we were like ah because you were playing elder scrolls online that's what it was i was actually going to say i think one of my most heroic moments was in the same game when pike died and keyleth turned into an eagle and i scooped you up and got you to the temple first was it at the same time that the tower was collapsing oh that was beforehand okay the magic carpet was awesome because we were trying to use it as a parachute and it was essentially a gamble move anyway we were going to be like oh let's be-- exactly we are going to be like those toy gi joes that you throw over your balcony and it doesn't work that's what we thought then we're trying to parachute with a rug and that's when matt's like and you float down slowly because you learn the carpet is magic (singing) i wish you would step back from that ledge my friend at any moment you hear us on the screen being like oh god i'm hyperventilating the adrenaline my heart's racing i'm shaking that's all 100% real we'll actually be like oh we've got to roll oh i dropped it it's awful it's all real it's good ten minutes we've been here the whole time yeah we're having a great time we have a baseball field behind us so that's cool you would be like what are you going to do and if we say uh more than three times then he's like nah we'd go uh uh uh moving on exactly we're their saviors by the way this is essentially a glimpse into our time after the show cuts it's us yelling and being like why did you do that you could have died don't you scare me like that again feel like a protective mom being like slamming on the brakes our time is now audience we brought sleeping bags yeah we'll be here oh ify money talks and bullshit walks
