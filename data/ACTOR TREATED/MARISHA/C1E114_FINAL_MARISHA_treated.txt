it floating like a gravitational state it should still be able to work yeah theoretically 19 yeah the whip is down i love that from his perspective you were like if the whip hits the floor come after us (footsteps) (yelling) (crashing) so it looks like those electro-touchy balls what are those called casualties of war are you in the maze of the abyss you're in the endless maze of the abyss you got to be it's another plane you got something for that right yeah but i think he gets two or three legendary actions per turn did he do a flame strike take it (laughs) take the dark purple moody one or i should have given you a different one oh that heart disease it's the number one killer we're not afraid of this nine i'm sure i'm flushed he's immune to lightning okay thank god i think grog is by vex yeah i'm going to cast my 6th-level bones of the earth it creates six at 120 feet distance five feet wide 30 feet high so i'm going to see where grog is-- oh shit that's right is this useless for me to do right now okay i'm going to scratch that i'm going to scrap that right now i am going to do an 8th-level sunburst right in his face 12d6 he's probably got a stupid constitution no he's taking it he takes 12d6 and he is blinded for a minute but he's got true sight well he takes 12d6 radiant damage which is cool come on big money i am again okay so that's six (counting) that was almost a six my finger fucked it up (counting) 45 points of radiant damage i really hope i didn't kill another kid fuck you (laughter) man i was just starting to get over that first kid not that i would ever get over-- i'm going to use my bonus action to cast a healing word at 2nd-level on myself and then i'm going to take whatever breath i have left and say pike ouch hurting i'm hurting i'm going to move up a bit near trinket behind trinket i want to be close to pike still we've got to get grog back grog has a trammel how can you tell just on the cusp you have to save yourself so you can help us that's so horrible that's not good i'm under 100 hit points i can try and save it in time can i add my inspiration to that saving throw right i have advantage because it's a spell right i have advantage against spell saves intelligence save if he fails the-- i am not a vegetable you sweet sweet man goddamn it he's probably looking at you scanlan you have the book we can't lose you for real war caster come on don't fall to oblivion please jenga come on grog oh no it's okay now becky won't know i was talking shit about her i think it was the weird echo-y sound of ashley's pages turning what do you have what did you forget druid die and don't fuck me gil don't fuck me gil well this one fell off i mean it was a floating three oh no it's a 13 no this isn't good 15 plus my intelligence oh wait my intelligence oh and i'm trained in-- okay wait what did i just say 17 plus eight 25 hang on can i use my inspiration too yeah okay i'm good plus a six 31 i can take it i asked you tell me what to do if it was cocked or not you just stared and went like this you were thinking what would you have claimed liam and i don't want to get targeted later matt i want you to treat me fairly okay i mean on the internet i mean from people being pissed at me on the internet miss hits are you coming back come back come back don't kill j'mon you're going to use two to try and do it percy in the house oh my god already oh my god you're still fucking gone 40 feet then i am going to burn my 9th-level shapechange i'm going to turn into a planetar pulling this ripcord and that's my action right i can move as the planetar okay i'm going to fly my 120 feet move speed and come behind over here-ish but in the air all right a little bit over that's workable yeah i mean i don't think i can do a bonus as a planetar right no we've got to get grog back crit on a 19 oh my god you and the 19s crit on a 19 come on bring him back i think 60 feet we're like an 80s b-level fantasy movie right now oh yeah vlad the impaler him oh my god amazing well you roll and then you double what you roll so roll big come on is it whoa we need to start getting some trammels in him i think y'all are you down are you looking rough yeah it is i get advantage on spell saves right spell save right 21 61 and 71 oh i have resistance against bludgeoning as a planetar no it carries over oh that's magical that was rough and now you can't okay i mean i would want that if i was a god definitely put that on the list you don't crit on a 19 he's beauty pageant crying that's you that's fucking you here's some too how many penises have you seen i'm a flyer so i'm good she's distracted she's like (yells) right now okay in my buff michael fassbender but as a hot chick kind of way i look down and i go grog the gymnast thing whoosh and i swoop down my speed but i'm buff and i'm bigger i'm going to scoop him up if he can do a little jump and whoosh 24 strength okay that's fine i rolled a nine plus seven so 16 going the rest of my movement which you said i used 40 feet 50 so i have another 70 feet of movement can i use my bonus to dash a little further can i because you held your action can i get up there and give him the cheerleader like the figure skater go grog and see if i can do the you know what's the reach on your thing can i have him on my shoulder you know once again like the cheerleader thing ready go okay can you use your chain as a grappling hook i'm sorry it changed the battlefield changed immediately is that the same roll drop it like it's hot if we straight kill him that's no good that's not good i need a full 100 what about you and you need more than a hundred but she has plenty left over percy and sam need more than a hundred you have a trammel right pike are we trying to get all three trammels in in one round i'm afraid he's going to try and yank them out did you have something there's a lot you can do when you're falling that was the worst blue balls ever it gives us a good answer so if we got two in then he would have to save over 20 so he would have to roll a ten or higher we have a 50/50 shot if we get two in him yeah but he can still save from it if he rolls a 16 17 18 19 or 20 50 hit points a round oh wait you already did your action how far away is he now from where we moved so how far away are we now roughly we were up under him a little bit if you want to hold again i can get you up there next if you want to hold your attack action i can get you in melee range this time i can maybe i can do an arc and do a droppy thing on him how epic would that be if they ran back in advantage against spell saves yeah dex 20 resisted so-- 72 so 34 35 thank god we healed we would've all been dead you're feeding me a potion hey babe-- (gagging) you fed me a superior okay 8d4s what constitutes as low 131 why are they all around scanlan percy's there you're not going to kill another of our friends in front of us are you joe don't die gives you wings (singing) the bros are back in town okay still in our synchronised swimming stance i fly up and-- i'm going to drop grog onto vecna and then do my own thing can i give him a little bit of a boost okay oh man it took 114 episodes that we finally have a title name drop in our show it's a critical roll don't forget your blessings okay so after he does that keyletar is going to swing around and find another one of those openings and i'm going to take my greatsword and do my multi-attack and jam it right into one of his openings and open it up a little wider got to get it nice and good okay getting it nice and good okay so first attack-- opal dice don't fuck me you always fuck me 18 yeah on attacks too (gasps) 22 we learned something second attack got to roll better than a fucking four that definitely hits okay 4d6 plus seven and then i get 4d6 i don't do this normally okay six ten 15 plus another 5d8 radiant damage mm-hmm because i'm a planetar not bad eight five is 13 another seven is 20 ones not for sword damage 22 and another six 28 all right that's my turn i guess stop trammel time who are you fighting the zombies yas grit yas get it son no shut your mouth which is hot the most expensive healing potion 8d4 plus eight on you good call across states yeah that's good is this a spell so i have advantage as well 16 plus seven 23 still doesn't succeed i take the full 49 41 no i'm resistant to radiant holy shit pike grog and vax for melee melee hits i got one on him everyone's remembering their blessings and all the cool shit they do pike you have a cool blessing is it doing everything you fly and you heal better you're pretty good jocks machina come on grog oh my god we've started this oh pike is after scanlan scanlan could hold his action currently 81 as a planetar you have death ward going and you're blessed goddamn i don't know what to do man can we survive one more round because if not i can grab that thing from your belt and try to go for it pike can get there in time and he can do the thing if not we try and survive one more round for you to get it in i'm nervous i'm going to fuck this thing up i've got plus seven to my strength i've got to roll 13 or higher but he gets advantage strength checks (nervous laughter) i know ugh my deodorant wore off a little bit ago am i taking yours grog are we going to try this okay all right i reach over into grog's belt grab out the trammel and the hole that's there-- i was working at the one on the shoulder so i'm going to go for the one i've been working on rappel over grab it and then rappel back in here's the thing either we do this and we try and get all of them in and then you get it at the end of your round or else we've got one more round oh my god i hate this so much do you want to give me one of your dice it's your trammel one of your die is it a d4 is it an attack oh my god i turn and grabbing vax's die i look over my shoulder at him oh my god i hate this so much a three so ten if we get two in he has a 50-50 shot bonus action i'm a planetar i don't have bonus actions wait you're not going to hold your turn and then you'll hold your action i thought you were going to hold your action so you could read the book after pike did the trammel i would have given grog the trammel dude oh my god scanlan you're still alive why have we not made fun of you for that way more throughout the years did john have a dead pool on when it was going to fall that would have been my bet we know a kitten has one hit point wait five two hit points a kitten's worth a kitten's worth of hit points but you're gone so that sucks okay you have the trammel no pike has the trammel scanlan how many hit points do you have do i do more damage to this guy or do i heal scanlan pike what about you you all right scanlan's got the book fuck yeah i'm going to fly down and do a healing touch on scanlan you've got the fucking book 39 plus three so 42 you get 42 hit points yeah and you are freed from any curse disease poison blindness or deafness and i'm going to use the rest of my movement to go up and get in vecna's face as well and be like what's up oh hey we're pulling an alfred hitchcock right now birds birds i'm john cena this is my favorite mini game can you bring that third trammel back you get to ask your god for something awesome the fact that none of us are dead fuck that hand and how far can he go he's trying to run away trying to teleport away (whoops) that's right you used your wish last night the trammels are in we're all before you just tell us what your hit points are i would be dropping my planetar shape which is making me fly right now okay yeah i'll take the other side that arkhan has not grab the other side of him and try and grapple him leaving him open and available for scanlan i'm a planetar if i drop this then i fall what am i doing athletics check oh i had bonuses to saving throws that i didn't even fucking realize it's pretty good 23 i don't even know what i have that would make him burn it i don't really have anything i don't think he would go for it a full round it's an arcane thing though right that was what i was asking none of us are unless you are arkhan so we have to hold this motherfucker down for a round hang on is it something i can do as a planetar that can read all languages and is also telepathic yeah i can read all languages as a planetar okay i have it now for no reason oh my gods oh my pelor oh my sarenrae 4th-level banishment on scanlan come on charisma it didn't help for me earlier i rolled a three i use my action to go fetal that's under a hundred though the fuck is that (air horns) okay i fly down over scanlan's shoulder and attempt to read the damn book with antlers always antlers do i get anything what do i do i've got inspiration and d4 right he saves what does that mean it's always good or bad [music] we all spoon each other as a winged spooning circle while holding scanlan while holding the book same holding on desperately wait what oh my god oh my god all right you know yeah don't congratulate him don't encourage that we learned it from watching you yeah everyone in another form can read all languages
