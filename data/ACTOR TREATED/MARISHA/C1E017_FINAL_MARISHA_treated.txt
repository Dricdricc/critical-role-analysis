[dramatic music] a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet (chuckle) of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions (thunder) under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally (soft chuckle) born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics it is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in tal'dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do (clears throat) anyways it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy i'm still in minxie form i slept in minxie form i'm going to go look for him see if i can find him in any of the rooms on the third floor why does this always happen to me i roll over on my back and i'm like those cats you see on youtube who hate being on leashes just dragging god you're not going to puke are you i'm no longer minxie to eat breakfast with my friends no i should to talk to more dwarves before i try to yeah it was a little racist well we don't have to i don't want to go yet we traveled several days here while we're in this side of the country i should probably go you know do the things i was set out to do i mean i guess if you guys don't have anything else to do yeah i'm not sure we'd have to start asking around they're remote we're secluded people we're a little secrety yeah and we haven't heard-- i just want to clarify you know i haven't talked to them in a long time so i hope they're nice and i'm sure they're-- i have to go i don't have a choice okay i just don't want to inconvenience anybody oh wait that was dwarvish inconschmenience i'm trying to work on

hydra 25 i can box him in with my wall of stone yeah i see what you're saying i'm going to pyramid him in essentially i'm going to try and make almost behind him is an auditorium and the front of him is a jabby ramp does that make sense auditorium okay i'll do a spiral like a spiraly ramp that traps him in are they in our magic box hey matt instead of wall of stone i'm actually going to cast my one 6th-level spell which is move earth yeah a few weeks ago never mind i'll stick with the original plan i can't dome him up and go ahead and push him in the water really quick at this point all right i'll stick with wall of stone which i know i can do make a hydra pyramid right there is fine oh no let me move towards scanlan yep i am okay i want to try and do a little pushy-shovery at the same time okay as he gets in that corner of that puddle i'm going to fibonacci circle and starting here push him in a bit and wrap him up yeah i want him to be tight in the circle here and if i can get it to push him towards the water it's new even though he's trapped she has a bear we got a bear four yeah i did fuck you dice gods we got here first warcraft rules should i try and get these
