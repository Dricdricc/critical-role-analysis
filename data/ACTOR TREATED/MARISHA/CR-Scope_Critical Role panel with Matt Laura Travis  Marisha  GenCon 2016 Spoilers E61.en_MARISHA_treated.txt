i already have a low charisma that's not good one guy one guy i'm sure he didn't hear enough about it in line oh jeez sorry that person can't see it's blinding up here you've been chosen for the young mothers' club okay so what our show is-- you're like the drummer in no doubt just the one naked guy what is that that was amazing oh it's your brother it's better chowazord i imagine it looks like a little chow-chow what audience is that better does that make you feel more comfortable audience how has been playing on twitch different from playing our home game audience and the smoked salmon and lox oh that's right the quiche we can remember more now than we used to because we're playing regularly whereas before we played every six weeks or so we'd take the first 30 minutes to be like matt tell us what all we did everything reality-style audience it did get talked about at one point but it didn't go forward part of it is because we were like-- and then there is also that part where we were like ah what's really exciting on that three and a half four hours on screen that's awesome we're really boring all other times i don't know if we want to expose that we're not that cool i don't think i've ever-- yeah no dude it's not like-- don't-- no it doesn't fix instant death it's like survivor man it's hard because we want it to be a surprise and also i think our idea changes from day to day i know we've all said they'd be the total opposites of whatever we're playing now i like that answer truncate go ahead audience aw thanks man it's kind of interesting i'd never really thought about it before-- you were talking about cheering each other on but it's kind of like supporting your buddies at the gym come on bro you've got this come on don't quit so i think it does create maybe a different kind of support structure i think matt touched on this a little bit but keeping in mind that there is not a whole lot of opportunities for group co-op games so keep that in mind and really utilize it as a team i'm trying not to make it sound awful i mean it whatever just have fun (laughter and applause) what inspired us you go first is there any water in the house fabio marisha and was it you or liam who was really adamant about the apostrophes okay i also had an apostrophe i came in last because i actually helped the first game and then when it turned into a campaign i'm like okay yeah if this could turn into a thing then i'll join so yeah i didn't play in that first game i was matt's assistant audience i basically just pointed at stats when they were confused it's right there (laughter) i hated it yeah i tried druid in fourth edition they were basically a watered-down support class that wasn't-- they were trying to be a jack-of-all-trades but they just sucked at everything i hated it so i was like all right i'll give druids one last chance and then she's my long-time character i was also like i'm going to play a nice person i never play nice people it's so hard to play nice people in rpgs but it's a one-shot (laughter) who's such a bitch awful selfish and evil i'm going to be on rumspringa man it's all like new fresh ink (applause) that's a good question so many things (laughter) audience stay away from children learn grasping vine placements that's what i would tell her practice oh man it's all of us on our worst days see i kind of had the version of strawberry fields on there where it's like kind of my thought on that that's like the slow-mo soundtrack that's going on in kiki's head as she's destroying things and stuff like (singing) take you down going to yeah but if you want something more amped up maybe like (singing) it's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight (laughter) are we speaking to you in our dream because i'm sorry if that's the case audience to what audience totally i mean it's tough because keyleth goes to minxie all the time that's her favorite that's her comfy spot minxie but if not she'd be-- i don't know she grew up playing as kittens and squirrels in the forest true story which is why she was weird so i don't know somehow better you mean for shy introverted players shot of tequila kicking a beholder in the face was pretty awesome as an earth elemental also rocketing from the sky as an earth elemental meteor was pretty awesome also cannonballing as an earth elemental-- (laughter) how many pencils have you broken now three yeah i was going to say the three of us have kind of casually larped for the call of cthulhu party that matt had yeah (laughter) that was what was crazy we were like-- everyone was pulling out their weapons we were like where did these come from we did not bring these or provide these it was a perfect allegory like it could have been a social experiment for how the world's going to end i swear to god it went very poorly very fast yes besides maleficent you know i think cruella de vil would be an interesting kind of not necessarily damage-dealing but you have to kind of intrigue around it cruella de vil as a boss would be cool shut up troy that's my favorite is being like oh shut up grog and screaming point of order we didn't do that you chose that (laughter) what they said (applause) that poor panel oh it's just you never mind then and yes matt and i are now signing at the green ronin booth-- at 1230 to 130
