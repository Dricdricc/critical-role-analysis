oh yeah when did you get in town you were here what were you up to what i'm doing a scan see if there's any wandering eyes he definitely had a thing we go talk to kara so you were deceiving us that's a good one have to remember that one how much of this was orchestrated from the beginning were we a distraction for the bigger picture insight check 21 (cheering) all right you won't want to frame them in any type of larger scheme considering it seems like you're quite irritated with them interesting how long have you been working for the gentleman that's a long time does he feel the same about the xhorhasian as you do you know it's not as difficult to rally a society of people against another it's not too hard to start a war if you really want to did ulog and dolan know about your involvement with the gentleman all right here's my question ulog was in against the high-richter that was his motivation dolan wanted to get after lord sutan for running him out of his practice what did you get out of all this you're only in it to be a middleman no goals or aspirations yourself yeah you got a nice face it's good for presentory purposes she does look she's got a good face that was a compliment did it not that was a compliment all right guess we'll see you around i mean-- all right let's go no that's great you guys made friends good job hello critters we are back at the time travel mart in echo park california which is one of the homes of our beloved 826la and we're going to tell you about this amazing organization and maybe play some dungeons & dragons come on i'll show you around [funky music] yeah aren't the critters such an amazing group we've heard rumors of people coming and stopping by and volunteering yeah oh my goodness that warms my heart so much i love it okay so give us a little bit of a rundown on what 826 is and what you guys do for all the amazing kids that come through here you guys have 826 chapters all over the country correct (gasps) hey nola i love it so much you guys have the time travel mart which is amazing if you're ever in los angeles you have to come visit it you have different themes for each of those across the nation yeah (laughs) that all feeds right back into the organization yeah how did that even come about how did you guys think to do that it's so brilliant now if people want to get involved in 826la or any of the 826's across the country how is the best way to go about doing that awesome you don't necessarily have to tutor if that's not your jam you can do many things right amazing all skill sets are appreciated joel thank you as always for taking the time all right we'll see you soon all right here's the deal we are dedicating the next four weeks to our favorite charity 826la now for every 5000 dollars we raise a new incentive will be unlocked for everyone we want to go back to the leaky tap you know that's safe we should also probably check in on the dodeca-doohickey as well oh right she has it never mind yeah he was at the leaky tap right we left him there okay yeah let's do that going for the chair i'm into it i hope you're okay with being blindfolded sorry it was part of the deal dolan is staying horris is getting out of dodge horris have you heard anything while we've been gone or have you been staying in here (whispers) your grog is showing 104 gold so much ramen i thought he was coming with us when we go to leave that's what i thought is that-- or am i mistaken okay out of game out of game don't you're not-- dm's not here dm's not here well we should probably blindfold him ourselves on the way there so he just don't even we'll figure it out yeah because if we take him down into the evening nip with us then they're going to want to do the whole let me take your blood thing and you weren't here and who the fuck are you and all that shit so we don't want to do that sorry also marisha talking right now here i toss him mine and jester's key just don't steal any of the pillowcases or go through any of our luggage lucien sounds very i'm trying to find myself by the way just throwing that out there yeah it's very angsty teen i dated a few luciens like way too many luciens this is beau beau but it's still not necessarily untrue lot of guys in bands yeah we definitely left our vials in a shady cellar with a bunch of underground criminals saving throw it's 100 dollars 100 dollars for every natural one 16 so is that ritual she was rambling about did you look the same or did you come back-- did you wake up to people or alone how do you know she actually thinks it's you and not you know maybe she just mistook you for someone actually named lucien so this happens to you she kept referencing a book what if we could find the book yes no doesn't mean you have to find meaning in meaningless things you know just because you know about your past doesn't mean you have to be beholden to it if you-- you don't owe your past shit if i don't feel anything about my past but i still remember it and i still don't give a fuck about where i came from then why should you care about shit that you don't even remember molly you seem like you have a pretty solidified identity for someone who has only had consciousness for two years things came back quick do you feel like there's still remnants of whoever you once were that have informed who you are now interesting i can kind of agree with that cheers to bullshit don't believe him jester you ever think you could actually be doing damage though setting people on false paths some people are vulnerable and looking for answers come on patterson come on help us out here right now this is your day job did you ever know anyone who did used to try and set people on wrong paths with their fortune telling no still in the zone of truth now well this was fun for what it's worth i like you a little better now you don't have to reciprocate it i get that a lot oh yeah fjord and i found out that we're probably going to be facing some undead wispy things that might electrocute us okay do you know how to fight them you are (chuckles) yes it's so good it's a good movie a short rest yeah you could do
