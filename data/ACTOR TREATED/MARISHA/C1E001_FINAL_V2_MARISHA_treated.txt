a mouse up to an hour yeah take a nap oh we should give our comment cards to balgus balan here take him the extras yes a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet of course it would be unwise underestimate her based on first impressions [thunder crack] dwarven eggs are very good why did you think that after the magic hand failed that the big thunder ice wave would work that's okay it's the thought that counts grog it's the thought that counts yeah i know yes you should be a lady dwarf that's also where the hashtag not all trolls came from bringing it back percy can i try okay i just wanted to do that once i'm sorry he's on vacation you'll
