before that we found the bar (cheering) liquid courage hi i'm marisha ray thank you thank you first time comer long time lover (laughter applause) the slightly awkward half-elf druid on critical role (applause) i probably won't call you on it i'm more likely to give a spoiler than probably anyone else in this room yeah that was probably more for me than anybody else that's a true story yeah to that i'll say you are all great friends good on you for being drug here they owe you one tomorrow it's fine that's true in the 30 seconds when people are running you turn into lifeguards for a second like no the concrete's slick oh there we're good we're covered it's taylor's fault i mean taylor's responsibility this is the importance of clerics you guys (cheering) we tend to not leave the studio until about 1130 midnight-ish anyway then we had to pack up when we got home then you have the adrenaline so you're like i can't believe raishan she's such a bitch and then it's hard to go to sleep that's basically my night every thursday night god damn it oh yeah you east coasters (cheering and groaning) it's honestly true we made that time specifically because it's the earliest we can do to accommodate sam hey man he's just slowly turning into mr disney not like nbc did (crying) (awwing) it's really great show but look it's nothing she hasn't said herself she's like well my d&d group though i know that's how you know you're winning biggest job of my career-- d&d group you'll have all of our critical role t-shirts to keep you warm i love because you were so adamant about your warning that everyone was like-- (laughter) it's fine okay yes you left first audience i can hear you you're good if you want to tilt the mic down a little bit there you go yeah audience if i could cast a musical audience if i could put on a musical ooh it's like the power you go first it's hard to do hamilton better yeah god that's such a great show matt and if i was to reinvent a musical okay so you could go one of two ways right you could be like i just want to direct this and make the best version it could possibly be in its pure state or you could turn something on its head like a terrible musical like cats now you're giving me ideas maybe i could do a 2017 version of cats and it's like lol cats and it's all internet memes you know (laughter) that could go into-- that's magical mr mistoffelees right there cats such a bullshit answer by the way matt and yeah we've got plans oh my god can we come out with critical role branded spices like just legit spices i don't know i feel like that's a lawsuit ready to happen right there yeah tweet all of your complaints at geek & sundry not at us okay yes hi sure yeah all the things yep and did you make him sleep on the couch how many times have i heard that one (laughter) that's a good question there's been a few times i think there was a little bit there for a while that even our fellow game players were like marisha you know something and i was like i would love it if he talked to me you guys but he just doesn't it's a little like mom you're supposed to knock yeah he does a lot he does that it's all true that's what's funny about it yeah but i've gotten that people have been like oh is matt going easier on her and there's also certain people who have said the opposite of like they think he's being harder on me in order to really prove that he's not being easier on me you know so it's a catch-22 but luckily i think there's especially a lot of us who're starting to come out of the woodwork these days and we're like no we're on the level we're cool we have a pretty good separate dm-and-player relationship and we try to respect it yeah cheating's not fun that's what people have always said do you go into his notes do you sneak into his notes into his binders i'm like no that's dumb you have our attention (laughter) oh you just read that off like major-league baseball stats audience good for you it was better off in your hands audience those damn vision quests i think the twins kind of went first because their dad happened to be like the president of syngorn which is kind of like one of our neighboring towns so we wound up dealing with some of their stuff at the home game and i remember the first time when they were like hello father and we were all like what because they didn't tell us that because that was the first time we'd really gotten to anyone's backstory stuff so we were like plot twist anyway continue audience thank you yeah i remember when you went to go get drinks with eric who's my writer for signal boost and you were like hey man i'd really love to go get drinks and he was like oh okay yeah sure man i've never really hung out one-on-one i'm not sure what he wants to talk to me about and then his side is that you sat him down and you were like dude okay here's what i'm planning for their campaign and i have to tell someone (laughter) once again can't talk to anybody yeah eric came back with gray hair he'd seen the future you started as a dm i love displacer beasts just because they're displacer kitties they're so cute oh you're so scary aren't you you think you're scary that's how you beat displacer beasts you're just like you're scary yeah totally no they were really hard at level three also i mean beholders beholders are iconically amazing and hard to fight and each one is a little tactically different i love that what about you so fun super fun damn it anthony smart guy no pressure or anything (laughter) i feel like we should i'm sorry i couldn't even attempt to answer a question like sam can so i'm not even going to try i have one of my new revelations with keyleth is-- i've said this a couple times but i genuinely feel like ever since i've embodied keyleth and especially more so since the stream started because we play more on a weekly basis i genuinely feel like she's made me a more empathetic and compassionate person because me personally i'm more closed off and a little bit more-- i'm more introverted i have my social anxieties keyleth helped me get that first instinct because her first instinct is always i'm going to do whatever i can for the betterment of other people that's not necessarily my first instinct she taught me a lot genuinely about that then i remember even the moment that i had with patrick rothfuss on stream which i don't want to like-- once again no spoilers (applause) sorry i talked for a long time on that one keep going audience yeah audience that's a great question keyleth has always felt like the odd man out you know once again she'll always go with the flow unless she feels like it's real bad guys like maybe we should really think about this i've had a few people in the interwebs be like why does keyleth always have to disagree with everybody she doesn't actually it's just that she doesn't really speak up a lot of the times you're literally only remembering the times that she does it's taken her a while to get that courage to be that kind of a person she also thinks-- it's not that she thinks she knows-- i know-- she's the least coolest member of the group (awwing) hey that's her purpose that's her role it's good audience yeah thank you yeah of course we had our pathfinder game before we switched over he was also my first dungeon master it was before we were dating you actually dmed for me and my boyfriend at the time that's true that's also true was that a matt mercer horn that's amazing anyway we played pathfinder i played a buffy the vampire system for a while which was fun together if you step outside of rpgs for a bit-- in terms of couple gaming-- we play mansions of madness all the time mansions of madness is great and they just came out with a new system that's amazing a second edition we also play a lot of minecraft together because it's our come home from a 14 hour day and need to zone out and hit blocks for an hour it's our zen thing and you get the nice minecraft zen meditation music you're like this is almost like a spa oh my god that's the best yes i do oh man you get the cows i'll get the sheep audience yeah we play wow together too totally good times (cheering) hi the light was obscuring you a little bit i can see you now-- can't really see you now i can see you now it's true yeah (cheering) that's a good question to preface a little bit about what she's talking about in case you didn't know all of us put out character spotify playlists to help give you a little more insight into some of our characters we did it last year and we're right in the middle of our second round because quite frankly we enjoy doing them so much and we wanted to do it again we're all music lovers who's not a music lover this is magfest everyone here's got to be a music lover we wanted to do it again you can all find them on geek & sundry spotify i actually went searching a decent amount for a lot of my stuff it definitely has a lot of my musical influences my dad raised me on a lot of bluegrass and classic rock and folk and things like that i grew up in kentucky-- this part of the woods you guys they're all songs that i love and definitely speak to my influence of music but still very much have that keyleth taste we get really anal retentive about them we'll be like no it's not perfect enough it's close but not enough we've spent months on those finding the perfect songs that's not true you had an even harder time because you were doing the npc playlists you had one or two songs per character which is hard wait which one oh bangarang oh yeah that's a good one are you gilmore audience or talks machina hi ben much to their chagrin i'm sure i just don't listen to them (cheering) not perfect maybe time for one or two more yes thank you can i just say real quick it sounds like we're all going down on the titanic for this last question so i just want to relish this moment proceed green arrow proceed audience like when we started streaming oh before stream uhh (chocolate-anticipatory gibberish)
