everybody right up front it's ten foot right can i do my tidal wave from this direction backwards ten feet who's it going to hit i know grog is dextrous so grog can take it sorry grog but i want to start here and go backwards towards you no grog to get hit yeah it's a ten-foot-wide column that i just want to go back or grog sorry i was confused when you said grog so who's it going to hit tova only because i think she's more dextrous than him no it's not that much five six seven-- ten and a reroll i do an eight so that's eight-- 23 damage thank you and he should be knocked prone-- no it's an eight wait five seven that's 10 18 18 damage and he's knocked prone and then the water spreads across the ground in all directions and extinguishes unprotected flames in an area within 30 feet of it that's all i cared about mainly okay i tried sorry guys i'm going to back up as-- can i crawl do i have enough movement to crawl back through the window i'll do that yeah i want to keep it use it

okay i say hey sorry about the whole tsunami thing you got this and i give her a healing word at level one i'm going to give you-- shit-- plus my spell modifier sorry nine hit points yeah tiny pockets this is a problem of women's fashion to be fair why tiny pockets come on women's fashion come on doesn't matter he's dead he's so dead get that grit back you get another grit back get that grit back in the fetal position that's totally correct yeah someone's unconscious and we can't tell that they're unconscious that's not great saving dex 14 we're both grappled fucking dick i have advantage on that i'll take that 18 yeah i just have to beat the damage correct 18 aw desu desu what 32 i mean yeah 17 plus 20 plus 23-- my sunbeam can i use my reaction to cast absorb elements yes i do never done this before let me double-check i capture some of the energy and i store it and i have resistance to the next damage type that i take that and the first time i hit with a melee attack on my next turn i can do an extra 1d6 of that damage type beautiful so another 11 would've made it 82 okay i have to beat a ten correct nope wait what do i add oh no i'm good then i'm good that's exactly a 17 what it's me attacking 60-- wait how halved is it halved wait what matt marisha and it's not i mean i'm still up with 20 hit points no i was at 82 minus 62 which means-- 20 points (sighs) okay time to go big i am going to cast shapechange my 9th-level spell and i am going to turn into a fire giant yeah so as i'm down my eyes light up and i start to turn into a giant and i want to reach up and grab him by the throat and try and stand up and see if i can pile-drive him i am is this plus 11 just to my attacks natural 20 (cheering) how do you know what basic damage is well it just gives me multi-attack and it gives me a greatsword melee attack that is 6d6 that is one two three four i need one more ten 16 24 damage 24 right so doubled that so 48 damage plus seven yeah (grunts) well i didn't move yeah i stand up and i look at grog and in giant i say 'sup what's up man yeah yeah ooh am i still all fire giant form that's cool okay with disadvantage on both of them just one of them that's eight plus 11 so that's 20-- so that's 7d6 plus six one two-- (very deep voice) i imagine he's going to tell the others oh this shapechange has so many weird things that's fantastic 18 hi tary i'm antlers fist bump your bear-kini aww can i pick him up by his ankles and schoolyard bully-style shake him out from his feet upside-down for pocket change i shapechange back to keyleth for a second do you know which section of the prison they're in aw the worst idea you could ever do well okay hang on what happens next because aren't we supposed to be arrested next i think reinforcements are here did i see anything that looked like guards that wore like the armor the gold armor no throughout the city just in general since i've been in hell what are they were there any like erinyeses or succubuses that were also guards that would be one of these people i know but i could still be a guard and follow you guys there then i'm someone on the outside and not in prison as maybe a first responder if i say hey i found these guys and i walk with you guys all the way to the prison can i stealth can i turn into one of the impish creatures in gold armor have they seen me yet i don't have the gold armor never mind i'll just be myself for right now who's all been seen that's a lot are those bone demony guys i'll turn into one of the bone devils i'll turn into a bone devil (speaks fake infernal) fucking hell eight total i give him a little bit of a twitch like maybe i'm the damaged bone devil oh god okay i drop form fuck this asshole right left yeah right left straight straight right left straight laura and right i mean i could probably also beast shape out of this if i really wanted to well you know i was kinda waiting to see what everybody else did travis and okay and i beast shape into a rat technically yeah and then i shape back to keyleth and then keys keys right there on the other side or something keys i'm going to do a thorn whip thorn whip them to me wait oh sorry which are in the satchel on the other side of the bags right i got it okay are there any other extra lockpicks in here investigation check natural one honey you're a hoarder we really need to clean out your purse i really can't find any-- wait who's stuck fucking doors it's always doors do we want to take a short rest while we're supposedly-- all right let's go i can do that to us is everyone cool with that i can still plane shift us so i can burn one of my higher-level spells-- like an eight on the scale of zero to nine-- and be animals and then i can save my seventh-level for plane shift in case of emergency can i not do that with animal shapes i can't turn into the insects hm have i seen anything like flies or rats or anything like that hang on i've seen rats and i've seen what have i seen any-- i've got to be beasts are there anything like bats have i ever seen any bats i mean technically with animal shapes i can change us with an action correct yeah as long as we don't get caught all right so we're starting as bats bats correct so as long as we're cool with me losing my ninth-level shapechange i can't escort us as an erinyes anymore how much longer is my shapechange left it lasts for an hour i don't speak the shit so bats wait i can technically make some of us bats and some of us other things correct i can choose does anyone not want to be a bat for any particular reason sonar echolocation we have darkvision bats go in swarms we're all bats this is the best plus ten 26 we can always be rats whenever the time is necessary keep going come on come on come on hang on well technically what do bats have 5e bats-- bats-- that's true we are a swarm of bats (bat squeaks) those bats were jus-- i made no promises other than bats go go go and we're definitely doubling our movement here and we're dashing bat ac we did pretty good you guys we got pretty far all right not great i don't know if we can get in and out of this quick and keep going-- -- because i can keep turning us into these 11 as long as i don't lose concentration i can keep turning us into different things correct it's a concentration of up to 24 hours so as long as i don't use a concentration-- on a subsequent turn i can use my action to transform affected creatures into new forms 11 not great correct so that's probably exactly what i'm going to do is to try and not get hit by the by choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range you transform each target into the form of a large or smaller beast oh shit can i change people as a bat but can i stay as a bat and change other people yeah okay i'm going to turn-- do you want to be a bat too i'm going to turn both vax and percy into bats what i asked what you wanted to be and you said a bat bat we're both bats and we're peaced out again if we can we're going to peace out i'm going to look at vex and go (squeaking noise) uh-huh i'm following her vex was leading the way she knows where to go right yeah to the right yeah as far as we know the right means right let's go dear god i can't believe this shit but i was holding my movement to move with vex laura and i can't fucking hold a movement i did an action to make sure they were bats currently 16 so it's six plus four total so ten okay good the first time good the second time and seven plus my constitution correct so that is an 11 the third time all
