merciri roll a d20 is this because of the facetime error bring them out yeah it's not slicky poster paper it's-- not even ten seconds i have put on my goggles for sure can octopuses see in the dark if you do the facemask thing i guess i'll go up front no one's called a partner yet so we're going to come to a conclusion later maybe i have no idea what we're talking about i think i would be a little more confident if we had a vague idea of a plan don't get me wrong super down to fly by the seat of my pants that type of girl but sneaking in killing people in the middle of the night two armies fight getting captured-- these all sound like real big stories i like that better goats are weird square pupils encounter worm-- sam and i think they still have square pupils can i keep a lookout to see if there's any markings on the walls any signs of directional type of code or language while we're walking 19 i have a question for caduceus cad do you have any idea how far underground we are okay that was my question (laughter) i've heard of faery creatures i bet they live-- it's see-through on the inside right ooh stealth checks 31 underwater water source i look to see if there's any signs of life any humans that have been here before people signs of life or signs that people have been here before yeah campfires that have been extinguished 11 just looking over his shoulder you have no initiative bonus 19 it's not but no one else spoke up so cad caleb nott i had a screamer earlier what did you roll oh we might miss ah yeah just grappled strength check versus their strength check if i remember correctly no don't please stop please stop don't touch me it was so pretty when we slept in a geode that was awesome remember that okay can i get closer to the roper i was hoping he would do the reel thing but to me because i'd love to get real so i can hit it well i don't know what else to do but to wail on this motherfucker first attack is real bad it's a natural two next attack is not that much better 20 total okay then i will reroll that one with a natural one so that's cool that's two attacks so far i rolled a two then a one technically but you roll disadvantage does disengage count if you're grappled so disengage wouldn't help me escape from it but i already used my action to attack so i might as well flurry of blows disadvantage on the first one nope that's a two again second one is a natural 20 and a 12 bringing me to a 20 total it's terrible two seven damage i turn to everyone and go i think i broke my wrist then that's it yeah can i do the thing no i have to hit twice never mind nope oh can i do that stunning strike (fake crying) there is a god okay that's my turn yes she is ah doo-bah that's the way it works i'm still restrained i'm going to stir around my stick and try and jab it into his eyeball wait straight roll i'm going to get rid of all those it never happened i don't think it worked nope that's a 14 second attack now it's a 19 so it definitely hits that was with my staff i said so it's a d8 seven points of damage i'm going to re-stun it can i do that stunning strike okay i'm going to move on from that 14 flurry of blows wait why do i keep rolling twice i keep thinking i need to roll twice just once ah natural 20 it's so manic but it's true doubling the dice that's a three plus a six so that's 11 going for the uvula last one 18 for this one i'm going to try and grab onto its tongue because i know lot of blood vessels in the tongue and start trying to rip it another 11 damage i say drop it drop it caleb do you have any use for this nott nott roper tongue what i'm still throwing rocks fuck 11 kill it with cantrips no i haven't seen any form of writing no offshoots nothing like that it's more information which is always good hey guys i'm just saying if we're going to be underground in a blank boring shit-hole tunnel for a whole 'nother day i still have some of these mushrooms left over from mollymauk might just help make it fun i'm real bored i'm just so bored yeah (gasps) okay it already starts good you guys it was a glistening night-- the snow fell on the winding paths it was chilly she could feel her nipples getting hard it starts so soon it starts so soon she felt the warmth of a fire she could feel his warm touch as it was grasping around-- as his strong burly hairy arms wrapped around her waist she could feel her breath leaving her bodice this is so good jester (stuttering) thanks as she reached down-- that's funny that was exactly what was about to happen i'm sorry what i'm going to-- i bookmarked it is there any remnants of precious metals coals things that would be mined we've got to be right would i know the exact boundary line of xhorhas between the empire do they use the mountains if we're under the mountains it could be a long way up and we don't know what those mountains look like i mean i don't know it also could be fall and temperate and beautiful (laughs) okay here's the other thing though-- sorry i'm dying at the hammer this is arguably going to lead to a nexus right like an entry point so what's on the other si-- did they build a military base around the entrance to this tunnel system and is that what we're about to walk into if we go forward if we keep following this is it going to lead us-- travis and yeah no i know i was just kind of throwing it out there that's a good idea 17 oh jeez talk to them tell them we're friends yeah bot oh yeah you were just lifting so many pebbles you'll be great oh man not again (yelling) i will head forward-- -- but power walking like a badass strolling behind in case i want to deck some kobolds in the face what why though that's pretty good you're just dangling beware the spirit of the maine coon i jump down and take out one of my shurikens and chop caleb free ah jeez make big mess take the whole cage ah it's rabies the thing is going to die in ten more feet from something else let's let them do it for a little bit they might have useful information oh so they're not even being secretive about it matt and got it you mean like as in (projecting) hey we should go to sleep like that my feet they hurt because you're a god i'm glad to see your true form mistress i'll try to look for firewood but i'm so exhausted no just visitingmarisha  spurt sam sam i'm interested no that's exactly what he said do you have bug allergies oh no have you been stung it works it's amazing (groans) dodge those juices wait like the green slime you have right there in the-- oh okay (laughter) would you like to follow us towards the light at the end of the tunnel i'm dying i am dying is it obsidian goodberries stop i just got better we fulfilled our end of the bargain i feel okay we're stealthing natural 20 and where are we so attractive so sexy i mean use a distraction get them looking at something else i am a great sprinter like real good 100 meter dash right just saying which cave our cave ooh lava monster would i know anything about giants reading up on them or anything cobalt 19 so probably not amicable or prone to negotiation and they craft things so they're not stupid averagely smart yeah i read this tome once in the library but i was a little distracted when reading it because the monks had also drawn a bunch of dick and dudes putting horns up their butts in the margins it just happens
