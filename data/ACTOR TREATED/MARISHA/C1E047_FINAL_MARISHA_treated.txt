someone's watching my old stomping grounds college days yeah it's 1200 am so you know it's official they do oh snap my last episode of signal boost is this tuesday yeah we rotate hosts out because it's like our favorite things and i don't want to have to-- oh thank you sam thank you i'm glad my friends support me yes yeah i'm not letting it go i'm still producing it do you want to host okay i'll make that work apparently that's up to you guys i don't think i can transport us out of here until we sleep i'm going to go ahead and assist them because i didn't use any 5th-level spells yes scan-lan so regal of you scan-lan i mean my people have lived here for thousands of years sure i mean generally we're safe as long as dragons aren't smashing through the village but i mean if you have an alternative you know you've talked about it so much now scanlan is this a joke sure do you want to tell them it is your humble abode all right yeah little peep holes keyleth just gets a nosebleed for no reason she's not sure why let me go try and gather the rest of the ashari can i get a plate of food from one of the ghosts as proof i just pop out of the door and address the people aw son of a-- hey guys hey it's okay it's actually really nice it's been rough why don't we all take a night off and everyone come in and get some food take a night off so it can't be the middle of a battle sure like five cows they each return with one grog you just punched a cow in the face i don't know okay i don't know i'm just chilling i'm eating food relaxing i'm not great at identifying what they are i can generally be like that's magical but i don't know arcane things only natural-based magics why keyleth just picks up her plate and awkwardly leaves you're going to be one of those segway assholes now i'll be reading my alchemy book because i have had so little time to catch up on my reading we never do did you feed the dog (gasps awake) scanlan on my door who is it i open the door of course please cerkonos what kind of powers beyond those of druidic nature thordak you acted within the good nature of our people there's nothing wrong with that how old was this girl when she came to you and how old is she now so she's 19 20 and what was her race she seemed human what do you mean what was her name are you referring to something in particular cerkonos i shall keep an ear open for the name raishan if i hear anything about her i'll send word thank you cerkonos and i'm glad that you're still with us kaitiaki cerkonos and i start poring through my notes for the name raishan because keyleth believes she has heard that name before as one of the dragons correct one of the white-- --the green one okay okay do i have any other reference would i know anything else about that fucking bitch yes they will crystal chandelier do you have wine and ale at the breakfast buffet i'll have a mimosa schrodinger's trinket i had a really weird night too what happened in your because i mean flight no i want to hear about your night i want to learn how you fly vax i think you were a bad influence we used that in an emergency what do you say percy i think it's kind of funny all right that is pretty cool vex that's pretty badass yeah shoot some arrows i reach on the table and i grab what i'm sure is a whole chicken sitting there and i hold it up and i go-- okay vex ready ready vex vex trust trust vex please god may your aim be true today vex she did it i hand the chicken to scanlan it'll take some practice you know beyond it being an engineering issue it might be a greed issue first look-- it's phenomenal it's been a long few weeks i don't care i don't care we're never going to see gern again i have so many other things to care about no i'm just it's been a long few-- look i don't care anymore no i just don't want you to die i don't want you to die i don't want you to die because of your greed i don't care that you have-- you look amazing doesn't she look amazing well that's phenomenal that you've come to terms with it i don't know about the rest of us in the room that all watched you die though it's really cool i don't care about the broom just don't get into trouble i guess you got out you came out on top this time it might not happen next time all right i think she's listening to me i think i did i don't care anymore oh chicken yeah cerkonos stopped by not as my elder he stopped by as my respected elder do you all remember the name raishan apparently she's our little infiltrator she came to the fire ashari she came to pyrah about four years ago and the ashari being the adoptive people that we are they took her in they adopted a dragon they do they were unaware that she was a dragon it makes her fairly close to thordak it would seem apparently when she came to the fire ashari she was about 15 years old and as a human woman she was making it seem like she was 15 and they started realizing that she possessed powers far beyond anything that they had seen before and then these powers began to exceed anything beyond our druidic capabilities and it would seem that they realized that too late cerkonos said one day they woke up and the mountain was spewing fire and was angry with lava and when he went to investigate it she was there ripping open the rift and that was when everything happened when he came to consciousness everything was destroyed so that's all he saw and she was gone but we know where she went next i was trying to skip exposition i thought you guys could fill in the blanks thank you i'll work on that next time raishan i'm not sure don't trust anyone and waffles and one thing that this does confirm is that this has been a plan that's been in the process for a very very long time what was his name hang on we need the titanstone knuckles of kord which kevdak has odessa's mate is south of the frostweald you know what grog it's been a while why exactly were you beat up and kicked out of your herd okay so they might have a grudge about that and i can also theoretically turn into a wolf to help us find things i was talking as in-- you mean it's like at least six or possibly more than six how fast actually is the reproduction process of goliaths yeah this could be bad this could be bad how easy is that well we need these vestiges we cannot do anything without these vestiges and don't we theoretically need the vestiges before we go visit odessa's boyfriend sorry but wasn't pike and her grandfather the reason well remember westruun is under dragons right now i can but it's under dragon reign in fact isn't that where raishan stopped off okay and did we also want to check out the cobalt reserve which was in westruun or did allura already handle that and we're cool she was there and it looked pretty trashed it looked like she grabbed a lot of the last of the good things just not that one time that we want to actually know do i remember any trees not my strong suit a straight intelligence check nine it's been a few years you guys after a while i could get us close or i could scry and look for a tree can i take time to do that the closest destination would the crossroads be good maybe get us to the crossroads but they've got wyverns policing right in westruun i'm going to assume let's do the crossroads we could theoretically run into your herd though to the crossroads so i would be going northeast from the crossroads or if i wanted to go in the bramblewood i would have to southwest to get to the frostweald where's the bramble forest let's go to the forest let's go to the bramblewood forest there's got to be some big trees there i remember a few big trees i remember admiring a few big trees in the bramblewood forest that was good i guess it took me a moment to find signal okay all right we're good i think i got one all right sorry guys this is as close as i could get us mist form we could be clouds how long would it take to get us in mist form should we turn into clouds and go yeah i'm picking my spells because i haven't done that yet but yeah we'll poof wind walk yeah 16 can't do anything right now i guess so we're in a corn field ooh natural 19 36 it's a bigger problem does he see us what type of people are they interested in then why did they take your daughter does he have patrols does he have wyverns working for him as well that fly around these people oh no do they look like him maybe one of the dragons was green and the green one kept going oh man i feel like you all are talking like i normally do and i'm talking like grog normally does this is such a weird day what are we going to do right now this is a coup on a grander scale than whitestone that we're talking about that's not a bad idea question could i work with percy i have entangle learned today could we fashion a quick entangle trap where when the guy steps into it he'll be entangled or i could maybe just be prepared for it i'll be prepared for it all right i'll just be prepped with it and try and maybe keep a bit of a distance because i'm going to be doing a trap here it's going to be 20 feet you don't want to be in it just step back all right (whoosh) i'm waiting for percy's cue 20 feet it always works is it obvious me 19 natural 20 so 40 actually i have a stealth of seven 47 fuck vex grog do you remember killing him five seconds ago oh no you guys you were conscious of that is it me very easily did we yeah we won't look like crops i use my druidcraft to grow some flowers on top of the dirt great so very successful trip stopping down we can why would we not and what are the rest of us going to do just wait me scanlan and grog so why don't we just not go in right now do we still have pass without a trace 24 does this appear to be goliath-built so does it look pretty jerry-rigged yeah he cast the protection spell on us now what no we're fucking clouds 32 not reggie what green lights (panicked yelling) oh it's just me (relieved) oh they've made really poky fences everywhere i also think they're trying to be scary not that you're not scary all the time grog i just think they're like ooh they really want to look tough yeah it's a nice house or if he does rounds to check in on people is kevdak known to ever wander off by himself does he take interest in his subjects to where we could corner him alone there also could be the issue of are they going to go looking for horace that's not a bad idea what would bring kevdak out grog question is your herd and kevdak the type where if you start getting the upper hand in this fight will the herd move to protect kevdak so they'll honor a one-on-one fight they'll honor that they won't pull a fast one and swarm in when he's on his last leg do you want to be on a hilltop like standing on a hilltop because we could arrange that we know where kevdak is he doesn't seem to be going anywhere judging by the-- no i didn't hear any of that look could we hear horace when he was interrogating him judging by the way horace was speaking it sounds like they're pretty settled in for right now so we know where he is now it'll give us a little bit more time to formulate our plan this is your fight grog we'll follow you in this one let's wait for pike pike might even be an emotional trigger the herd if they see her maybe that's true they probably don't give any shits good point we do we can float on if anyone asks where horace is what happened to horace reginald ooh shit grog you're in new york can you stuff her in your suitcase while you're there bring her back just commandeer her she's tiny she might be a little loud season break
