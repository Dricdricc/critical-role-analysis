is she watching hi mom alex is brilliant we got it back it's okay clarence liam and so wait are we all reunited oh welcome back pike are we all reunited where have you been ashley well i had quite a time when we were up on the tower i noticed something and i felt i had to leave because i started to have a vision i take pike and i kind of pull her out of the tent really quick and i'm like-- okay he's like a mind flayer and we found him in a hole under a waterfall but he's cool but he wants vengeance he's like outcast yeah but he's gonna help us fight all of his tribe who hates us yeah maybe we can figure out something a little bit more jerryrigged they can read our minds clarence sorry clarota sorry clarota i just have one quick question why would you want to rejoin your colony after they've banished you why not leave you're not diseased you're special you said there was a big army front guarding this general of duergar oh he's just right across the way an entire colony of mind flayers really please do tell is there something under the lake through the lake no i can cast water breathing on all of us i can always turn into like a whale so wait is going through the lake gonna get us through to the general well we can figure out to where where all of us can fly over them i'm more concerned about us cloaking ourselves even if we're flying they're still going to see us that was one time just one time amityville twitch stream i think so well we went over the top of it and kind of looked down when i was bending the water back we were kind of in that area right that was that area but the lake-- go fishing yeah i can attempt to try and drain the lake a little bit control water's a level five spell i managed to get it stopped-- a lake i mean i can make a giant whirlpool didn't that happen already so we can face cthulhu or little cthulhu minons seems to be our choice ooh i see what you're getting at we need to build a coconut radio with some sort of interference i believe pike and i both have access to spells like that not necessarily i think it'll stun them long enough for us to get across wait that's not a bad idea pike can we temporarily enchant the magic carpet as a spotlight as we fly over as a light death ray we should have daylight where's my book where's my player's handbook daylight pike and i can cast daylight on our magic carpet i have to take a nap though what's that i mean technically i can also turn into something flying i could back you guys up if someone else wants to take the carpet i can cast daylight on your helmet on your pot helmet yeah all right what does vax have to say about this yes that one do you know what time it is i'm feeling a bit nappy i have to rest so i can-- i'm gonna read up on this daylight spell so that you and me can both cast it ashley yeah we'll just take a nap and just get you know rest our muscles and get ready for the fight i go ahead and i light an incense in our teepee and i make some flowers grow that's better that's nice i'm meditating oh pooper 19 goblin molotov cocktails i like that i'm gonna put a giant sunlight beacon on his head and i'm gonna release him to the wilds oh how are we gonna get him over it i like that well i was gonna say can we set down where we're kind of backing you guys up holding the fort down while you guys go i'm not worried about that i say we might as well go closest to the barracks as we can get i'm gonna start buffing people like crazy oh joss whedon up in this bitch well i can cast pass without a trace on myself and as long as we hug close to me there's an area around me that's like a dark shadow we get like all stealthy wait wait wait don't go in yet let me buff people i go ahead and i cast enhance ability on vex to increase your dexterity which is your stealth right and then i'm gonna go ahead and let me keep track of all this and i'm gonna go ahead and cast daylight on grog's helmet are we ready for this are we going and i'm gonna go ahead and cast daylight on-- i'm gonna go ahead and cast pass without a trace on myself i turn into an eagle and i'll take the gnomes i guess the rest of them are on the rug i'm gonna fly in the middle between grog and the carpet that way my pass without a trace encompasses everybody even with the plus 10 18 oh cool thinking about-- just falls from the air we can start on the roof that way that gives us time let's just land on the roof we still have that plus 10 oh that was cocked oh no i'm like those boobies that crash land when they fall well i rolled a one and you still have my buff you didn't bring your stuff (metal gear voice) must have been my imagination (all laugh) sneak attack oh there's scanlan i cast light on grog's head do you have like a picture or a file anywhere saved of your-- of your sheet also nine kill him yeah vax derge yes come on grog this is all you're good for come on woo nice you're the brightest tool in the shed today finally now he's getting out toys i got him this for christmas two years ago and he's finally using it you're supposed to know everything woo ♫ a whole new spell ♫ no one can tell us no ♫ except for matt (all laugh) well he does all of them and then divides he rolls all of them and then divides your first one was-- i-- come on down and i say good work guys that was cool that was great that's what i was gonna say i cast grasping vine and i just take a vine and i tie his hands behind his back and kind of grapple him well no i'm not damaging him i'm just-- yeah damn it (whimpers) this is the second time i rolled a one on my stealth check i'm not stealthy today  what is that can i reactionary real quick take my grasping vine and just lift him and kind of put him in the corner to keep the general safe i was just trying to keep him safe no breaks exercise your kegels 36 shit does this guy appear to be messed up by the daylight at all yeah clarota so 20 hits he's still grappled oh from the grapple too this is a whole new meaning to point-blank that's amazing aw come on there's a bigger problem bro fire in the hole so upon seeing this big thing crash in and i'm like oh now you're really angry but i just kind of analyze him and i say okay and then i go (grunts) and i turn into a rhinoceros kaiju battle (all laugh) i'm charging him so if he fails to save i knock him over that's plus seven so 19 awesome a strength save aw damn it he does i do 2d8 of bludgeoning damage seven nine 14 damage well i charged yeah oh wait no no no that's right keep going it's actually 15 damage i always forget that i have a plus one to attack we all get attacks we get advantage right 19 17 think your arm might be a bit busted really wait how did that happen didn't you get that speed boost oh yeah yeah 826la they're a non-profit organization that helps primarily with literacy and creative story children for children between the ages of like five and 18 they have a really great young authors book that you can buy that's a collection of all of the kids' book and you can also go and check out the time travel mart there's one in echo park and then there's also one in marina del rey but you should just google 826 'cause i know there's one in seattle i know there's one in like atlanta new york san francisco there might be an 826 in your city 826la is who we're raising money for but yeah all of the 826 store fronts are a little bit different depending on where you go they're super cool great for my back so you have to sub bye everybody who's not a sub well your word is not important we're all good i actually had matt as my first dm way before all this started so i played a few other games and then now i'm back to the og master i see does keyleth have limitations on what animals she can transform into yeah for the most part i can only transform into beasts and i have to be under a certain challenge rating so right now at my level i can only turn into beasts that are a challenge reading of three or lower yeah a third of my druid level which is nine right now but for the most part i can change into almost anything as long as it's under a challenge rating of three you know pike i feel like we haven't actually girl talked about this we should that's hot i'm just concerned if he could treat you well he's got bad habits oh it's true our first game was great i've got some good memories from that one i don't think a few people were crying i think everyone was crying we know these characters almost as well as we know each other now wait we have a tower they built a castle greyskull i mean we're all really deep thought out characters oh you mean like right now yeah don't do it right now yeah no not right now maybe next week but i'll be there is anybody else gonna be there we'll be there there's something really amazing about the fact that we're all essentially kind of building and communally developing a story together and that's something that not a whole lot of things can grant you and we don't really get in today's society much we're all kinda creating this as a thing and i think it's good that we're like hey this is socially acceptable d&d's cool everyone should play d&d oh yeah our kitty shirts always yeah like that time we walked through the back door of the thieves' guild that was fun what's up thieves' guild 'sup i didn't know that either that's cool travis how did you pick your character i remember at the time i had a we were playing another campaign and i had like a rogue assassin that you were in with me and i had a kind of assassin character who was super seductress and really high charisma and i remember when i joined this game i didn't really know any of you guys really all that well and i was kind of new to this world so i ended up going with a kind of druid and i kind of deliberately made her introvert in a weird way to kind of reflect my newcoming to the group but i was like whoa it'll be like i can be quiet so keyleth has a really low charisma but i kind of spin it in that she's naive and doesn't really know and that's why she says things like but clarence (all laugh) wait we haven't heard tiberius' story as sorcerer then we can answer that question that's fair nope yorda youree yourdee yourd with dork it was timed actually one of my favorite stories that i tell all the time is about you from our first game 'cause if you remember i didn't play i just kinda helped matt help you guys i was like a d&d minion and i remember i was helping you and i remember you were like so if i just wanted to go up and punch those guards i could do that and i was like yeah well you would go up and you would punch them and then matt would tell you how you'd do that and then you went like this you were like yeah you were like so we can do anything (all laugh) hey would that count as fan art if fans made us music could we then use that yeah he's nodding some consent forms yeah any music people anything atmospheric yeah people are asking how she came back i almost did yeah i feel like everyone tries to make decisions in a game that their character would make in real life 'cause that's kind of the point i take into consideration that i have shitty charisma whenever i open my mouth i feel like we all try and take into consideration our background and our alignment because that's you know mazes and madness i was gonna say vin diesel felicia's got some that's not cool my scarves are cooler than you personal ooh gotta teach lessons i was a part of a buffy the vampire slayer tabletop rpg for a while yeah it's actually quite fun i was a pyromancer what's our favorite video games oh that's a hard question there's so many sometimes we're playing heroes of the storm more now you'll see maybe next week if you had to trade places with one of us i'd be probably either scanlan or pike bards and clerics are great he hasn't died yet douginator asked me a super detailed question so i don't wanna blow over it 'cause it was awesome he asked me how my path has gone and my personal aramente journey and how working with the group has helped and slowed it down for the air ashari and for keyleth's journey it's kind of expected to take her maybe ten maybe 20 years it takes her like the aramente is expected to take a long time and part of it is her kind of proving herself a hero so she kind of ended up tagging along with this motley crew in order to kind of help her so she's not doing it alone so it's a good thing that she's tagging along but she also has to deal with sometimes the moral dilemma of maybe choices that she might not normally make if she wasn't with the group that she has to go with yeah that was fun i think one of my favorite keyleth moments it wasn't a kill but when we were in the crazy michael jackson neverland ranch sorcerer dude's plane of existence yeah when we were in his plane of existence and we encountered that big tree rock monster and i just happened to take command plants and he happened to be a plant monster so it just worked out perfectly and i was just like we don't wanna fight you back down and avoided an entire battle oh yeah that was a good story burt reynolds just announced that he's gonna be at philly wizard world with us so we could theoretically tell him that story our holiday episode heck yeah the order of the brotherhood of the sisterhood boom sonic boom yeah what's under the lake oh yeah that's right i did write it down yes i was a shark remember 'cause i was like i'm gonna be crafty and turn into a shark and then i started immediately drowning oh yeah grog we still don't know if that-- he might have been an ally we might have killed someone who was valuable ooh that's tough yeah hard of course we do that's the thing i'm gonna say final fantasy 10 it was a big hassle high insurance rates that's cool favorite nerdy t-shirt i've got like an army kind of soldiery looking t-shirt that says chimera like chimera corps i like your displacer kitty you've got any betrayals in the game so you did a little peeping tom dealt a little bit with each person well we know it's named-- what is each person's favorite d&d monster 'cause he confused you right and you just hari-karied off the hole that was when i was a spider tiger 'cause i cast spider climb on myself and i was in tiger form so i was spider climbing all over the place i'm wondering when we're gonna face a beholder that's my favorite d&d monster they're like a big floating head with a giant eye and they've got tentacles with eyes on the end of 'em and each eyeball does a different ray of effect they're nasty they're super awesome one of these days we're gonna fight one yeah who wouldn't want to go to sweden receive an extra level or matt's hair it is 1138 by the way oh right pike dying mansions of madness is great it's a card building game war machine i'm a cryx player seven seconds at a time yeah i think i still have the video of you trying to woo the nymph lady it's basically just you flirting with my boyfriend ballsack do we have nicknames for all of our npcs fastball special that's cool or kill them there's a lot that goes into it i think matt just to put it into perspective for everyone in the chat room i think matt probably spends close to eight hours at least on each time before we play or i guess at least we used to who was it was it you or vex that tried to float down with the carpet and then we realized it was magic but we tried to just use it like a parachute i think it was mainly the twins in the tower let's do a good one waiting for a good one i'm multi-tasking i've just been tightening my laces while i've been kicking it back here dalman that's amazing oh that's good oh yeah i saw your picture i don't know maybe
