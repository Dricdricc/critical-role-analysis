fish dudes oh come on man i can't try to aim to attack-- but i have a bonus action you said i could use flavor for unarmed shit he told me to be flavorful so can i take my actual bonus action to do patient defense did i have any more movement by the by could i have scooched up a bit just a scooch excuse me i've got very long legs right now it tried to run it did want to come home upon seeing fjord get super daze-y can i use my sentinel feat to crack this guy who just tried to attack oh that was awesome doubling the dice that's eight plus four which is 12 plus another dice that's two that's right that's two plus another four sorry that's two doubled which is four so that's 16 damage as he grabs the chain big beau steps on the chain and cracks him right in the face what happens on monday nights fuck but that's all of their turns right except for that motherfucker is it like a life vest yeah yeah and then big me over top of her hi fjord good to see you alive i don't know what you just did but i am so into it okay i'm going to stride forward (large footsteps) ah fuck this is what travis deals with all the time ow through cali's acid mist i'm going to split the air and cut down and do a big slap right on its face i get a little bit of-- it probably gets stuck a little bit but then it gives me a nice little snap okay i'll take that that's enough 19 20 19 i don't know it's enough okay that's nine plus-- ooh 13 the second one knowing i'm going to get stuck on the ceiling i'm going to paddle back and come up and crack with the other end damn it okay 15 plus seven plus-- ten total i'm going to do flurry of blows flurry of beaus that's not great 12 second one is even fucking worse it's a two can i assist for advantage i'm going to take my staff and try the same thing is she all right hey cali oh it does magnet it does actually magnet people are going to suspect things of us trading in manacles all the time these didn't work you have luck oh it was the-- you're so mean so cali i started a conversation earlier which might be why you got so distracted you seem to have such an affinity for cute things is there a reason why you like cute things i'm not saying that not all of us like cute things we all love cute things but you seem to really like cute things i just might appreciate some other things man thank you maybe it's in the next room there's still another room it's true could be a whole network of caverns until we find-- we do have boom boom sticks or like you said we just destroy the entrance to where they can't come through it takes time and equipment i could probably join you for a swim if you want to just swim and back you're going to swim and come back as if i didn't know that coming here that's the worst thing anyone has said about us our job was to secure the safehouse we can collapse this and say job done that changes things maybe run a line have the rope in case what caleb's still holding the bowl can i snatch it out of his hand real quick just a straight dex check it's not great ten i'm playing a game of keep-away (sing-songy) caleb caleb i respect you and all of your intentions but your caution does not get to control other people's destinies you had no intentions of wanting this bowl or needing this bowl or caring about this bowl until cali came around i grab caleb drag him aside hand cali the bowl drag caleb over to a private corner and i say look we all have our fucking trauma you understand that we all have our fucking garbage and our dirt and our shit but you don't get to use your skeletons in your closet your ptsd to be shitty and control other people and what they want it does not make you the authority on what's right and what's wrong just because you think that you're a shitty person guess what we're all fucking shitty people i get feeling like shitty people i don't speak for the rest of these guys but i get feeling shitty but it doesn't mean that you get to impress that on other people and make them feel like shitheads just because you are then she fucking lied to us we take that and we learn that as a lesson for later on yes cali i'm not blaming him it's just that this isn't the first occurrence of something like this with him either i think he is too it's kind of what molly said the road to hell is paved with good intentions that's fair troll and also really big alligators i love you tell them where to find you on high rollers yogscast is great you guys are great the cast is great-- yeah cali
