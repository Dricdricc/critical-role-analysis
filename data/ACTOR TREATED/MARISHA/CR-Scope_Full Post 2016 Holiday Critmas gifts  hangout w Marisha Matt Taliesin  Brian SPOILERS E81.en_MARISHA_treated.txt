favorite group of nerdy-ass voice actors as a token of my appreciation for the hundreds of hours of entertainment critical role has given me i wanted to make something cool for each of you out chainmail to aid you in your quest dice bags are usually the go-to but in my opinion mail dice bags look like used metal condoms-- so instead i decided to skip the bag part and straight up make you some chainmail dice the colors for each dice were chosen specifically with your characters in mind the rings are atomized aluminum and the filling is 999% hypoallergenic polyester these dice were not fair and not in a helpful don't-let-matt-know kind of way either nothing even if you can't use them in game i hope you enjoy these dice as much as i have enjoyed critical role all the best jared hayes
