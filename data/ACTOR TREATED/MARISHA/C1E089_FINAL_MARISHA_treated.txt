promise to her and you've made a promise to me we have to settle down and live happily together remember you promised me vesrah so i want to give you a little bit of light to follow in the darkness and i find the scar on his back of my handprint and i find it and i cast daylight into his back into the hand print and say and besides you know i'm in love with you right (quietly) that's it god damn

hell oh jesus come on yeah you're not kidding that's pretty intense she did it again cotton candy pike glad you're not dead really glad you're not dead i feel like we all need to rest i turn to uvenda grog tary the lodestones yeah good job good job good work oh that's happening tonight oh wow this stuff moves fast yeah for what no it was my negligence in proper planning that added to this i think the landscape of the world has changed a lot recently and i think the aramente should reflect that so i would be honored to provide any insight to help what what do you mean why were we the only ones with the tools recently and none returned i'm sorry yes it is do you mind if we take a brief respite amongst ourselves before we catch up with you and join in the festivities kaitiaki uvenda group hug guys group hug come here tary you too oh that's right you did do that oh boy heal up a bit in case yeah are we all together ooh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah with a-- mm i have something for you all i have presents mm-hm well i had gilmore help me out with a little something for if and when i completed the aramente as a thank you so i got them from him before we left-- granted in hindsight i'm never holding onto presents ever again 'cause we could all just die any day but at least-- yeah like you do but this time it worked out okay and i pull out all the necklaces these are from the dragons we've collected they're dragon-tooth necklaces and i had gilmore enchant a very simple enchantment to each of them so it won't-- you won't have to focus or attune to it-- -- if any one of us goes unconscience-- unconscious if any one of us goes unconscious-- thank you the rest of them will start beating a little heartbeat that way we know if any one of us goes down even if we can't see each other so grog pike and vex yeah i know-- figure we all go unconscious so often-- mm totally had this one made for scanlan think i should hold onto it but here's a flower and i druidcraft him a flower i mean you can-- do you wanna wear it for now you know maybe i should go ahead and just give this to tary i can always have gilmore make another one here tary just you did good you did good here today at least for now i can probably have another made-- oh jeez oh okay-- thank you-- thank you thank you thank you thank you that's-- yeah all right thank-- you're welcome thank you i think you're right i can't take it back from him now or ever i've been thinking about that a lot myself well they don't really tell you much just tell you to go back-- go out into the world and prove yourself a leader with no real definition on what they think a leader should be that is one way you could phrase it yes well that'll be a discussion that i have with korren with my father we're not barbaric we're not-- no one wants to lose anyone on an aramente do you think i'm not empathetic percy do you not think that we have experienced ample amount of pain and loss over the course of this it's not a blood sacrifice it's a tradition it's meant to show us the world and yes it's flawed and i want to fix that ha i don't think my traditions really vary that much from yours which could still be perceived as old-fashioned if you will you know it's interesting percy i've always looked at you and i as that opposites-attract conundrum as my best friend i feel like you are always the natural born leader who has been running away from it ever since i met you and i'm the one who's not as naturally gifted but is racing towards it faster than-- are you all right percy (laughs) (laughs) (laughs) that was awesome yeah i'm in my fancy clothes by the way yeah it's still a little soggy and damp yeah yeah yeah yeah come on toss a drink yeah right as rain what's your definition of bohemian okay i think of the goristro yenk (screams) i turn into a beholder (laughs) i am a golden god (all laugh) i change into-- adult bronze dragon i do a victory lap (whoosh) i turn and-- brass dragons have fire breath right do they have fire breath i do-- into the air i just go (kwoosh) see what happens oh yeah yeah yeah i come back down and i come down and i'm like (animal noises) oh that's right i'm so used to beast shape (all laugh) so i can talk hey guys guys check it out ah ah yeah i'm like ah guys got little antlers this is-- i don't know you wanna go for a ride okay all right i pick up the half-elves and pike yes and i totally spend the next hour giving joy-rides to anyone who wants to dragon rides i leveled up so that's shapechange right i can change into anything that's a challenge rating of my level or lower for an hour adult dragons are yeah (sighs) i wasn't sure if i was ever gonna get here (heavy sigh) yeah i can it's for an hour and i can keep shapechanging into different things for an hour yes i can it's like beast shape so i keep my intellect my wisdom and my charisma but i take on their physical stats-- -- and their abilities yep i know as the spell fades i just give grog a big hug and just kinda cry tears of joy into his chest for a little bit thank you truly thank you i will keep her-- thanks that's all that was a good party that's true i see percy really quick are you still concerned (laughs) wouldn't be you-- i--if you weren't concerned wouldn't be here without you or the others you know that right i can't do this alone and i-- to answer your question from yesterday i think the problem of this aramente is that it shows you the components of what you need to be a leader but being a leader could take a lifetime to master if you even can master such a thing so lots still to go this isn't the end and i hope you stay with me i need you well let's at least go home for now is that okay is that enough for now i feel like once you can turn into a dragon things only get more complicated that's yeah all right let's go it's like a kinder egg there's a toy inside we totally called it we're gathering up anyway we're walking over don't fuck me gil that's not bad 23 rolling with gil i'm not dreaming i'm not dreaming oh jeez oh jeez yeah higher yeah it hurts mama pike yeah (all laugh) (laughs) von muselix an-swer yeah thank you for everything i'm sure we'll be in contact soon kaitiyaki i mean i totally could tree stride us anywhere but i kind of want to take the boat again yeah we paid a lot yeah to emon for now we can go see we also haven't looked at any of the findings from raishan's cave well let's at least get back to emon that's the main port town it's a starting point we're heading to emon so we'll see you there okay no no no she's okay true just let him sleep let him sleep it off i-- if you're interested adella because i'm feeling pretty spiffy after-- okay all right i can control the winds and give us forwards-facing winds for a solid hour if you want you want it you want a little turn this into a speed boat you know see how fast it goes i don't know what this means i've just seen other sailors do it so okay i cast fifth-level control winds i'm going to do just a solid gust behind us for a good hour there's no need for an apology just you being there means everything that means a lot coming from you because i think you're just the coolest i'm sorry if i ever put you or your brother in harm's way or anyone else well thank you what now royalty's a strong word well you're pretty cool yourself all grand mistress nightwatch what's it called whatever i'm glad i found you guys learned a lot from you so thank you she winked at me again now you can wear it he spent the entire time on the boat braiding macrame it was crazy he's getting into beading it's odd (all laugh) no it's great to the keep do you have the papers with you that you pulled from raishan are those with us i'll help you research those all right erwen you're still alive yeah yeah gil he's hotis aw he's too good for us yes he's still alive yes this is where we would have dinner oh and that's a giant portrait of one of our members who you haven't met he made it riding on a unicorn it's great you should show him the basement i do a little gust cantrip to blow it you want another title just give him another title yeah i'll do the reading for percy until he gets his glasses back we're reading papers from raishan's i speak primordial and well primordial druidic sylvan elven grog stole his glasses go easy on him don't say those things out loud did you detect any traps can i do detect magic on it sorry slash raishan's yeah what's your will pike your wisdom can i assist pike in some way since we're both wise as fuck my saving throw modifier is plus 11 -- and my regular modifier is plus six i go up i go up i don't know i don't know this is what you tuned in for okay all right all right if you wanna read it i will go over your shoulder and be on the ready in case anything bad happens it's true fall back into place why what okay nothing weird just air yeah just a draft you are the only ones who can speak abyssal okay all right-- -- hang on hang on who wants to read it i can-- i'll enhance your ability can i do anything-- i just eat the book (laughs) who's reading are you reading i cast enhance ability on her and give her i think it's owl's wisdom (sneezes) we learned that yes it could've huh it gives you advantage on wisdom checks not saving throws you all right can we have doty copy down everything that you just said not actually exact transcriptions just so we keep the knowledge high school notes that doesn't sit well with me we don't here we do in whitestone we were also going to go the cobalt reserve anyway we could see i'm sure they have some sort of a library special secret book vault re-lock it i vote we take it to the cobalt reserve either that or vasselheim one of the two will have options i'm sure okay did we go through all of the papers that raishan and everything had for the most part he mentioned going north and looking for other powerful entities and objects to bind with and then raishan thought it would be a good idea to settle down in whitestone she had an interest in whitestone which makes me wonder what the spinning black orb of death has to do with all of this because i'm still not convinced that it doesn't have some sort of play in everything i'm just you know-- what time is it you all want to rest take the night off head to westruun in the morning we are in the keep you know before we-- brunch definitely matt taliesin and i and maybe others yeah i've been the keeper a couple of times a few though (rough voice) oh hell yeah who can ashcan can you do
