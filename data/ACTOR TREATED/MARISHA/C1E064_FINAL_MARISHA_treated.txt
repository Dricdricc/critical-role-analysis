just don't think about it too much how long have we been gone goddamn it that's horrible for percy you've wanted to go your whole fucking life does the name garmelie ring a bell you titled vex'ahlia it is written on a piece of paper someone wrote it down right show him the paper vex we were committing we were in syngorn little gamey you're going to pull-- screaming in his face what the fuck i pull out the piece of the petrified crocodile we killed this too this is all that's left of him percy i am so sorry i know how badly you wanted to go there but here's the good news now that i've been there we can go back at any time yeah we've been naturally without alcohol yes i could use a glass of wine you had a lovely time we can go back we'll take a lovely vacation i wonder if it has a name and how long does he last he just lives until he's done good doggie jarett so it is like saturday here right time runs the same so it wasn't yesterday when did they leave haven't seen him in a while jarett has there been any eyes on the green dragon here recently okay thank you do we know where okay thank you same same to you asum i'm so sorry that's our home wyvern i heard wife wait his wyvern guard is often oh that's still me manufacturing shit okay do we have any known whereabouts on the white or the green dragon she's on my shit list what did he just say what is this just with a simple scrying spell okay yes and as we've learned before scrying can alert your position oh my god i turn to cassandra we need to get all of the citizens underground immediately i go out and i do a skywrite in the sky again they already know we're here making pictures in the clouds right above the city it's fine and what about the citizens do it by hand we might not have that much time they're coming this way fuck 26 it's thordak's army asum said himself we're eastward we're directly in its path dragons have truesight they already know we're here any second we wait longer more people could die percy percy percy you have five seconds to come up with a better fucking plan or i am doing it it's clear they're not deviating the path i would throw up the de rolo crest just like before it's a good alert sign then come up with a better damn plan percy they're scouting us okay i go to the cavern under the sun tree and i start casting move earth and i start clearing it as fast as i can as fast as i can fallout cavern style big lower bigger lower what do you mean the fucking ziggurat i go the other way fallout style little pods hi pike sorry maybe you can look at his head later percy are you sure it's okay for me to let these people out i start slowly releasing people from the pods i go up to percy i hope you know that i would never-- i thought that draconia's on a whole another continent four left because we have whisper right so there's five yeah yes a lot are there a lot of-- at least all of our guards from emon are in syngorn right not our personal guards but emon's guards there's also the ashari druids who will definitely want to help our cause i can spend more time fleshing out and reinforcing the bunkers to make them-- yeah the black one umbrasyl is the one that's-- black ones like torture right we left our names and just as much as we can scry on them they can scry on us i'm sure they've been watching us judging based on what happened in emon we know that they have an insider we just don't know who yet during a council meeting someone probably very high up hey travis how is it you're on this side of the table scanlan and i will share one no well he's here now so fire plane's probably safer the city of brass is in the plane of fire we've covered that the city is in the plane of fire ank'harel is on the continent of-- what's it's called what's the continent i suddenly blanked on it you just said it marquet it's on the continent of marquet also another plane of existence that's in the nine hells months but we also don't want to wait until-- but the ozmit sea is where the water ashari reside and i have to go there anyway it's also where pike is very familiar i'm pretty sure that's the sea that she sailed whisper the blade elsewhere you mentioned about having our own mole at one point our own inside man and i agree we might not be able to wait to get them all before we start taking on dragons we might want to do both and first level characters which we are not pitting the dragons against each other yeah he's right there or we can always teleport i can tree stride i can always tree stride i can scry and look at a tree whatever they all sound the same i can scry look at a tree and then we go through that tree i'm hoping there's a tree on that continent when you're scrying on dragon yeah the tree doesn't know it's being spied on do you remember us walking into the town center to kill kevdak that wasn't sneaky yeah we pull the trigger on one we pull the trigger on all of them we can't really stroll up to it and be like-- we are very good at picking fights it's getting the dragons to pick fights on others we've got to think about it breeding hostility between the two is something that could take weeks which we don't have but how it literally involves going to one dragon and saying hey did you hear what that other dragon said about you that's all i got wait hang on that first thing you said i think i might have an idea okay we know the white dragon is vain what yeah you went to 11 there on let's start continuing the genocide but we need to get something started here's what we learned at dawn we drink some more we learned that thordak is enslaving sculptors to build his image all around emon what we have learned is it seems that each of the dragons have picked a city a domain maybe this domain was part of the bargain to join thordak's cause help me you get your own city so i bet the white dragon would be real pissed off if statues of thordak started popping up around draconia or the green dragon and didn't we see something similar in umbrasyl's and when we killed the blue yeah remember it cracked and it was like i'm coming for you and we were like we don't know what that means and we ignored it i said we start planting statues of thordak or raishan in other dragons' territories ultimately though what we need is we need someone who knows the dragons' weaknesses we need to know what pushes their buttons well because we know that thordak is definitely vain and we're assuming-- sorry-- that they'll ask instead of jumping to conclusions and we wonder why people hate us hashtag team vorugal is ank'harel and the ozmit sea in the same area can we hit one on our way to the other we could do a triple because i have to get to the water ashari at some point we're on tal'dorei what is plant some seeds what time is it i have an idea thank you can you seeming us to all look like lizard army members we fought them on the airship too right to get as many innocents out as we can i figured if we find good fighters once again and do our tree our teleport thing-- but it could be the 13 people that could change the tide that's what i'm saying i don't think that's a good idea well here's something else i want to put into perspective if i scry and teleport us to the black dragon's lair i can do one more scry and then i would burn my seventh level spell to get us there again and then i'd be tapped out we wouldn't be able to bamf out that day we'd be staying the night i could not teleport us it depends on how many times i've got two teleports so i can teleport us there and teleport us out but we'd be doing it from here i used plane shift i didn't use transport via plants yes wait no i moved earth i can't do it today it has to be tomorrow and if that's the case it's tomorrow then we lose that two-day grace period unless we go right now and sleep overnight in draconia and start first thing in the morning yeah i'm saying i cast plane shift from the feywild to here that's all i'm saying but i used that and that's a seventh level spell we're getting a lot of cons there's not so many pros there's also no guarantee that they're going straight back there maybe they're heading somewhere else they were heading with an army to somewhere it's probably not a city they've already conquered balls then where did they come from what were they doing we came up with nothing all right let's sleep let's go to the castle do i hear vax go to his room i'm waiting to hear vax go to his room i go to sleep protector and growth basically an irish breakfast speaking of friends we should probably check up on ours we haven't heard anything about him i know he's hard-headed enough so all of those things are very true you're starting to make less and less sense percy aye where's that coin we have okay 20 is marquet and a one is draconia we can make ourselves look like dragonborn with seeming we can go to umbrasyl's lair but it'll take an extra day because i can only teleport us so many times hold on a second we have two choices if we're going to draconia we can either go to umbrasyl's lair to scry from there then teleport there which means we will be staying the night in draconia in draconia well i'd scry they could theoretically if we get caught okay i have the map of draconia let me just see if i can scry-- no we don't know if he's in draconia i know of the things that tiberius has told us i don't need to have a known location right i can just scry in a general area yeah lockheed has a higher chance of being dead than tiberius well this could answer our question if i can't find anybody then we might be going to marquet i guess it's tiberius then he's all i got it's got to be someone that i know it can't be something i've heard about are we gambling on tiberius being there i am gambling on whoever we scry to because they could all be dead theoretically four times that's right you've got that goddamn thing give me the stone thank you it doesn't go away right yeah let's do this start with tiberius can i try it will it expend another spell it lasts for ten minutes oh per spell yeah i'm burning my own spells it makes me very nervous i'm going to try lockheed his dad could be in a place where he's being watched do i find any trees 19 does it appear to be natural and large enough to fit grog yeah one of those any other trees is this the biggest or closest one how big is the ravine how deep is it not a good option did it look like a natural cavern or a man-made cavern that lockheed was in like he found a little cave and is hiding oh he's on the side of the ravine they could be citizens they could be creatures i just saw movement of figures i didn't see any details this is ridiculous bungee-jumping out of a tree this is the stupidest-- i didn't see draconia i saw the ravine and it was snowy so we can assume it's nearby but i didn't see draconia did i but did i see a city in my scry once again lockheed could have flown miles away all right fuck it let's do it are we going to tie ourselves to each other again like before oh this is such a stupid idea this is stupid this is so stupid we've done so many fucking stupid things but this is really stupid i cast transport via plants on that big fatty tree everyone ready taliesin and oh that's not too bad 22 i cast a grasping vine to grab grog can i look too can i do a nature check to see if i can see the origin the epicenter of the storm like the eye of the storm where it's coming from 16 i think the dragon's lair is that way you said it was a mile can we traverse through the bottom of the ravine to get there in that direction he was the odd man out stealthily that means thordak was here they attacked the cities as a horde i thought you said ash i'll join in too i don't do insight checks too often i'm sorry 22 is this all being said in draconic my tail's gone bummer but i enjoyed it that's a cool title tooma it is not a tumor i could work with that can i get a sense on when this was carved if this was carved recently or if this has been here a while ooh 27 tiberius never mentioned this side of draconia no tails hi totally have a plan come again sabotage from the inside we kill this one it'll set off a chain reaction that we might not be able to recover from if we're not fully prepared we're a motley crew to be fair what guarantee do we have that you won't kill us and the ambush was meant for us i believe there is untrust on both sides i think faith and trust are not mutually exclusive i can not trust you and still have faith and you should not feel lack of pride for living in the dirt or surviving there's nothing wrong with that but i understand your urge to want to rebuild become the great culture that i know you all are so you should at least trust that we have similar interests in the end ooh 19 opal's back 25 we can give you that word is she talking about me that's awesome is that his name i know always sucks going west to east yeah i'm paying attention to the trees that's the biggest tree that's now closest to us now that's the biggest tree that's now closest to us now that one 28 natural fucking 20 the ears have walls it's buried by ice but that doesn't mean it doesn't work the ravenites do we have to use the orb all right hang on let's think about this for a minute yeah let's do that ravenites he might that's what i was thinking maybe this isn't about destroying something maybe it's about planting something if we destroy anything the dragon's going to immediately blame the locals i could leave trees we also have this scrying eye can i use this remotely this might be something we go to the slayer's take for they always have a roster of big beasts wow that's soon i will leave you with a parting gift i will leave you with a grove of trees that should be ever-growing and present he will one i can plant these trees anywhere just need solid ground i can possibly do it subterranean where does the dragon not tread where do you know he will not see the trees we can't even pretend like he was our friend his home was with us i start melting ice i take and i rip off a piece of his robes tuck it away keyleth drops to her knees and starts crying he was so stupid he should have never left our side i follow percy let's go home back to whitestone yeah i do plant growth make a big old tree wherever we decided it was best to create the tree i give the sun tree a little pat knock on vax's door can i stay with you tonight i just go in i need a stiff drink yay
