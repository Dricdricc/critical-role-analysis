your employer overruled me kord or card or chode he likes it when you're super chill and casual with him so be cool (mouths) just go with it that's pretty chill yeah you know that intimate hug we had earlier kinda do that it's part of the initiation the tree appreciates it if you could maybe potentially help me meat man why were you just talking like the meat man you've been there were there trees they looked dead they were dead like very dead i think so right would you prefer to be a cloud i could be a cloud but i'm gonna blow a 7th-level spell for it ten let me see but i've already used my 6th-level spell to transport via plants that's what i'm saying so i'm gonna have to use a 7th-level spell to do it so we can do that but then we might wanna rest or we can do some scouting take a look i won't be completely tapped out ready ready everybody join hands join hands join hands poof does it look like it's natural decay how far-- we're still clouds starting to go into the entrance are we going to go on foot from here i'll wait 'til we get closer from up here does the mountain formation look like it's naturally formed or like some sort of other event is it seismically formed oh not good what's my nature okay 16 happy accidents does it look deliberate or does it look natural natural 19 from gil 22 cover for me i'm gonna drop down and do a commune with nature can lionel and i commune together and do bonuses can i be like can you call your ducks all right you know it's okay how deep is the cave-in that's a good one that's a good one yeah yeah yeah you know i have a similar problem when i try to talk to cows they have face-blindness is there another entrance into this cavern are there other entrances is that two including this entrance well there is another one it's good it's fine it's good in fact i can double down on this can i now do my commune with nature and see if i can map out this cavern and find the other entrances where are the other two entrances to this cavern can i-- hang on-- around the path okay how deep is the ziggurat from here can i sense the other ziggurat okay what else what's the last one what should i do yeah yeah yeah can i sense any other maraudering douchebags humanoids what about humanoids shit do they look like cultist-y people what i don't know i said there's all these cool cult people yeah they could leave a decent amount of people a lot of people there's another entrance nearby i think further down this path it's close what what do you mean she went where i think there's also an entrance at the top of this spire if we want to do a downward approach but that seems risky you know i think it's right around that direction follow the gasping it feels like it's really close to the gasping i wonder if there's another face behind the cave-in wait into the cave-in or the illusory wall i can dispel magic still well there is a second entrance one is up top i can clear out the cave-in i imagine if someone is trying to cause an intentional cave-in they're anticipating no one going through that cave-in and we can start there but they do know about the up he said there was a face hang on hang on there are three entrances the cave-in the one where vex just got exploded and one through the top of the spire if we go through the cave-in entrance i can clear it out i will clear one of my last high-level spells but lionel knows his way through that way but i can clear it tonight can we camp out inside oh my god we have the mansion oh no maybe this is the unused entrance maybe the cave-in is the more recent i could attempt it i have dispel magic with me right now all right i'll do it i'm trying to dispel the magic i'm having vex be like tell me where it is can i prepare it so as soon as i poke my head in i can be like (dink) (poof) bail bail bail out can i peek my head back in and do a 26 i'll go like snow or ash can i dip down and grab a bit of it and do a nature check on it is it ash 15 can i just do a little i'm going to scoop up a little bit and say percy can i get a little bit of water added onto this can i do another nature check on what this is i get down on my hands and elbows where are they i scootch a few more inches and use my last two 3rd-level spells just my straight modifier don't fuck me gil okay that's good that's good 19 on the first one 18 on the second one okay we're good natural 19 yeah that's a 34 total you guys go i'll wait here just in case holy shit a brand new tesla is coming this way okay hey we have people we have people coming this way about six of them just letting you know probably going to be some fighting coming up and that is your update from the voice of the tempest it's not a bad idea we can hold them off and percy i'm just going to say pike pike i think we've got some undead coming our way probably going to need some divine smiting as i call pike i'm going to go ahead and be like here we go (boom) fireball i can see them right they're close enough okay out of the spire okay fireball is hang on wait i'm not a sorcerer i should've had this prepared i admit i should've had this it's something d8 d10's fireball 8d6 fire damage one two three four five six give me two more a 19 and a 20 that's a lot 21 yeah i reroll ones (counting) 34 damage we're here hey pike hold that order for that divine smiting we're going to need it probably in a second i think there's going to be more (singing) scanlan open the door how hot does a campfire normally get not that hot right oh no something bad hey pike fire fire is very white white fire okay it's been a while you've redecorated only salads i take all the mirrors off the roof of our bedroom while he talks with scanlan and then we go to sleep i assume we're okay we have pike not all skeletons are like ducks can we put some rum in it to a pina colada but we have a sound guy who's like-- that's what sound guys do i approve of this so hard happy 100th wait did you frame it like a coupon book that's very impressive like a couple on valentine's day who forgot it was valentine's day does it sound like skeletons or heavier we're inside a glowing door i think they know where we are no one's home we're out of candy no trick-or-treating 24 table right is hanging back behind the twins oh new chest we could put our blankets in it i was going to say the quilt from your grandmother while they drag the bodies back percy and i take the robes can i study one of the guys' face and take that for alter self yeah yeah it's aged a little wait does that require attunement there's a codeword 29 20 total no one's rolled initiative no one knows we're here yet if you can wait 60 seconds i can make us an elemental that's a good question i have a mild confession and maybe i should have said this a little earlier but i'm going to say it now one night i might have sneaked down into the middle of the ziggurat and i stuck my hand in it well i wanted to find out what would happen and i found out it's real bad it's really bad is what i found out and it nearly crushed my hand to a point of oblivion and i think i got really lucky so i think it just crushes anything that it tries to suck in it is i think your arrow happened to be tiny and fast that's all i mean don't jump in i wanted to summon an elemental i go with percy since we have the robes over top of us natural 20 if only it was for something a little more important but it's fine 22 tied with scanlan oh god okay i am going to under the cult hood that i have transform my face with alter self into sylas briarwood her husband her dead husband i'm going to have his face and i'm going to walk forward and say delilah don't it is me deception this is not good i'm not good at this shit oh that's not bad 14 that's it 14 that's all i got 14 is good for me movement and a bonus (sighs) i am going to take my bonus to ignite my form into a fire elemental and rush towards the closest thing to me yeah i don't know where are we okay i have a 50-foot movement i want to hit as many skeletons as i can by running through them and catching them on fire what am i against hit yep so five miss no hit armor class is 13 miss miss hit yep i can take it i'm into this i can fire hover is that including me or no okay can keyleth clothesline him on the way up as a fire elemental hits hits 13 is my armor class 11 so i'm at 52 so 19 points total that brings me exactly to zero i drop form just form i tanked that motherfucking fight y'all i'm still on the ceiling right scanlan ceiling and floor yeah 23 okay how many people are still on the ceiling with me okay i drop form i'm going to look around and go (nervous laughter) and drop my staff and do fire storm radiating out from me and i want to try and avoid lionel and grog but basically radiating out fire floods the ceiling everyone but the two skeletons no fuck the casters what a dick i get to reroll ones (counting) 26 roll two more 12 more damage what did i just say 26 plus 12 more 38 damage can i move any can i back out of wherever i am where am i i'll stay let me back out of it yeah yeah it's okay i'm fine no bitch this is my karma i might be able to do a greater restoration on you but i don't know if i can help you there it was a restoration spell you've always ever said that the blackguard yeah what fucking spell is this four skeletons on me miss we're upside-down on the ceiling i'm like you know how to spell lionel i'm so impressed how much do i get be aggressive don't fuck me gil ooh that's not great i'm going to go ahead and roll my inspiration that's better 12 i'm okay i'm all right how much 31 i can fix it just give me a hot second who's left on the ceiling with me two skeletons that's it and one fucking cultist oh my god a lot of things have changed in a hot second okay what's going on right now where's delilah i mean why not go big or go home i'm going to burn my 9th-level shapechange and go i'm going to go red dragon and that's all i can do right i'm a dragon on the ceiling he does he had to pack a lot of stuff because of me i feel mildly guilty can i move (impacts) giant dragon walking on the ceiling and then look down at delilah backwards and upside down and say hello no yes yeah i do i can't see her i have frightful presence for anyone who might be terrified of me that's it what's that against 19 versus wisdom save they went into the thing they're gone forever if she went in the tiny thing i still have shapechange for another hour wait did she cancel my spell or is it just the orb that's done so what what so it's only a dark magical anti-magical field because she wants it to be which means-- she can change it so it's just very strong magic which makes her change what it is all of their magic was necromantic i can wait before we go pike does sarenrae know anything about this anything is it just like this now like the ziggurat in whitestone the last time i put my hand in the sphere when it was black it nearly tore me apart we could try again keyleth goes over to pike and puts her palm on her head and casts greater restoration the amount you've saved us it's nothing i've learned it from you no sorry i was answering a different question continue what time is it 1241 oh my god a lot to unpack there the eight characters on this side of the table
