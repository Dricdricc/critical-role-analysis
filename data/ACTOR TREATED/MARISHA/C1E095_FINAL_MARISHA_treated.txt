why am i not surprised what's that it's actually going to play during the break yeah yeah yeah you'll like it so stick around haley joel osment also your date with matt mercer in a silk robe thanks to brian wayne foster will be up on youtube tomorrow at 10am is that okay brought peace to the world forever nothing bad will ever happen again for anyone who's watching this is like abduction how to not-- 101 self-defense it's just it looked ominous that's true remember that guy five-letter words is a big deal does he get exhausted from reading if he gets mentally exhausted from reading takes a point of exhaustion when he tries to read does he still have fassbender some tree bark that keyleth made definitely bear claws yeah out of whitestone of course we should just do this tomorrow we should do it tomorrow yeah plus small-business tax breaks it was good all the way around what chief yeah since keyleth-- the mantle's a little heavy and flashy and a little formal to wear all the time but wanted something to still represent my chiefdom keyleth goes hard yeah no i got the traditional ashari tattoos of the mantle across her chest and shoulders to mimic that it took a while it's old needle-and-hammer style all traditional see he got the antlers okay so once again lot of intertwining starting to go on got our tattoos took a little bit of time one of the big things that keyleth did over the course of the year which took a massive majority of her time was she went on a diplomacy mission to all four of the tribes as well as emon and whitestone and with the help of percy and tary we came up with a system that we are calling the crisis orbs system is what you called it where we put magical orbs in each of the cities that are basically giant panic beacons and each city got assigned a separate color to where if anything goes terribly wrong someone can hit that beacon and all of the crystals will light up and whoever can respond first will do so it's like how calling 911 is illegal you don't do that you don't do that yes 'cause keyleth does definitely-- keyleth and a lot of the other ashari dealt with a little bit of guilt after cinderking thordak and wanted to make sure that if anything tragically goes wrong again we can potentially be faster to respond and have allies nearby so that was a massive part of it i also went to whitestone and grabbed a little sprig off of the sun tree to propagate one of my own trees back in vesrah spent a lot of time working on my alchemy in between i imagine we have would have crafting parties in whitestone yeah and then you know i would do some alchemy yeah yeah it was great it was great and he made dragon armor took trips with vax and had him as my right-hand man sir vax the gothy one such a good show no we were the ones that could correct sorry the royal troupe of the-- taliesin and tropical vacation did she get a dope crown mantle sisters that's right that's right and we inform him that we buried his wife's ashes yes yes okay percy do your thing do we come back in like two weeks he'll call okay is this like a-- do we wait here i use it to affix my mantle you helped me unify the world globally you know i've crafted him some oils with some herbs he's good i helped him manscape a bit it's good wait are we sailing or are we bamfing and we didn't go sailing with pike do you have like a racial advantage to find a place like this teach us your upper-white-male ways oh my god yeah we might hop around aaa discounts (laughter) that's fair we never spend money on ourselves yeah keyleth runs out and goes who wants to go scuba-diving 'cause i can water breathe us and we can go look at the coral reefs okay we do that we do that at some point throughout the week it's like the bermuda triangle i turn to pike and vex and go hey hey underwater tea party can i look for shark's teeth that's fun can i do a nature check 17 cool tattoo's looking good though you know salt water is bad for the armor right you

ocean dogs beach dogs you tell us man what the fuck man what is he throwing away i don't think he's very sanitary we catch up on so much gossip we shouldn't test the fates let's flip a coin (laughter) i've got one on hand right now beotches here it is moving on from that scene before they change their mind oh rad can i go check in with the sun tree while i'm here i come up and say hey sun tree casting speak with plants of course hey it's been so long you're looking so good so healthy yeah have you been working out sure yeah how's it been whitestone seems so much better seems happier has morale been up yeah yeah do the kids sometimes climb in you do you like that no oh right really should i put a do not climb sign on you would you like that no i could stake it in the ground around you okay anything to make you more comfortable man yeah oh thanks anyway is there anything else that you need any new news anything going on right thought that winter would last forever right oh yeah but you're still good oh you know keeping busy keeping on keeping on you know it's been good you're like the coolest person i know and you're a tree it's weird even after a year it's like talking to an old friend it's good oh look some of these flowers are getting a little pink sun tree no that's all it's actually getting a little awkward now it's gone on for a little long i just wanted to make sure you were cool yeah awesome okay i'll see you around bye i'll wait for him to text me first yeah it's the rule long time owners does she walk past the sun tree when i'm having a random conversation with no one rolling really shitty tonight let's see what happens oh that's good that's much better straight perception 30 it's about that time i'm like okay bye sun tree and then i'm going to beast shape into a crow and start circling her poop on the way up jb keyleth flies down and lands on pike's shoulder i bamf out of my beast shape whoa what you sent money you've told us very vague amounts about your family it was surprising you haven't talked about them too much just that they're shady you know we love you and family or not if anyone tries to fucking use you we will-- all right i just don't want anyone taking advantage of you have you kept in contact with any of them until recently here and i dab her brow off a little do you need anything do you need anything to look cool okay i pull out my oils that i use on vax here you go you're good much better did he say weeks did he slip that in can i assist him on that individuals 26 i'm a guest foreigner just like you passing through traveling on can i insight check that i don't trust your married in this bullshit shit 20 total we could always go hunting for our dinner classic way i just don't like it when people try to take advantage of my friends but they're family and if anyone is in need i don't want to potentially put them out we can just keep an eye out i'm protective i say to vax just keep an eye on the odd one all right it's a charlie brown thanksgiving popcorn and keyleth goes-- ashley if she looks over at me i'm going-- freaky friday i check my pouch and make sure my antlers are still there and i liked seeing you being bested regardless of the people it's still fun seeing you being bested no premonitions of a curse from wilhand hang on i don't mean to question everything but wilhand defected from the whole family and became a cleric but he never mentioned anything of a curse why did he become a cleric that seems like a dichotomy there or he's terrified of some superstitious curse maybe both that's accurate i can get us anywhere very quickly i think it would be a half-and-half situation and wilhand is the brother of ogden wilhand's older than ogden i thought ogden was as old as life itself he had a mick jagger lifestyle all right all right maybe you could do a grog tour and then a percy tour the two masters of the city of course and this was my first hook-up and this was the scene of my second hook-up sprinting from the airport bamfing we're all a year older now we're older
