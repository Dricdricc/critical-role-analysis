back in alfield this is where bryce lives right we should check in with bryce shift pods hey thadeus is bryce in broad barn i'm finding a bunch of old dumb jokes this isn't where we left-- no this isn't where we left reginald no okay to be fair i don't remember him sometimes they aren't regular though-- sometimes they're undead ones yeah but we fought both what are you doing here you working here now yeah this might have been the first town we did good because we kind of got a guy– arrested and thrown in jail for-- came through in the black not broken even ey yeah totally know exactly what you're talking about soot and dirt yeah wait when did this happen yeah that's when dairon decided to go right or was she already out there sorry yeah how is the starosta is he still a pain in the ass what's the best penis you've ever seen i still want that question answered but he can go ahead what's the matter even if she hadn't seen them voyeuristically-- why are you so interested in people's sex lives caleb yeah what's your best dick oh did we scare them away oh god question what was the name of the town that gustav is stuck at it's the next one we're in alfield that's where i stole mail okay i was getting confused if we were in-- okay cool do you guys want to stop in down in trostenwald on our way you know we have a little bit more money now maybe we could help gustav out a little bit the last good thing that we could do i'm sure he would also like to know about molly you know i never really thought about the fact that when you're with someone when they die it's kind of your responsibility for forever to tell anyone who doesn't know what happened that kind of sucks so let's keep sharing bad news that's true no furthest south i've been i think is trostenwald yeah you could continue your swimming lessons sure let's just do that what you're really good firstborn maybe they're a trail marker let's go knock them over are we near where the gnoll mine was oh we found a few of those bags what if it's a trap can you do that ritual on the cart as we drive away eight find another geocache come on ooh yeah maybe that's the guy we're hiding in the invisible cart yeah why don't we stop by the nestled nook see who's there same for me i flag down adla adelaine (laughter) yeah i was curious if you've seen gustav around tall thin elvish-looking man i thought he was working off his debt i thought he was-- right interesting all right thanks another round of drinks oh well i didn't have you around for a little bit keeping me in check i tried to do okay though i think i did all right did i do okay caleb never mind what time is it sure no so generous great for cats maybe we can wheel and deal with him pay a lump sum now and consider it debt repaid time served that's right hi (ambiguous noises) well you don't know him caduceus what the hell and where are you getting all of this insight i'm not arguing prison politics-- i agree with you i just feel like there's a supernatural situation going on here that you're not necessarily telling us how much she wanted to do 1700 i throw in 165 that's molly's but also hang on before we do all this listen norda i know we caused a lot of a headache for you when all this was going down so we're simply trying to take one more headache off of your list of a lot of headaches we're trying to do a good thing a man in jail doesn't do anything for your city but i bet 1500 right now would don't have to feed him think of what you can do for this town with 1500 gold right now because let me tell you we can't give you that 1700 so we either walk and you're stuck with a prisoner for another nine months or you take the 1500 jazz hands hey natural 20 yeah jazz hands work every fucking time 17 all right how much was it i've got 165 that was molly's i can throw in money as well because that was part of my goal okay maybe you could find her we're heading to the menagerie coast you're more than welcome to hop on the wagon if you want can't promise much more beyond that do you mean that like if we ever need you can we hit you up yeah but i'm asking because he offered i don't need you right now yeah okay fjord does this mean i'm not the most abrasive person in the group any more i toss caduceus a little pouch that's what's left of molly's gold 65 figured since you put down so much money for a stranger to be busted out a little bit of reimbursement why why'd you do it that's a lot of money for an esoteric reason 400 gold oh 65 i was gonna toss in way more but you guys picked up the check she just was like i'm out right out the front door dpb yes ooh i do my pushups and my pullups i'm working on it beau works out more than i do peanut butter i'll drive for a bit i haven't taken a shift yet to the what
