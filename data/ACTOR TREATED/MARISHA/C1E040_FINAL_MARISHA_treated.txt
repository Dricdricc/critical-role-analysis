which we could have waited and celebrated 50th episode but fuck it 40 it is are you going to be raising arizona we haven't plugged them in a while our wonderful charity that we support 826la go check them out there's still a huge portion of our proceeds that go to 826la every week and-- well they tutor children through the ages of kindergarten and 18 because kindergarten is an age and help in creative writing and storytelling and they also have cool store fronts all the way across the country there's one in like san fran i know there's one in new york i think there's one in seattle yes yeah if you have an 826 in your area you should go there and tutor and you should be like 'hey' you should go to there and you should tutor to there and you should introduce d&d to them run a d&d game for kids it's very fulfilling what was it called again ashley all those people can we see anything from here i'm at 32 so same thing we should get inside anyways we don't know what all is safe right now why don't we all head down there what are the voices speaking i figured we'd all be moving outside at least keyleth stands in the middle of the foyer unable to move feeling that i snap out of it and run to the south exit of the castle to look for the explosion does keyleth see all of this natural 20 22 22 where am i in regards to everyone else oh okay okay i want to use my movement to get under that tree yeah let me-- no towards the entrance-- heading for cover yeah and now i'm going to cast fog cloud at fourth level which makes it a radius of 80 feet if you cast it at higher levels it goes up by 20 feet for each level higher you cast it so i'm casting it at fourth level okay so i go all storm for a second get all misty-eyed and i want to create a nice low-level fog across the whole castle well i want to make it like a fog cloud over top so we're blinded by-- yeah so we're blocked from the dragon as we flee i hope you guys weren't wanting to shoot at it by the way that's it well i moved wait it skids to a halt right there i'm not going to roll that many dice always a good sign does that lead to our keep oh god okay i'm afraid of everything-- i'm afraid if i throw up a wall of stone or anything like that he'll be able to be like oh i'm a fucking dragon so i'll go to the other side of the wall here's what i'm going to do i'm going to start running towards the keep start running towards the keep i'm going to go ahead and cast conjure woodland beings and i'm going to summon a giant eagle this is dropping my fog cloud since that was real fucking useful i'm gonna conjure it right on the other side of him where it's-- i can then have it do an attack correct in the same turn i command it to go for its eyeballs oh right he's attacking right right he has talons that was more of a distraction conjure woodland beings it's a 4th-level spell it was a 19-- oh wait plus five is 21 it rolled a 20 okay it rolled a 21 on its attack go eagle go right in the eyes yeah 2d-- so that's 11 plus three-- 14 points of damage it's supposed to be a distraction all right-- and then i use a bonus action to be like everyone inside great 23 heroes' feast that what i was about to ask are we fighting or are we running who's not feared if we're running i don't want to bust out my good shit we can go down-- inside anyways tickles is this umbrasyl does he refer himself as umbrasyl no the red dragon is this because of us it's too long it's too late i follow pike into the temple i back into a corner in the temple and collapse into a corner i wander over to pike and just i grab her hand as i watch donate to 826la is something wrong okay wait did you close the door i put my ear to the door can i hear them a little bit (yelling) wait who wanted who what hearing vax unload that information if i reach through the crack in the door can i touch grog like my tiny little female hand i reach through and if i can grab grog i cast hold person on him well-- then we can push him over right there's three of us we can push real hard oh wait wait can i redact that can i redact that beautiful-- even better is he trying to bamf in scanlan while she pushes can i get up against the crack to see if i can see through while she pushes are we trying to hand grog the evil things what does this mean the door flies open there are dragons outside and we're fighting playing rugby with a fucking skull the rest of us see this now right keyleth cracks her staff on the floor and does a gust cantrip and goes (whoosh) to make a big burst of wind in the room silence pike you sure about this can i get a spell off on him is it rolling at my feet can i get a spell off what the fuck is happening seeing all of this happen i cast hold person at 4th-level against percy grog-- how far away are they can i turn around and see-- what about vax vex vex sorry vex can i say something everyone stop why are we fighting we just watched our city burn to the ground what are we fighting over what does this look like what does this look like to you everyone get in percy's workshop and we're going to talk this out i would if any of my fucking party would for once tell me something you all didn't tell me the full fucking story when we went back into general krieg's house and now look what happened look what happened because you assholes aren't communicating shut up percy (laughter) this is because of us and you all know it is let's figure this out go pike (laughter) oh my god it's allura and kima can we all please go back in percy's workshop why not we are standing in the damn hall all i am asking is that we move into a quiet room they call themselves the chroma conclave i'll go ahead and drop the hold person on percy the cloudtop district has been demolished we don't know who all is alive or dead we can only expect the worst yes but we used our wish to wish ourselves out of that contract we can destroy more if we're not careful what do we do there was one of each color all colors except for blue of the chromatic spectrum i got a few of their names does this sound familiar to you there's a white dragon that called himself vorugal a green dragon raishan black dragon umbrasyl and the red dragon we haven't heard his name yet he seems to be the leader he had a message that he belted over the entire city he said that we who live he's showing mercy and that we can either fight or flee and then-- okay something along those lines and then he said that it was the guardians of this city that brought this upon emon and that he has control he called it like a new order thordak we did but it sounds like he has been my people-- our job is to guard these realms yeah yeah oh god oh god what if they're-- what if they're dead oh my god this is all my fault but wait we fought-- we fought my elders we fought the headmaster my people would they be okay yeah what do you know of general krieg you were on the council with him do you know anything further allura would you consider us guardians of this city is this because of us a blue dragon i reach out and i grab vax's hand they spoke out to us maybe two years ago i need to check in with my people i need to check in with the air ashari yeah this is an annihilation think allura what do all these cities have in common and what would be the benefits of taking over these cities do you think they just want domination over people over us they called us ants there has to be something more that they want i need to reach out to the ashari and see if they're-- i leave i want to go-- well actually allura will you help me in a scrying spell i want to scry and first check in on the fire ashari do i see cerkonos it destroyed everything they killed everyone we failed my people failed we failed our cause i'm not as strong as you allura yes that's my people aye yeah i stand d&d will never be fun again everything's ruined back when things were so much simpler ah yes thank you it's so porous what time is it it's ten o'clock and we ended on time and-- i'm going to find a corner to rock back and forth in i was more afraid of us wishing ourselves out of existence i wish there were no more dragons and no more people and no more-- and it turns out that it was just a fucking lame-ass pirate fuck that we don't want to be indebted to some shithead pirate she would have walked in and we're beating the shit out of each other i wish i was a woman does this mean i'm the last druid to make the aramente i'm wondering about the other locations though too we have a lot of phone calls like i-- theoretically wiped my people off the face of the planet if they all busted through--
