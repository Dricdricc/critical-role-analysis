yeah we have updated stuff the main thing that has changed on the spire of conflux is that i now gain plus one bonus to spell attack rolls and my spell save dc increases by one yes it is and yeah and as always 826la is amazing and there might be a local branch in your city i know there's one in san francisco i know there's one in new york i know there's one in chicago yeah it's amazing did you ever listen to any of the first playlists that we put out thank you for your click on the geek and sundry website i guess you yay stocking stuffers and it's all embroidered okay they're all going to the city are we still down by the ziggurat are we going to have a meeting spot outside of emon we should probably have a plan so we probably want different regiments flanking the city in different areas percy do you still have that map of emon that he drew the short straw we drew the short straw for him once again percy i feel like that's small picture-- 24 hours left alive they're redirecting to emon uh-huh yeah it's a giant balloon in the air-- i always think of it as a high-tech hindenberg wait have we rested and then we teleported no allura brought us here hang on i can scry on our keep we're not really in good standing with them you think i guess sure it's like seeing that person you hated in high school after something terrible just happened happy for the familiarity sure and it's a little gratifying it lasts for 24 hours this is the worst of two extremes is anyone still there wasn't it drexel dranzel we have friends of our own okay hang on let me scry on the keep this will answer plenty of questions and then we'll go from there did we leave laina there did we leave anyone there or is it completely vacated i can't scry on a building correct i can't scry on a building can i scry on a plant one that i've had personal communications with that's what i want to scry on i want to start there you know how it's always you zoom in really fast and you zoom in really fast-- can i slow down i can't pull focus it's the worst okay where not near the ziggurat if we're still there i like presents do the trees look overgrown do the plants look overgrown and the temple is intact it looks like the keep is still intact from where we rebuilt it do i sense any movement i rolled two ones both ones i'll say that's just flushing it out i hate it when the vr goggles short out (laughter) shit good scry guys good scry it's still standing for the most part i saw pike's-- wait her celestial being wasn't still there looks okay looks like home i couldn't tell burned i told you to get a fire box where's kash kash was really mad at us last time we talked to him i talked to him last time you guys are forcing me into going and talking to kash aren't you scanlan we got armor out of it though it's not like we didn't get something from it i go find kash you had one job pit crew buy her a drink first i try not to step on any cracks in the sidewalk on the way it's very important he's on the outside oh shit i drop to one knee and start tying my boot i start retying my shoe oh my god kash whoa i didn't see you there sorry i've had something in my eye ever since this scrying spell earlier shit's been blurry yeah no you're clearly in focus now hi hey how's it going man okay kash i'm sensing a little bit of underlying aggression okay look i know we fucked you look (stammers) i'm trying to think of what to say please help us we're going to die and we need you i'm sorry okay you know how we've been hunting down those dragons we've been doing an okay job because we've killed a few but now there's the big one that's left thordak and then we might be working with the one that killed all my people if you remember that there was one that killed them so now we're working with her and we're gathering an entire army and we need as many talented and charming and gifted people that we can get so i thought-- i'm really sorry we made you be an errand boy i didn't vote for that by the way i was trying to-- why did you bring back vex maybe vax will kill you if you don't help us that's not true you did it because you're a good person you ultimately want to see change in the world i know you do and i know you care even though you pretend like you don't so that's why kash that's not the type of change-- there are better ways to bring change than through death and destruction everyone and then zahra wow should have led with that all right let's go this way glad i spilled my soul and everything and i just splashed coffee in my face come on kash come on that's right you're the prince of whitestone can't you tap some taxes or something that's massive don't mix your darks with your clears-- pick one plug it's the sword no but he has resistance to physical damage and if he takes a potion of fire resistance is he pretty much covered the same way if he's raging and has a fire potion yeah we've been using them we tried we put them all in a pile (laughter) yeah there are other vestiges too that are out there if we have plenty of potions i'll take it so i don't have to use a concentration spell there's also the discussion-- are we going to try and lure thordak out of his lair as a challenger yes but we can also try and formulate at least a vague plan so that we all don't die within a single-- all right okay let's build off of what kash has hang on hang on he's right we have two dragons a whole other dragon i told you we were going to die if we didn't have you right yeah it just seems so highly defeatist to already plan for-- you know defeat okay then we need to talk about the forces that are going in more armies are talented than others then we need to get this plan to him so we're going to have waves of assault from one position have other people flank in from another position-- i think we need to meet with the general like tonight right now yeah i feel like you can't really scribble an elaborate battle plan in a 25-word message but the message spell that allura is using only allows for very minimal conversation it's not exactly-- she can't have a full-blown conversation with them yeah a hundred percent well it blows a spell what time is it do we know exactly where the syngorn army is how far away from-- kima she's in the fray wow that's awesome we were curious if you knew the location of the syngorn army do you know the status of the other armies their air force is also giant wyvern beasts do we know how many spellcasters are in the syngorn army we need to figure out how many spellcasters they can throw down long-range large covering spells all right hang on how about this we know that they're to arrive in emon by the afternoon we can just try to connect with them in the early morning and march in with them then split when we get closer to the gates rad i'm still concerned we don't have enough air support for the 500 wyverns yes well i'm thinking-- i wasn't wanting to necessarily tap into this resource unless necessary but i think it's necessary i can contact the air ashari and have them specifically on air support i can contact my father at the air ashari can you message korren oh shit uh-huh yeah right yes because we're not leaving until the morning now sure yeah oh man (gasps) who wants to go see my hometown you guys okay you know what i wasn't looking at you scanlan okay i can show you where i went to school is allura coming with us too i thought she was she doesn't have to okay come on allura let's go it's great we have these really great crepes that we make it's like our hometown special okay okay i mean we're air ashari we don't have to live in a hellscape our whole lives come on we control it it's great (sighs) doesn't it smell good it smells so fresh up here you know you don't have to deal with the pollution down there oh look over there that's where i learned to shapeshift into a squirrel for the first time-- yeah no then let's start walking okay yeah and over there was the first time that my dad taught me how to fly he just pushed me off the cliff-- it's a quiet mountain town everything closes at like five it was actually annoying growing up i told you it was remote 14 total do i know what that is is that normal oh that's a person (laughter) oh it is normal for me oh like a-- yeah dad what's wrong i mean i guess you could say it was going to be passing in that we don't have a lot of time we're here to ask for help for the air ashari's aid why do i sense trepidation in your voice you sent me on this path to prove myself worthy and a hero i'm following what i thought you wanted of me i will continue my duties as i promised from the beginning as those supersede being your daughter and i am here for unfortunate reasons and i wish i wasn't we need the best we need as many of the top soldiers that we have i'm looking at you at my people for air support there's about five maybe six hundred maybe even more wyverns covering the city so far we don't have a lot of options i was hoping maybe some of the best nature manipulators could create a hazardous storm ahead of time see what we can do to take out as much in bulk i know i got educated tomorrow afternoon oh shit we have flares (laughter) we're spitballing this as we go dad so we can work on a sign together right i can do that okay the syngorn army with all due respect if you have seen through their illusion does that mean-- i'm sure many of thordak's spies could do the same yeah me too are you going to come as well okay this is vax by the way yeah you have he came with me so-- yeah see you tomorrow i guess yes i just give him a big hug in response i miss you dad you have my word i won't let you down are these the new models they've really upgraded them have i been gone that long well they look great okay all right okay bye yeah we should yeah that's right sorry i should have introduced you i guess sorry i got distracted by talking to you as my father and not as allura that was my dad let's go when we come back i'll have to show you the first time i-- ooh (laughs) it's a power play i love it and by asap we mean as soon as we get out the other 20 packages we need to get out and then you're in the queue welcome to being in line i didn't want this i just got out of the shop just got out every j-rpg and i'm going to go ahead and attune to my cape instead of my ring yeah i go up to vex and go why-- why is this happening is this happening for like a-- did they tell you-- did they tell you the reason i can tell-- i've been with you for a long time i can tell when you're lying to me now you're patronizing me i didn't know how badly i wanted this until now you're about to fight a fucking dragon you're fighting kash i need to roll really fast to recharge my spire so i'm going to do that real fast it goes all the way up it is full again i rolled four plus four wow yeah that's what i was thinking about i will be able to find out when we scry if not we'll have to talk to allura i'm going to scry real quick scrying eye can't hide from my scrying eyes your dad what's his name syldor okay happy and healthy and comfortable by a fire no he's not with the army is what i mean oh shit i thought he was going to be with the army okay i'll scry again allura do you know where they are can i help her a little bit the problem is it generally has to be a tree that i'm familiar with it doesn't work that way can i that's an excellent question can i like if i go with allura and then open a gate through the sun tree and they're just ready to rock oh damn it fucking lost my sling ring hey i'll do that does anyone else want to go just in case where's raishan though vax please don't-- all right i called in assistance from the air ashari from the north they're maintaining the skies did dad tell me how many oh shit thanks dad roughly a hundred that's right when you were looking for kaylie and we know thordak has made an underground basin he only emerges when someone challenges him or offers their loyalty and we can't trust anyone within the city limits the ashari are already looking for a symbol i plan to be aiding them they should be helping us with-- well there will be a storm see told you well i've got my whole skywrite thing i've got my whole skywrite thing i can make a symbol in the air out of clouds which isn't as terrifying as everyone has thought it is in the past we just need to pick a symbol-- it's a-coming man it's coming look for-- keep your eye on the sky there will be a symbol it will be super obvious when it's determined you'll be like oh of course it couldn't have been anything else when you see it don't know what the fuck it's going to be it could be a big vm for vox machina i mean like you know-- we could be like now fucking attack oh natural 20 really eh natural 20 bros fuck you (coughing) sorry i so inhaled my spit keep going (coughing) i'm still dying for a second go on guys is your poop still around try it on the day i'm all right i still have a couple if i could have a fire potion i load up grog's camelback with healing potions we're going out like we came in liam  we're in a little tunnel passing things up and down in a little single file kash pass the trail mix pass it all the way back do we what time is it what time of day is it how long has it been is it almost up when did we eat the feast last night about this time are we about to expire or can we push it was it a midnight snack are we making an above-ground jump to the underground tunnels again how far is the tunnel jump how long do we have to be above ground i'm asking because i might be able to make some holes in the wall to cut us into other tunnels and not have to go above ground at all 20 minutes that was to the entrance to the clasp not the entrance to the sewer system right yeah it's very appropriate yeah what's up 2014 shut up you also rolled a one you both rolled fucking ones move fast he also kind of hates us i think i immediately stop and start looking behind me does this look like we just ran into a trap okay 21 total okay i stand back before i run in with the rest of them i don't want to get us all in a corridor because we're assholes yeah is there a grate ahead of us can i see the sky i can conjure an elemental will it-- what kind of wall is it can i use stoneshape to stoneshape us a hole through it the problem is i don't know how far the tunnel has collapsed i took-- okay here's the thing i took move earth i can try and tunnel us through but that's a pretty big spell do fire giants have any reason to attack lizard people we need you guys we need-- we need you i grab kash by the arm really fast and i just say thank you and i give him a kiss on the cheek just shut up and appreciate it go 18 i immediately right above us create a little eye-of-the-hurricane and you know when it snows and there's a moonbow a rainbow i do a little bit of a moonbow situation and then we run can we all take a nervous swig of our fire resistance potions like right now like glug glug glug you told me they were dead thanks for sacrificing yourself hopefully you're not dead you don't know the show
