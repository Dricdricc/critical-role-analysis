we're like the only show that a sponsor's going to let us get away with botching their product i don't like millennials i'm a centennial if you watched talks machina this week on tuesday night you saw that we gave away a promo code hashtag-- no no hashtags it's just a code just the code talks like if you're talking like i'm doing right now talks as in talks machina and that gives you 30 days free trial on alpha so if you're a good gamer like sam is-- you know that those things stack so you can use your free subscription from amazon prime and then use another 30 days and then it's only 30 more days before your checks expire and then they're not good anymore anyway yes promo code talks oh you should also go watch talks machina too it's good fun so we have critical role socks which apparently they've done really good we've already sold half and people are already super excited for us to have character-driven socks we came up with socks machina at the same time that we came up with lox machina which is our branded smoked salmon oh with little fur on top do we have pass without a trace we've done it before and we can do it again ten total it just means you won't die first can we all move up a little bit pike can you sense her like she's got something masking her that whole thing right okay keyleth steps forward a little bit towards the twins keyleth just says did you find what you were looking for and this is the answer to your disease you were looking for your curse i'm assuming it has something to do with the soul gem do you think you can resist the same type of madman mentality that thordak fell victim to when you anchor yourself magic grog the magic mike sequel i did write it down at one point in time but i'm not going to look for it right now the badger that's even better keyleth steps forward again a little bit more and says-- excuse me sorry i just want to i just okay i want to keep walking up to her as much as i can yes while all this is happening keyleth is speaking to try and keep her attention you know raishan you've taught me a lot about myself these past few weeks arguably more than i've learned about myself my entire years of living inspiration's a word i guess you could use i would say more of a cautionary tale in an odd way i hope i never become you all those years of long life that some many call a blessing i'm sure there are many lonely moments and i hope in my darkest of times i don't turn to rage and anger and selfish actions the way you did that may be true i see i have your attention after all no we i mean we know (all laugh) touche you're correct we reneged on our deal just as you did on your end there was a mutual distrust we knew that from the beginning it does but in terms of negotiation you presented your deal so we will now present ours my want for revenge against you while still strong and very palpable i now understand was ultimately selfish only in the sense that everyone else in tal'dorei should share in the revelry of bringing you to justice i am not the only one-- we are not the only ones-- who have felt the ramifications of your destructive actions and as much as i would like to make do on my promise that i told you weeks ago and end your life right now i desperately want the rest of tal'dorei to feel that satisfaction as well so you surrender now you come with us under means of temporary control we take you back to emon-- maybe the fire ashari we'll work that out we're going to take you and you face trial amongst the tal'dorei council the people of the ashari and on behalf of the rest of the citizens of exandria if you choose to not take this offer then i guess we will see whose final resting place it will be in this cave i mirror her puff up a little bit that might be true but at least that is the fate of our own consequences and our own doing not some outwardly force forcing their repercussions on us and you should know raishan i've stepped on plenty of anthills in my day those that don't die revolt and guess what there are some pretty nasty stings from some ants out there the strength of a colony is stronger than the individual of one great diseased foot nope i guess we can say the same for yours i guess it's a matter of who wins now i'm giving you one last shot surrender and if you choose not to at least we can go forward in our consciences and know that we gave you a choice is she a hologram is she an illusion wait that's the dead body of thordak right she's not possessing thordak is she she's speaking through him-- oh undead that's right lucky green lucky green come on ah if it wasn't so ironic (singing) on your wedding day thank god you guys are alive thank fuck four i think that's you because you're a fancy fighter i was talking i was

there an island i tell them what happened when i wake up i don't even know where they could be they're in the middle of the ocean they could be right off the coast or hundreds of miles from here this ocean but they're our friends are we just going to leave them behind i mean keyleth starts hyperventilating panicking a little bit they're okay right allura will figure it out right okay this is taking everything to not stay here okay i do a useless scan of the ocean out of desperation to see if i see anything natural 20 it's true it was a gil dice it was gil's dice you can see you can see 31 perception's 11 there they are oh shit-- i don't know if that's them i think that's them no i know i know but look look there's something it could be something else but it's something i'm trying to give vex over the earpiece like a warmer warmer warmer colder a little-- ten degrees to your left i just keep saying vex did you find them vex i'm just crying in kerrek's shoulder right now just bawling my eyes out i swear i saw them i swear still sobbing into kerrek's shoulder oh god so wait maybe they were just dead and i saw their ghosts what and i just cry harder let's take a tree shall we i hold the door open like it's a closing elevator am i sure it's fucking whitestone go and i go in last i cry to kerr a little bit more okay sorry no should we get him to the castle or the raven queen's temple okay to the temple to the temple okay i use my-- oh jeez i can't remember-- no i didn't use any of my scrying eye on raishan at all right that was my spell just now i will use my scrying eye now to see if i can find kaylie that's cocked that's not bad just a regular-- what do i use con saving throw then 16 oh my god oh my god no 16 she's in kymal oh i love her so much right now knowing how scrying works and knowing that certain magic-casters can feel it-- this is going on a limb i just yell through the scrying and audibly amongst everyone kaylie it's scanlan trying to push through the magical boundary and see if i can at least get a reaction out of her and i scream again kaylie god damn it i wish you could talk to people through scrying sometimes she's in kymal allura might be able to send her a message allura do you still have any messages left has she ever met kaylie i'm tapped out of teleportations tapped out of teleportation in a tavern in kymal yeah i grab grog on the outside of the temple also standing outside and i just grab him by his massive gigantic shoulder and say you were closer to him than probably anyone else in this group you knew more of his secrets than anyone else i think it would mean something if you talked to him from beyond his spirit still holds on you can still speak to his spirit and convince it to come back convince it to come back grog you knew him you knew him look inside and you will know and i crack the door to the temple open and try and gesture him in you don't have to be religious you had the connection with scanlan and you have heart that connection speaks far stronger than any religion ever could it's up to you we don't know if kaylie will make it well i was talking to grog what about-- oh jeez i don't know his name i mean reno's already pretty seedy so sorry reno yeah he is he's going to be so pissed i so approve of this by the way this is the way to do this okay byeeee sorry (singing) my father wasn't around gah it's going to be another percy situation scanlan's going to be dead for a week schrodinger's scanlan sam won't be here oh yeah maybe he can skype in (whoops) like legit we were all talking we thought you were going to die we thought you were going to be our agent coulson yeah shoot for the moon sometimes you'll land at the how do you want to do this i had a few lucky rolls yeah i was waiting for this keyleth will always be an awkward mess as much character growth as you can have you're still always you she will always be awkward i will always trip and fall and faceplant in lava
