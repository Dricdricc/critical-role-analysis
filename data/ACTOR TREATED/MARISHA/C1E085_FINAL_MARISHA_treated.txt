considered paid up in a way i don't know sure okay what are you asking of me right now later do you wanna go now while we're here you're sure so just getting this straight what you're proposing is a raven queen-slash-velvet date night visit back to vasselheim like you go to church and then we go to the casino sure mm-hm okay i mean the fact that any of us are still doing that is impressive at this point okay so that will be-- that's a good date night to look forward to let's go home i guess way down the line sure are you sure you don't wanna just hop in the raven's spa tonight uh-huh yeah are you okay you're a little-- you look a little sweaty yeah you've got the julia roberts vein going (laughs) don't worry about it you're right you're right all right let's go let's go everything's fine here too by the way no we're never awkward huh i could do a tree huh yes yes if wizardry is bob fosse druidism is twyla tharp i might know my modern choreographers okay let's go back to whitestone it does not make that sound that's what you're trying to do it does not sound like that that is not canon they don't trees don't fart they poot okay the cantrip gust is one called the house of bosoms it's like the house of cards of porno ihob keyleth takes a little bit of the gunk off and what is it look how do you think druids discover things okay someone has to figure out what's poison and what's not this is funny this is funny was this you this is funny you clearly have some very intense dreams scanlan definitely not true scanlan do you think any of us could have gotten here without each other i thought you knew that more than the rest of us maybe we just thought you didn't need us as much as you felt like we didn't i did too scanlan do you wish we wouldn't have brought you back should we not have done that scanlan-- yeah you're a better father than most of us have ever had i'm sorry if we had selfish intentions yeah grog knows what i'm trying to say scanlan as much as you can say that you were just the funny guy who played music and made jokes i don't think you realize how desperately we need that that's nothing to scoff at that's not a talent that many of us naturally possess you've taught me so much about the brightness of the world and to look at the light side of things that's not true you do care (timidly) hey-- hey guys we're friends right are we friends that's fair where're you going to go what're you going to do no no it didn't he doesn't hate us i just think we've all just discovered that maybe we have a lot more secrets about ourselves than we've all ever let on i dunno i think percy's right we're worse than friends we're family and family leaves can we not be family can we like redact that so what just-- the half-elves are left alone in a room covered in pudding crying angry do you think that if we would've not covered the room in pudding that he would have stayed and you had to stay in a shitty bnb a brothel and-- (laughs) oh right pike right yeah we could always go back to vasselheim and pick up on that little drinking yeah i mean we can drink anywhere vasselheim doesn't have to be in that equation i have to go to the water ashari i have to pike you know the ozmit sea you've sailed it yeah we might need you for the water ashari seems like-- i guess all of us are picking up on our own individual paths from here i guess is scanlan right have we become too close to each other do we need to all take our individual time like we've done in the past 'course what are you getting at vax and then i look at vax and percy and say-- oh sorry vax and-- --pike and say and my takeaway is that maybe we were forgetting who we were before we all banded together and then i leave the room it's the basement in westworld we all just go catatonic i chase down vex and we do the same thing no we know i see vax the next morning and i say look your sister gave me one of her blue feathers it's because this is the darkest timeline it's because this is the darkest timeline and i stole it from you what did you do last night worked you were productive you made the rest of us look and feel like shit what did you make did
