where did that camera come from let me see over here is that you did you do that that's actually pretty good man that's pretty good i have some fierce bone structure going i love that you broke rule number one of pictionary and labeled things when did you do these last night are you serious we left at midnight why the pink lipstick man have you ever seen ashley wear pink lipstick although i appreciate her guns and her biceps not an april fools' joke we went international pro-ject alpha pro-ject that alpha featuring satine which we timed out pretty well i think intentionally i'm not sure totally intentionally so if you don't know who satine is get introduced to her with this week's episode of signal boost and then she'll lead you graciously into gm tips she's awesome i have kind of a girl crush on satine she's so cool yeah you should go watch her and apparently he smells like cabbage (sings) 9th-level spells yeah (all laugh) you okay did you have a nightmare i have them too do you want to talk about it okay do you need anything i do a little bit of druidcraft something like lightning bugs in the room and make them dance nice and calming just trying to get back to sleep as i wake up before we head downstairs i grab vax did you get back to sleep are you all right never always yeah no sure let's go thanks yeah same communal style half-elves are just (gnawing noises) dwarf right wrong note shayne tranter see as i wrote down i believe shayne cordell jarett kendrick and nitebe get 100 a month yeah and because he was hot that's right so reducing our costs we're getting better at this we should have some sort of service then or at least a dinner in cordell's honor vox machina not returning your calls since 1992 i can try and scry want me to scry on nitebe i can all right i scry on nitebe actually good question yeah it's only in black and white yeah i'm afraid the insane things that grog just said is correct yes travis whatever timeline you believe in there's got to be public record right i feel like the city is pretty overwhelmed at the moment though how do you feel about your workload do you feel like you can handle this well we talked about going to the cobalt reserve to drop off this-- and then-- i mean there's that yeah it's weird i don't know well not like a fireplace mantle although i could technically transform into a fireplace now because i'm a badass you know i could i'm pretty sure no i could hang on hang on a mimic couldn't i turn into a mimic that could be a door or a mantle can i be a door we'll think about it anyway it's fine yeah we're very open-minded does he have an aversion to wearing pants all blinged out (stammers) well it's just weird it's just weird it's been so long it's a lot of build-up and then it's going to be over i'm serious he could yeah it's just my whole life has been building up to this and if we complete it that makes it real if i complete it then i am the voice of the tempest i imagine i can do whatever i want right i don't know i'm not entirely sure of the difference of what you just said i guess it is that notion of leading up to this one moment that you've thought of for a while once you complete that what happens next is it though yeah yeah sure it's whatever you guys think is best we can go to westruun first or we can go to zephra first just whatever you want no it's the difference of a day or two right do we need an extra day to convince grog to wear pants that could be the deciding factor maybe we should put it on him right what (groans) (laughs) let's check in at westruun drop off the book we'll head from westruun to zephra all right man decision-making is hard so many choices good question who's importing more where's fashion week happening if it's the pittsburgh then we should go now because everything closes at five we did mention if we wanted to drop off the book at westruun or vasselheim-- do we want to do that instead all right let's go to vasselheim how far north have you been tary you're from wildmount correct it is quite chilly let's go anything else we need to do before we leave emon tary vasselheim does get a little bit-- arcane magic can you do that i don't think so he's upset about the notion of pants this is going to look ridiculous everyone's going to be like that's a robot wearing a mask just bluff your way through it this is the best thing we've ever wasted time on where are those pottery tools gil (laughs) it's a good roll cher was great in that oh my gosh secretgoatee (all laugh) this is the worst thing sure yeah i was just going to say been through a fire yeah let's go mainly these three-- druidcraft oh i think this is your hair-dying robe now sorry and now your-- does that mean that the-- you're right now that i've blurred my vision the glue is the most noticeable part hey where did you learn contouring (laughs) because that's really well done good point let's go it's the elvish half vasselheim and we have the book we have the book in the chest chest and the book all right where wasn't there the tree that was near the slayer's take yeah we'll do that yeah what do they call it never mind there yes thank you because i imagine they'd have a good hiding place yeah yeah yeah correct and then shops for more potions that's actually not a bad plan okay you're going to go research orcus the twins all right percy you want to go to the platinum reserve all right we'll take the book tary you want to come with us or the twins all right grog books oh do you want to be team potions team shopping right grog to the library which is to the place where they-- (shouts) to the archive they're right next door they're connected they're partners so we have the book they went to the sanctuary we are going to the library okay you guys i thought our whole thing was that we were taking the book to the sanctuary and then you guys were like we're going to the sanctuary because you guys totally gave me shit when i was like the library and you were like not the library but apparently we are all right let's go to the library we said we had the book i thought we took the book that was our whole fucking plan-- -- that we took the damn book but i would assume if we said we're taking the book that would mean-- we have the book i thought we put it in a box right we wrapped it in cloth okay i'm sorry-- i am keyleth of the air ashari and this is percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii we're a part of the group vox machina we've been through here before we're part of the slayer's take this is a matter of great importance so if there is any type of upper management we could talk to-- (all laugh) (coughs) mm 11 and yet worst case scenario i also have this book that scanlan read that's on how to be a good leader-- all right i'll hold on to it it's a rakshasa anyone look familiar any uniforms that look recognizable it's on another dice all right oh that's good that's a 19 perception 21 sorry 20 yeah 21 no 31 31 right theft protection any reason for the sudden spark in interest good on them can you do that with your toes yes which one are you opening which one are you opening percy the orcus one weird question abyssal i know creatures who are from the abyss right i've encountered them if i do a shapechange into a demon can i then read abyssal i would let him know i would give him like a disclaimer you keep the same mental stats but you get the abilities-- in addition i don't know what was that demon guy we encountered does he have a name the pit fiend was a devil who was the guy who lied to us and you said devil at one point and he was actually a demon succubus are-- yeah and they're demons right no okay you know what you're reading the book on the nine hells that'll tell us what fiends there are right read the book yes (laughs) does it mention any abyssal fiends that they particularly hate that we might have encountered (sings yakety sax) so were we supposed to take the book or were they supposed to take the book well i also thought we were going to the reserve and now we're in the library i'm so confused on our plan so it's the realm of dis and the leader is-- taliesin and and the first layer of hell is also referred to as the layer of inyimenemo-- what avernus atlas obscura that shit any information on how to get there laura and i can plane shift there i do a very detailed look at what the iron city of dis seems like-- are you serious oh my god come on grog wow wyrmwood with a 'y' we're going to finish up and try and get out i guess we want to talk to kusuo and see okay thank you and would it be possible if we bring friends of ours in the future who are-- yeah who are fluent in these languages thank you we totally do i know-- i thought-- you know i think-- i don't know well some good stuff we found one book that we could read and one book that we couldn't so we'll have to come back with you guys because it was all written in abyssal yes because your father forced you to do things we built dis city on rock'n'roll pittsburgh yeah yeah (laughs nervously) what did you guys find out is it a good spot a good home for it do you want to drop it off it's like our magical items it's not easy to destroy them seems like a pretty powerful book but it might not be a bad-- i mean we did drop off the horn of orcus here what where there where you're going to go back to the temple i'll get things packed i look at vex oh goddamnit pittsburgh get it girl get it get it girl i toss them 20 gold an extra 20 minutes please thank you what mm you know it's a little esoteric for me a little experimental a little gaga-esque you know it reminds a little of when we dressed trinket up in pink bows i don't know if that's a good thing make us pretty i'm going to become royalty kind of but not really yes vex this collar is so big why can't i see over it yeah can we dip-dye it blue yeah yeah yeah okay hey laura and are you broken again ah yes designer couture i know it's like look at the beading it's crazy in the morning i'll look at the beading (all laugh) you're doing really well at perfecting your mystical voice yeah it's good it's good i like it oh black and tan what do you mean by the goods where did you keep that where'd you just pull that from whoa jeez uh-huh right (gasps) that's so smart wow and probably much cheaper than just buying in bars all the time wow hey oh sorry (laughs) what what did you tell doty what did you inform him right before-- potentially murdered the-- doty i might-- oh what you want me to ask doty or you want me to ask tary -- just unconscious are you sure did you check grog okay-- that doesn't-- tary what do you mean you didn't tell him to-- he just did this on -- (sighs) tary is this thing safe to be following us around no way we'd buy that delivery can i roll an insight check that's bullshit there's no fucking way what oh bullshit that was the most bullshit delivery mm mm 21 (quietly) grog do we need to make sure you're with an adult from here on out can you not be trusted alone with tary no no do not do not be influenced by his very generous act of kindness that was so kind of you that was like 6000 gold worth of-- but do not don't are you sure they're dead grog-- tary it sounds like all of the opposite of that is true except for the mistakes part yeah vax oh you did not go to that guy the guy who-- oh no insight check now you're the fucking boy who cried wolf three times god damn it don't fuck me gil oh jeez that wasn't great 15 that looks like tary's vomit because i saw him puke under the water and it floated right past me i got a great view of it he's a nervous puker but it seems like it might be okay right did you get it yeah real-life hero yeah tary going forward i think you need to recognize how literal doty takes things and maybe think maybe more detailedly on how you word things maybe from innocent guards yes let's learn it from you hm yes yeah i mean we could catch brunch first all right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let's go okay let's go it was just vax and allura-- whom we kind of forgot was with us (nervous laugh) yeah (inhales) oh man no no no we're on the mountain i forgot you guys haven't seen my hometown yet okay all right let's go that way okay see over there is where i caught my first baby griffin-- -- he was lost and got separated from his mom and i captured him up and i tucked him up under my shirt and over there actually-- -- i tripped and fell and that was the first time that i scraped my knee-- -- and i was like oh no i'm bleeding oh it was so terrible yeah yes hi hi what's your name oh my goodness sora wow last time i saw you you were like like oh man look how big you've gotten do you still know that handshake do you remember the-- and there you've got it you got it yeah yeah oh man you forgot-- yeah i guess i am hey hey sora sora have you seen my dad around yeah okay i just drop to a knee and say kaitiyaki father yes we have defeated the chroma conclave the help of vox machina and many many others at the cost of many lives yes thank you the air ashari were very valuable during that day very courageous sorry i thought uvenda might have said something i'm here because i have completed my aramente and have come for my blessing still waiting on your final word i guess yeah didn't think i'd make it here i couldn't have done any of this without not only the support of every person in zephra and every person of the ashari tribe members of emon tal'dorei marquet even wildmount in my journeys i've learned being a leader is a global effort one that takes the wisdom of many most importantly i couldn't have done any of this without vox machina and the pieces of them that i've taken away and have desperately tried to emulate in each one of them over the years each one of them with qualities that i admire and strive to embrace grog with his strength and his unyielding loyalty vex with her self-confidence and utter fearlessness vax is one of the most compassionate people i think i've ever come across and one of the most brave even if it's maybe foolish percival with your intelligence and your sensibility is always there to be my balance scanlan with his charisma and his wit pike-- pike her generosity and her authenticity always true to herself and even tary taryon darrington whose blind faith in vox machina and perseverance trusted us even though he probably shouldn't have all of these things that i learned and couldn't be a leader without vox machina makes up me zephra makes up me the ashari people and all of greater exandria i don't know if i'm the leader that you deserve or a good leader but i'm willing to dedicate the rest of my life to doing whatever i can for all of us as long as vox machina stands by my side what i get the what now oh what well you guys are out of luck with the charisma modifier shit but what (all laugh) that is fucking dope jeez no yes (all laugh) no shit and send out the next one
