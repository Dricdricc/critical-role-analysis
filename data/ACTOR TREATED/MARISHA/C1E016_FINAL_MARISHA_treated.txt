awesome times good times good time together we're doing a panel aren't we yeah it is at petco park so don't get lost looking around the convention center because it won't be there it's at petco park we're working it out how's new jersey on river time what did you instantly turn into a 64-year-old golfer as soon as you went there well i think the intro-- makes it too real what's going on and we can see you more yeah (laughs) travis takes up this side of the frame (crow sound) (laughter) yeah ah ha oh right brady bunch style hi travis everyone looks right so if we're looking this way hi matt yeah we're still kind of confused go ahead and bring him on you can come say hi oh we probably could have been going for a while we've just been like dicking around sam's here hi sam (laughs) you don't listen anyway well we just-- so we fought off the wyverns yeah his beard let's go for the beard yep i have some beads if you want we can braid it and put beads in there okay and put beads in it and a few flowers as well it looks nice looks good you'll get used to it can i do a nature check to see if this seems to be natural or arcane okay that's a 10 plus-- 20 total no write it right here i throw up a slate i'm sorry aww oh man (gasps) it's snowing there was something i should probably tell you in this area of land in vasselheim on this continent somewhere i'm not sure where resides the fire ashari somewhere in the town of pyrah well they're my sister tribe they're a part of my sister tribe i come from the air ashari yeah from zephra yeah so there are fire ashari so the point behind the ashari-- i'm not sure i have expressed this to you all in the past few months the point of our tribe is we sought out the weakest points where the elemental planes start to bleed with our plane of existence and these planes need to be protected so our people have sought them all out in order to make haven there and be the protectors that we were all born to be and as part of my aramente i have to seek out each of the headmasters and prove myself a worthy leader which makes me really nervous so i just thought you know maybe after we handle the horn maybe we can pop in you know since we're here oh that could be good oh that sounds fun well they kind of teach me new things they kind of instill me with their knowledge i could i know i'm so excited but yes super nervous because social skills aren't my strongest suit oh you guys yes yes what what well yes yeah no we're all happy i mean that's kind of the thing where once a generation someone sets out and goes on the aramente in order to come back a headmaster and it's kind of like our once-a-generation check-in if you will to make sure everything's okay unfortunately the last person to go on the aramente didn't come back which happens sometimes yeah no it was actually my mother i-- we don't know she left when i was a little girl so i don't remember much so i don't know if she's alive or dead really but-- it's okay it's okay i mean it's-- i mean well it's fine it's just it's weird i haven't seen her so i don't know i barely remember her no no i wouldn't think so yeah we're pretty-- we're cool i'm assuming it would be okay we're pretty welcoming yeah yeah that'd be interesting it's weird there's this part of me in the back of my head that kind of always wonders if i'm going to run into her i was five six maybe years old when she left so i'm the next in line i'm sorry i didn't mean to bring the mood down i'm just letting you know that we're going to be in that neck of the woods so i should probably-- -- you know go why did she say that (laughs) i know that was so weird right a siege no oh that's right we went shopping i remember yep oh it's like a sims thing he's happy keyleth oh so-- so am i correct to assume our plan is that we're going to march this horn through the town until we get to the temple i mean we can only assume-- yonn how many people in this city are aware of this horn being brought here highbearer vor-- his name is vord we've basically walked into the crucible so wait hang on hang on hang on before we move on-- we're about to leave i'm assuming should a few of us kind of like flank around and-- rooftop shit yeah i can go eagle form and have aerial support overwatch what's that yeah okay yeah i'm going eagle chicken through the magic door okay so it's like new york is it sticking out like a sore thumb is it sticking out like a sore thumb damn maybe we should've thrown a blanket or something over it burlap sack or something anybody percy you've been so quiet here lately can i see inside the temple or are the temples pretty enclosed well i was an eagle flying overhead and i was gonna do a perception check to see if i noticed like kinda do a loop of the temple so i'm an eagle right now so 20 total i'm gonna go check that out first (eagle noises) gonna see if i can figure out what's making the trees move i'm flying i'm fine i have advantage because i'm an eagle ooh natural 20 sam and okay a common occurrence okay good to know i'm going to loop back around is there like an open window in the temple that i can just fly through-- be like that windex commercial back in the day i break my neck i die okay i'll do that hi hi i am with vox machina i'm pretty sure they just came through the front door it's cool i was just doing-- just like aerial support i'm just going to go and reconnect with my group it's fine i'm keyleth i'm not good at this shit what am i doing a persuasion check christ shut up oh wait i don't know why i'm rolling two six

did you guys see that i'm starting to feel so hardcore i do need a tattoo oh (gasps) this temple goes to six oh that's right whoa do i see or learn anything about the elemental planes that i didn't know before ah so pretty we just made cave drawings i don't-- yeah kima what's happening okay yeah-huh we could have just told you that oh man thanks yonn he has seniority so wait you said you lost the crystal of exaltation during the war of-- during the war of what beginnings the war of the beginnings and how long ago was this war of the beginnings it was created then called what during what war oh just a siege so just to get one thing clear and i mean no (clears throat) disrespect but how was the crystal lost 300 years ago if it was in this chamber so this chamber has been broken into before oh oh so someone brought it out and then was clumsy and lost it oh so it was destroyed you should change your verbage here yeah we're good (laughs) no he won't a 30 (laughs) we've got to get you deceiving more you should lie more it's good sister (laughter) huh is there a blueprint somewhere (laughs) it's like having your high-beams on when it's foggy i go ahead and i do a little wind gust and i go (blows air) down the hall to clear out the fog gust of wind wait do i still have one my gust of wind-- my gust of wind lasts up to one minute by the way so i can keep-- i'm just airbending not much time wow son of a bitch it's all right also 13 to who the rest of us ouch okay (weak chuckle) let's move wait hang on burning another spell slot all right here we go oh no he doesn't care thanks i tried to get a little of a sage thing a little orange blossom it's nice it's also pure oxygen so we could get a little buzz we made it oh yeah oh it's like a mini-game holy shit oh my god if you get crushed to death-- for a lever or something go sharpshooters go i place my hands on her shoulders-- and i give her enhance ability you have advantage on-- oh ability checks it's just ability checks never mind (whispering) it's so quiet a wrench in the machine (laughs) pretty damn close to impossible so can we take a short rest to heal up and then also a short rest to take a short rest in real life i'm going to do that oh my god i rolled two eights in a row that's awesome they also just went up on our website on critrolecom so you can go to our website and find the link
