it's like santa tracker but taliesin tracker that's awesome yeah should we go off and do a shout-out of each of our charities we do and of course sam is with pablove foundation pablove foundation which is amazing i chose the nature conservancy they're great and they protect the lands and the animals that is very important so we can keep having a beautiful green world yeah that's a good stretch of charities sorry i sometimes forget about you because you're on that side all things that are important for the future and of course as always critical role always supports 826la continually they are our sponsored charity of choice and of course look up 826 there might be an 826 in your area and you should go to their storefronts they make great date locations as taliesin always says find the date first don't try and find dates at 826 that gets-- that's bad (laughter) good show guys so what time is it it was nighttime right or was it midday remember they turned into shooting stars and they flew away yeah i can mass sense alignment no i'm saying i could do some insight checks on people no i'm not pike i'm on it with vex 22 is there any deceased that need to be tended to that's what i was worried about okay yeah we put him to bed already yes how long ago was this she's already been down there she's already been down there you think they're going to recognize her now well hang on hang on what are we going to say to them when we get down there what are we going to offer them wait are you talking about us bowing to the clasp or the clasp bowing to the-- okay sorry there were levels you're essentially relying on the underbelly of emon to restore it in your experience i really feel like it might be necessary for me to also reach out to the air and earth and possibly even the water ashari it might be difficult because i haven't been there yet to see if they've had any other tears through the other elemental planes we can also seek to employ their services have you what are your thoughts i can scry twice today i can do it two times so we need to pick where it's most important to check in versus where we might want to pop in and say hello we would have to go to vasselheim and maybe-- like oh like she-- little ceramic dragons she likes collecting them they're also rooted in vasselheim which is-- all right well how about this we can scry between pike and i four times so we can make four phone calls today yes look home no we can peek through a window and we can try and go visit the clasp and i want to check in with-- we don't need to scry into emon you know what let's go talk to pike because pike might possibly have some sort of spiritual connection with vasselheim as well that might save us a scry okay i can also teleport us once today if we decide to go anywhere pike pike do you have any sort of spiritual connection with vasselheim do you feel-- you know how-- okay can you check-- can you see if they're okay we want to scry and check in with a few places okay of course i step up to the table and begin my scrying ritual checking on syngorn first syngorn is gone and i don't mean destroyed i don't mean burnt i don't mean that it's rubble i mean it's gone the city is gone there's like a huge chasm a huge empty spot in the middle of the forest where syngorn once lied lie like that like transported like the city was lifted out of its place and was teleported elsewhere how can you be sure i need to check in on the air ashari i'm going to spend my last scrying right they're okay all right they're okay they seem unaware which is very disheartening on a few levels exactly six seconds well moving quickly from city to city-- i don't know well i mean i've recently discovered that that misty wind walk spell that i cast on all of us is not great for battle but is great for travel and that lasts for eight hours remember how i failed and almost killed us all yeah thanks grog what i learned out of that was it's not great for battle but it is great for travel it lasts for eight hours we can move 300 feet per second i'm with vex you all honestly-- i can transport some of us via plants today i will have to sleep if we want and study to do the misty step again shove a bunch in let whitestone know what's going on because they're going to freak out if like-- they will freak out if 20 refugees pour out of the sun tree and they have no context okay so wait are you going to go on your mission while we go talk to the clasp and no dragons dm question how many do you think i can fit through in six seconds if i put them in like a line and we're like go go go well what we should do-- here's the thing that i'm worried about we don't want like a kid to go through and then they get separated from their mom let's do completed full families who are comfortable relocating how many people yeah a couple single people to bring up the rear all right so let's go to the tree percy you're going to lead percy you're going to lead we're going to put the eight up front with the ten 15 stragglers behind i tell them all all right as soon as you see that tree start to part run run your face off i tell that to the crowd don't stop in the tree you will create terrible congestion thank you scanlan i love it it's so like me maybe with my inspiration i can get a few more seconds in there oh boy oh that's not good can i add my inspiration to this ooh that's good that helps a lot what am i adding just my straight wisdom my modifier 19 total go go now run go go percy go it's like a football line i'm trying to hold it i've got the gatestone i think our reservation's ready hopefully i hooked them up there just choking on percy's idea what-- a magic-- a magic missile an antimagic missile percy when i tried to touch that thing it was like it was sucking me in i don't think that thing and me touched how are we going to turn it into a projectile at the cost of possibly your life have they found anything out did you get any updates what time is it okay did you learn something new grog you seem to have reservations-- (coughing) i'm good mm-hmm sorry i got a piece of chip stuck 35 oh waiting for them to pass okay jesus christ i can do that today just rolled shitty on my initiative i love that the rider is like (derpy noise) go home rider you're drunk five oh boy was that in the box okay how far away am i from this guy like-- roughly how many feet the guy who's in the air flying beautiful i want to move up and around-- here-ish sorry i've got this thing in the way back a little bit-- scoot back is that still in your path he's your-- oh well i'm not going to fuck with him i'm going to-- you dominated the guy should i turn the wyvern into something else should i polymorph him yeah i guess he's dom-- you are dominating that guy is there anything else that's flying he's the only one that's up in the air left right so you commanded him to attack the one below you right i'm going to turn that wyvern into a-- chicken yes poof he has to make a wisdom save fail (laughs) this is my favourite game you guys fuck they all took damage-- and they're on the ground now i didn't fuck it up this time cool that's my turn 39 (laughs) save game plus is it no you're still up you're still up i thought you said you had 55 it was 52 total okay i'm going to push my way through the crowd a little bit can i have that laser pointer thank you okay (grandiose voice) and now with all of the rage thinking about all-- i-- boof boof boof i want some feather-down pillows for our loft i channel all of my fire ashari ancestors and i cast my 7th-level firestorm so as i concentrate enraged at the sight of dragons i have ten-- yes you're fine you're fine no he didn't get you away because he knew this was happening it just happened to work out so ten ten-foot cubes-- they all have to be connected exactly i'm going to start here and i'll work my way over they're ten-foot-- remember they're ten-foot but they're attached so they're bigger than that okay okay oh okay yeah get the wyvern they have to make a dex saving throw or they take-- oh my spell dc 19 i just got it i just got it when i leveled so a giant fiery chasm splits open 24 24 that was four-- 24 that's good so 27 36 30-- 42 points of fire damage (clapping) my hands light up so they explode popcorn and then i take a bow (laughter) i go down to the wyverns and i start going for those stingers there's some ash i go ahead and i do a cantrip gust and start spreading out the ash yeah okay let's do different ones okay so first one i'll definitely take advantage so since i have advantage-- not that much better-- 14 the first one second one 15 total okay i'll give it to-- i'll give that to vax do you have poison or do you-- vax or vex-- i give it to one of the twins here twins you fight over it fight over it two more maybe i can-- 14-- okay well the second one i rolled a 25 that i give to vex last one-- i'll take that 15 with-- 26 he's very claustrophobic well hang on let's heal up i need to hit dice it up as well hi vax did you live in this did you deal with this oh oh that's good follow the water towards the light right towards the light are we going towards the light or towards the rushing water all who vote light say aye taliesin laura and all who vote water say aye to the light (murmurs) he's a spireling ooh can you give us a moment (softly) please (whispering) can we talk about this for a second guys do we really need them are they really providing us with enough to make this worth our while to where we essentially want to open up the pandora's box of crime in vasselheim do we want to be responsible for that i feel like we just took one pretty top-heavy deal and traded it for an even more top-heavy deal not in our favor i'm down for joining them and letting them join our cause and using their infrastructure but beyond that-- he's reading our lips yes i agree-- it's joined forces at this point that's all we can offer them a place to fight at our side we don't even know anyone in a zealot city you want to go to a cleric and be like hey thought you might want to meet the underground mob boss and you got to keep that man's money you seem used to selling your soul percy you just don't know that yet percy you make me so nervous vax we are not abandoning it we already discussed it there's more than one way to cut through this knot i agree percy i'm sorry but i think our methods of being rulers might differ i don't think i need to sell myself for the greater good let's go come on unfortunately no i end with hopefully you will realize there is a far greater enemy at hand than the personal squabbles between us small people and i also step away i'm sure he can hear me no percy the difference is i don't think i'm better than them (fire noise) that thing vex do you have an arrow i hand it to him put this in between your teeth (sizzling noise) i got what you were saying grog but percy do you honestly think that after all of this was done-- do you want to be beholden to those people fuck natural one natural one oh good no i didn't i rolled an eight plus a seven plus ten thank you percy i open the door hi i haven't been wanting to be alone most nights and i let him in i don't know it'll match the rest of the city scanlan what's wrong are you ready vex i can put hallucinatory terrain over it that'll last a bit but not long enough to make it worthwhile (laughing) she's just happier that way we camped out in a few trees outside of vasselheim whatever's closest there wasn't a teleportation circle to vasselheim what's the abundant terrace yeah let's go there that's right outside the city sure well it's in the farming district in the city what was the name of the section of the city that has the slayer's take and also only about a day's travel from pyrah yeah i guess we all settle in it's weird being back you guys yeah do we do that now or do we do that in the morning travis and yeah we traveled who (stammers) so we should probably go to sleep you guys take a nap you know it's jet lag it's teleport lag it gets to you i know it's late yeah we did it's very sad we abandoned emon if you love it you have to-- marisha and
