so awesome lanterns we'll have to check that out members-only jackets we do the hand-eye coordination thing never forget i've been separated from my parents for a really long time you get used to it it's not too bad don't say the word grieve that's strong it's only a few days it'll be good separation makes the heart grow fonder and all that stuff what time is it oh sure let's start early why not don't throw that's rude well since we're getting separated grog is taking the bag of holding right but we had a lot of stuff in that bag of holding i kept most of the stuff that i needed on me but how many healing potions do we have i can go ahead and brush up on healing spells as well make sure i come a little bit more well-equipped just in case i only have one greater healing potion right now okay apparently we have the flying carpet because i think grog was checking out he's breaking up a little bit but i feel like he just told me that we took the flying carpet he's very far away but i feel it's reaching its limits he apparently left us with the flying carpet he said remember you took the flying carpet to break rp for a second yeah i can't you're cutting out you're cutting out grog oh look at that we have it found it we're good oh shit it's the witch's fortune what are you looking for do you know her name remember her name i can probably find it it would take a minute of digging through hang on i've got to go back to my old notes i've got to go back to my old d&d notes keep doing stuff am i with him yes (gasps) trista it's been so long fancy meeting you here you're forsythia you're not taking any questions right now not today it was so nice to see a familiar face in such a strange place she's lovely caustic liquid they're all like no magic and stuff here wait did he say that it was controlled by the clergy hang on just because it is controlled by the clergy doesn't mean that it's legal doesn't mean that if we go knocking on their door requesting potions that they're going to take kindly to that kind of like getting your concealed deadly weapons license in certain places i turn and i lean into tiberius and i say he's going to be cranky the entire time we're on this field trip isn't he i know i guess yes but that's a little forward don't you think and what were they contracted with tiberius we could be on trial i'm sorry i'm sorry were we late we didn't mean to keep you waiting or do you mean like you've been waiting for us for a long time in the destiny we're here and where have you been my whole life kind of way wait is that what people say about me we'll talk later hi what was that no i think is going to be an excellent bonding experience everyone has such a problem with optimism you know public speaking is not really my strong suit okay ordered and paid in advance by anonymous this contract binding in honor and the elements sets upon the agreed members of the slayer's take guildhall and the task of locating and slaying the below-mentioned entity and the recovery of the below-listed harvested anatomy items and any anatomy items not recovered or not in functional condition will be deducted from the final payment and refunded to the client oh this contract is good for three days and should the contract not be fulfilled within that time period all payments are null and void this contract is null and void and membership of the slayer's take is revoked-- outside of the huntmaster's willful forgiveness the quarry has been approved for hunting by the holy paramours of the crown of erathis the quarry of one rakshasa what's a rakshasa tiger man we need two rakshasa eyes one rakshasa tongue one rakshasa heart two rakshasa claws and two rakshasa canine teeth so canine the quarry is where it's been last located oh okay yeah you double-check it i might have missed something that was probably the ballsiest thing you've ever said i thought this was going to be a fun field trip it does it is a tiger person so maybe we can relate just to get this clear a rakshasa's not a beast but it's not a beast by definition northeastern direction do we have any type of plan of attack does anyone know how to fight these things any earthly clue leader boy i take my social cues from other people i'm sorry i agree with that are we supposed to do something with the sand oh that would take so long can we tag-team this the what oh there it is is anyone selling any masks passive or active 21 are there any masks that look like tiger masks is there someone working the stand oh i would like one have you had invaders like this before is there is any indication of the cause of death on these corpses how do they find them does she have any masks that look like a raven a raven mask i want that one oh do you have a little cloak as well a little cape thank you so much as he goes ahead i keep up my pace until i trail behind him a little bit dice shame go rogue go you rolled a one you all have really low self-confidence what's his name what i mean she's a goddess she's not a queen she's a goddess oh wait you mentioned investigators it's not a group of people it's just you're an investigator today kind of thing gotcha is there anyone else that is part of the investigation team that you think would be good to talk to can i do an insight check on him 23 velvet cabaret so we know that this guy-- while we walk there i was talking we know that this guy is a demon from the nine hells so he seems to be targeting wealthy people do you think these are people that tried to get under his control under his servitude and it didn't go his way so he ended up killing them seems to be after power and it seems like it's no secret when he comes to town and according to the guards these murders have been going on for the past few years so it seems like whatever we're dealing with might have time to plan ahead if he's been aware of the past few times that tyrell has come through the town and could possibly know the next time he's coming through how long ago did the bastions say that they raided the velvet cabaret so here's my question do you think he would stick around after it was raided or do you think he'd move on i believe it is three days does this mean that i should go change clothes i was thank you aren't the sconces awesome the leds change colors guys we should have aliases can we have aliases very easy oh you know what maybe i could-- would it be weird if i'm vex that's weird isn't it okay what's a good elven name what's something common in elven you were around this stuff all of my people have weird tribal names what's good oh coralin do i look like a coralin (stutters) what you can be scanlan but i couldn't be vex that's double standard vax i'm just saying she's very nice i feel like i'm

relationship and dealings and we are very interested in all of those interesting businesses mr vince let's not play coy i am sure you have dealt with many a powerful client in your day and i am sure that it is not unfamiliar to you that many powerful clients have many deep secrets we are not bastions and we are not here to accuse and we are not here to investigate your establishment he's shutting down someone do something quick can i do that as well (laughter) we're all going to die 19 about this time i go (fwoosh) and i cast my wind spell and i slam the doors behind us and i slam the shutters
