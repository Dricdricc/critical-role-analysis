that's pretty dope if there is you should call your local post office (laughter) that's awesome you can also build a taliesin robot which i did and named it the taliesin 2000 i don't want to die okay (imitating music) (swishing sound effects) they've got like two or three i'll join you in that that was my next plan i stand behind vex'ahlia don't worry we wouldn't try to poison you the night before a dragon-fight it would we might be able to do one better especially a black dragon's lair this pile of weapons you have here i see a decent amount of javelins a rudimentary harpoon in the hands of some of your strongest could help wrangle him down about that time i light up my hands that is very impressive you're not wrong about that time i walk over to the-- is there a stone wall in here i put my hand against the stone and i cast transmute rock and i push my hand into the stone as it turns to mud i take a spear that's on the floor stick it in and then turn it back see magic (laughter) where is it where is it i think i could lock the whole dragon in beyond that if that fails-- and then i cast for right now i'll just do wall of stone i'm just burning through all my spells as a demonstration and i bring up two pillows two pillows i blast up two pillars right next to kevdak sorry sorry sorry the other big goliath leader and trap him in (whispers) sorry warra sorry so-- i know did not mean to lay a hand fantastic that would be wonderful beyond that in prep i can dig a trench hidden underground around our trap so that whenever we're ready your army can bust out of the ground without being seen pretty much to be fair i actually did it on a trap to kill like eight of your men on the way in and it worked phenomenally so you should trust me it worked well it'll be very spacious it'll be a nice big tunnel it's not going to feel like you're buried alive it'll be awesome it will look like they're coming out of the grave they'll look like badasses not bury them that sounds so dramatic when you say it like that i mean i'm going to make a tunnel there'll be stairs they'll be able to walk freely they'll have air holes it'll be just like when you moved through the sewers to not be seen we would appreciate that actually oh i actually-- i go over to warra real quick before she walks away just to her side and say you look well have the seers told you if it's going to be a boy or a girl yet if you survive this fight i'm pretty sure you'll bear the strongest child anyone has ever known yeah i'm going to start digging a trench how far is it how far away is the nearest tree cluster okay did he just say dragons have really high perception so don't fuck with anything and make it look weird right make it look real good right i don't know her name either we might not have known a name what sam wrote he just wrote down 'reginald's daughter' man i didn't realize 'til now how many people we actually know whose name rhymes with that yeah we know a lot of people weren't you with us percy yeah remember the guy who saved us at the first winter's crest festival yeah he's very nice i'm about to dig a trench so i'll pass heading northeast towards northwest northwest sorry it's noon it's hard to tell in the sky right now northwest oh shit really ah son of a fucking-- looters yellow with black swirls and then a clear potion that-- should've took those from the prison old (laughs) yeah about that yeah figured that much sure so many noises happening yeah do you want fassbender i was actually going to offer him to you 'cause i feel like you might-- i'm pretty sure you don't have to worry about that so you give it a command it takes your full concentration to give it a command and then once you do that it will enact that plan until it's complete or until you tell it otherwise and if you wanted to cast a slow spell just you have to focus and tell it to do that you know i don't know just wing it i kept talking to him like it was a person and i don't think that's necessarily the way to go it's still in scanlan's mansion so he's in wilhand's house with wilhand yeah hopefully wilhand's watching over him right now actually it might've destroyed wilhand's house yeah yes (skype noises) this is the weirdest field (taliesin makes noises on skype) (laughter) yes this seems to happen all the time every time we try to talk to each other i don't think i've really continue continue it's hard to have a conversa-- shut up percy thank you what are you talking about when you left me right-- yeah no that i remember yeah that yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm sorry if i dropped that on you and put any more undue stress that's not what i want-- this is awful yeah no this is pretty bad you know i've actually been wanting to talk to you i wasn't entirely planning on now i know you've been struggling i know you feel like you're drowning and i'm sorry that the raven queen chose you but she did choose you you know as druids i was raised to have an interesting perspective on the gods we are taught that nature is the one true powerful force i have yet to see a god control the sunrise and the sunset so therefore it's hard for me to sometimes have the same faith in these gods personally i believe that just because you're immortal doesn't make you infallible these gods can be great ambassadors of their virtues and what they represent or they can be horrible disgraces to their domains and just because some self-proclaimed person or deity decides that they want control doesn't mean that they have to have control over me now this does not mean that i do not respect the gods and the power that they wield but i mean for the love of sarenrae we have seen pike do many a powerful thing so therefore i do not respect the gods any more than i respect the living people who are standing beside me at this moment so i've also been coming to terms with the fact that it seems that whether we like it or not we are going to have to employ their services looks like we're going to have to be working with them in some way or another myself included if we are going to overcome this so maybe you should start rethinking the way you look at your relationship to the raven queen maybe this can be a fine partnership a fine endeavor to do with her and then once we save the world and we retire and some other young prodigies come forward to save the world again then we can thank her for her services and move on i don't think we'll always need her i don't think you will always need her and keep in mind the one true thing that gives these gods their power are their worshipers so i guess i'll let you choose what you want to be and i walk off to catch up with the ladies vax vex vex you know i was talking to him so-- hey i love you a whole lot i know who i'm talking to who vax oh it'll take me like an hour it's fine what time is it i dig a trench i want it to be far away to where there's a tunnel and then make a circle around it we have to do some stage-setting here we have to set the scene okay can i go ahead and take this time to do-- oh i'm not there yet oh no i'm building a tunnel you're getting fassbender never mind like a treasure chest if-- can you cast it in like a barrel that he's going to break open what exactly does it do the glyph of warding oh so it (explosion) that's cool i'm pretty sure he's immune to most kinds of damage if we lose fassbender-- i can can i do that right now i want to take and cast a stone shape spell and then i want to open and almost make him a chain harness that's embedded into his waist and then while i'm at it can i patch him up all right well how about this vax vex grab a chain okay ready on my go i'm going to shove them in his abdomen okay i'm going to make a spot and just-- ready okay okay do it right now ready i'm going to do another stone shape spell into the ground not bad what's my survival 24 negative i will cast-- i'm going to burn-- i did that earlier but i'm going to burn my last 5th-level spell to do transmute rock again so you said there was dirt all right let's dig a little bit of a hole real quick so we dig a hole ten feet down put the chain in there cover it back up transmute turn it into rock and treasure can i take my last little bit of stone shape residual energy and take that mustache vax drew on-- and make the mustache permanent that he drew on with charcoal i like this i want to keep it there we go you look much better now fassbender high-five yeah isn't that cool it's okay it's cool yeah we should set the stage hey percy we're ready to fly in the trap whenever you are while you guys set the trap i'm going to turn into a raven my job is done here i'm going to just go and circle while they're setting the trap and setting the stage and do patrol and make sure we're not being watched 16 no sorry 15 let's just keep him right off to the side because if that trap triggers-- go ranger go ranger go no we could just tie him to a chair or something make it look-- wrap some rope to make it look like it's loosely tied does that sound fun to you or-- oh my gosh it took a look from pike it depends on where you want to hide i guess (caws) yeah there were two trees that were 80 feet or 60 far away i want it to be more than that i'd like it to be 100 feet away no yeah what i'm thinking is i've got a circle that i've carved around it and then there's like a tunnel that shoots off this way and there's an entrance that they can walk in and get into their places i've made it really thin like i did before carved it nice and thin-- i don't know what that means unless you guys think it would be better it's going to be cool like night of the living dead-style orcs coming out of the ground in my mind it's really awesome so many things it has been used yeah it takes your concentration so it takes-- i'm trying to speak in character all right yeah i'm assuming that was a potion of haste honestly spellcasters it's not as beneficial for us to have haste well depends on when you're going in if you focus on fassbender and tell him to just attack or to cast slow he will do that until that dragon is dead he will just continue without you having to focus on him that's so trite the cloak what do those do then i'll take the cloak i guess i'm going to take off my spell slot ring and i put my goodie but my oldie circlet on the mayor's the big mansion the margrave's house i can also do a feast if i cast it at seventh level but fuck it i'm going to sleep so it doesn't matter pike and i are both going to cast heroes' feast so that way we can feast 24 people total so tell kevdak sorry fuck tell zanror his finest warriors his druids-- so make sure we have zanror his wife his druids that he mentioned there were like two to three druids magic-users or clerics rise at sunrise rise at dawn 2d10 and you're immune to poison fear-- oh jeez don't let me fuck this up oh that's not bad 14 14 from me well when do we want to be at the trap dawn so we need to be in our places by 5am what time of year is it okay so we have long nights right now so let's sleep for a good six hours yeah i'm staring at you how does she see everything she's a witch wait what time is it son of a bitch we overslept i thought we were trying to get in places before dawn i hate it when i oversleep sure i also cast protection from energy resistance to acid on grog i'm going to stay in this cluster of trees with scanlan additional or temporary theoretically i could enhance your ability but it's a concentration spell and i've already protected from acid against grog what does your cloak do that i put on like melee only melee not spells yeah shit i can't believe we're doing this quiet i come over the earpiece in the calm of battle and i say if things go terribly wrong rush to this cluster of trees i have ways that can get us out i feel like i should say something inspiring but i don't have anything so-- fuck shit up as grog once said about two days ago green lucky jade that's okay fucking shit is yours not good also big ten which if you round it twice is like a thousand you've got no he has fassbender yeah i'm hyperventilating why the book thanks to whomever sent these jelly bellies by the way he's got to roll to see if it recharges it'll recharge on a five or a six oh dear god okay i'm going to transmute the earth underneath him right that's what i'm doing that's part of the plan so if i can do right underneath umbrasyl that would be fabulous it's a 120-foot range i want to do the area just directly under umbrasyl if i can so that i'm not sinking the herd around him i want to turn the ground directly underneath umbrasyl into mud okay i thought it had spread because it's 40-foot so i thought it was under umbrasyl but i could do something else-- okay plan b should i go with pillars yeah i'll go with-- no okay i'm going to cast bones of the earth which i think i can pop up six pillars around umbrasyl so grog you want a boost you want to stand on a rock pike you want a boost do you want a boost okay here's what i'm going to do i want a pillar here grog when you're ready grog on a big stone pillar bam and then where's the button pike on a pillar over here bam let's go ahead i'm trying to trap him in here i want to pin him as these go up so let's do one here can i get whoever that is up on a-- right up here oh surprise we were trying not to tell anyone our plan let's do another one over here bam pinning him in one two what is that three four one on the opposite side over here umbrasyl's a big fatty so i can't get my laser pointer over there over here-ish on the other side of this one can i raise a pillar through his wing so flanking this pillar on the other side over there if that makes-- flanking this pillar so wait move that one that you just placed over a bit you know it's fine you get the idea let's do one up here knock him in the chin hopefully that contains him a bit yeah guess so i'm behind you fuck yeah d10 he's taking a photo the hope-devourer yep umbrasyl the hope and then marriage fucked everything up come on pike can you bring him down any is this sneak attack i'm so scared okay hang on what the hell is the range on that i'm going to just take a few steps forward here-ish matt there-ish move up a little bit just so i can-- yeah just ahead of the tree and i'm going to attempt to cast earthbind on him he has to make a strength saving throw fuck i knew it well we've burned off two of his legendary resistances okay i'm going to take the remaining of my turn oh shit i actually didn't want to move it's okay i'm going to turn into an earth elemental and i'm going to take the remaining of my movement to move up-- well he has 60 feet of movement but i moved what like ten feet earlier so no i'm sorry his earthglide is-- yes 30 so he moves up 20 feet 60 feet i can tell you super fast no 30 feet you technically have a pillar that's 30 feet high adjacent to him that you can anchor it into a pillar have they all broken maybe some just came loose i rolled a two with a minus one so one not a natural one rolled a two okay i'm in tank mode so i'm good i'm an earth elemental okay as an earth elemental i want to drop into the earth and earthglide with my 60 feet-- question can i get across and to the top of this pillar here maybe that one earthglide to the top so it's 30 feet tall (nervous laughter) and i'm going to use my momentum to see if i can rocket myself out and see if i can jump and grab onto his leg yeah i want to shoot out of the pillar and shoot out with a waterslide trajectory woo yeah maybe i'm thinking about it real hard so is that strength as a-- i'm going to use scanlan's inspiration ooh that's good 18 plus five so 23 but i've got his foot and i'm heavy as fuck well if fassbender weighs what was it like 1200 pounds 2800 pounds so i'm at least as heavy if not heavier than fassbender 2000 pounds none of us fucking know why didn't we go metric yeah what are they talking about okay i'm holding on for dear life okay yeah no that's wait do i add anything sorry it did do you need more d8s hold on nice what did you have to beat even though i'm holding on to his leg that's not good four halved because i'm an elemental strength 19 that sucks he's consulting the book again he's gotta be taller than six feet 15 sounds nicer rounds up i'm not arguing we're rounding up he has 26 hit points that's going to be a lot of damage right we burned through all of his legendary saves this is awful make a little breathing hole bye taliesin we love you are you still going to be in puerto rico that long no such a death wish hope devourer maiden name hope maiden name hope
