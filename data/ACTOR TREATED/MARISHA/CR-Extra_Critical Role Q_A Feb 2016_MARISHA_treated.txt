like half rat half person i love how that's part of the announcements though you try to-- in fact maybe now's a good time to hearken back to your episode one announcement because it's been almost 50 since you've made the announcement that you like to house rule a lot of stuff yeah we leave next week along with those giveaways with lootcrate i did an espionage nail-wrap tutorial and jamie hooked me up and gave me a few critical hit nail wraps yeah you can go see how easy and awesome it is actually someone asked me at the con this weekend if i was a paid sponsor like paid promoter for espionage and the answer is no ashley johnson and i actually legitimately really love their products and are huge fans i'm just a legit fan i think i tweeted the link yesterday i'm going to go tweet it out and go check out espionage cosmetics they're great i have some on right now no that's not paint they're these they're nail wraps and you stick them on they're like stickers and you put clear coat on them and they last two weeks i could yeah i could you want to demonstrate i need a nail file i demonstrate in the tutorial but they're really great and actually do make some for dudes as well they make some that are like gender neutral yeah semantics all right so good hey where's wendy we could bring wendy out matt and she also did all the art for the winter's crest festival we're getting a chair for you here you go scooch up a little bit do it all at once damn it does it need to be that clear nothing yeah how do they mean clearly not i guess i sometimes try and go back and watch the end of the last episode so i can remember where we were yeah i also have all my spells on little cards i've got a few spell references i've got the book cards and spreadsheets i have dry erase markers and my notebooks endless notebooks i've become the token party notetaker of the group uh by the way see i have a bunch of people shouting spells at me that i should do that i may or may not have learned because druids work-- do druids work like clerics where we learn spells at the top of the day do clerics work like that like 17 well i can choose 17 that i have total and then i have four 1st-level spell slots three 2nd-level three 3rd-level three 4th-level two 5th-level one 6th-level and one 7th-level that i can use so theoretically i could learn ten level four spells but i only have three slots that i can use of those ten so i have 17 spells that i can learn that i can pull from my entire list which is like 100 spells but i have to balance it out so i have four 1st-level spell slots that i can burn so i try to pick three to four first level spells that i learn at the top of the day so when people are shouting at me over the internet going keyleth polymorph trinket polymorph him i don't necessarily have it learned i have to learn every time at the top of the day i saw someone ask if wendy was going to play with us we seem to become more committed maybe we try not to dick around in between at home we'd go hang on i've got to go can we take 45 minutes for a break i think we were pretty selfish in wanting to entertain ourselves i feel like all that was there before the show that was all there i still remember the camera guys were like all right diesel sit in frame he was like (thud) and the camera guy's like let me just scoot the camera back a little bit adjust the focus even the people who get heated or upset they're getting heated and upset at our imaginary characters that we made up in our heads so at the end of the day it's still working we're still affecting them it makes them feel that beyond that-- i know you guys you were saying you talk with kit and meg all the time and we were having the conversation not long ago all of our official artists thus far one's in los angeles one's in the uk in london one is in-- where's joma the philippines the other's in the philippines he's in sweden all of our official artists have been on different continents which is crazy yeah mikandi's in the middle east that's right and two days later the hollywood pantages tweeted scanlan just walked the red carpet the pantages whoever runs social for pantages watches critical role which is very jarring when you're drenched in sweat and you're like (untz untz untz) someone's like d&d and you're like-- i feel really sober now someone asked would you recommend playing a game with friends or finding a group made up of strangers we had a text thread going we had a few different options that we were floating around i think charisma save was being tossed around but someone else already had that we were trying to do something around dice box or dice tube or something (laughter) we had a few different ones i have an art question so while wendy is here from carbacca hey matt and the gang what scenes do you think you could describe or even act out-- that's not going to happen-- from before the stream that you would like to see drawn by us crazy fan artists because there would be no new mewments-- no new moments this week no nude movements artists need something to draw pre-stream and we tried to interrogate him because we were hoping he would know stuff-- he was like i'm a cow i don't know shit two years' worth yeah in the fetal position it was really sad we always remember the time we discovered the magic carpet too because that was so good it was so epic allura's tower which we've seen now happen on game right her tower implode cowboy in the sunset because you know kash was keyleth's first kiss right clover's so cute travis what is yours and/or grog's favorite kill that you've had i have someone here saying how detailed are our notes she just says how detailed are your notes i don't know if she's asking matt or us why don't you go first tpk'd it's like trying to argue past timelines that never existed i'm sure i have a bunch of unborn children that will never happen i don't know why i said it going off that maelyn in the chat asked if there was any more background for gilmore and going off that again stormshadow17 in chat asked are we more attached to these characters because we made them from scratch and they didn't come from a script matt and well my prom in eighth grade-- it's my bar mitzvah money a friend of mine eric campbell who's been on the stream a few times in his current d&d campaign that he's playing he's playing a guard from whitestone-- in our world-- who saw vox machina come in do these heroic feats and is like i want to be like those guys but he's got parents a nice background he's going to hit the road because vox machina inspired him and then find out how fucking terrible and awful it is he's real excited to be broken and beaten he's trying to be optimistic and a hero-- the carpet took the brunt that's right i feel really bad for you guys because liam and i were like no and you're like what the fuck is wrong with these people you could feel the pain twice like it happened twice do you want to answer that question and a lot of the players get that too and we're on the same path what do you not get that travis my favorite was still when we snuck in the back door of the clasp the first time and we were like knock-knock oh hey clasp leader hey what's up we're here to decapitate you and we didn't plan any of that and you're like oh you walk in let me start drawing real quick and starts drawing things he's like clasp leader is there it was good oh no it just went dark it's another one going off that ivar @mistbornelite asks how often do we strategize outside the game which is never really it's impossible not to think about it i'll do that honestly i think more often than not i'll be like goddamn it percy totally had the last word i should have said this i should have done this and i'll be like next time but i'll spend the week being like next time i see percy i'm going to give him a piece of my-- and it never happens travis do you think grog is unable to be corrupted by craven edge due to his lower intelligence you're too dumb to be corrupted is grog convinced that it's in his head and it's like wilson and tom hanks in castaway he told me later he thought we'd throw it into the acid with everything else that's some bullshit it's such bullshit it sucks when you're like i'm going to burn this 5th-level spell and it's going to be fucking amazing and it can't fail because the spell says-- oh legendary resistance oh what was that tweet that we got that they tagged you me and liam in it and it was like god vax's voice is so sexy hey marisha do you ask matt to do vax's voice for you i was like-- out of everything out of all the fan art fanfic now you done made it weird that's the line right there we found it only a few times getting the polearm in the face i was like really all three attacks on keyleth so many whips in the atmosphere not too bad though every game we have people being like oh shit matt's sleeping on the couch tonight and i'm like no it's fine i love it so much it's creation myth time even so though i'm generally scribbling hot words because i can't get it all oh that seems important key points someone said matt how hard was it to decide to destroy the city of emon after you spent so much time to build it additionally how early in the story planning did you decide to destroy the city and what caused you to take that route that's crazy two years he does this all the time i don't even know anymore i would say good note though please don't bring us weapons at cons don't gift us weapons we've got to fly and we have a hard time getting them home there's no smoking on the aircraft she hid it i'm pretty sure not to be confused-- whereas the billion bunny march is a bunch of strangers dressing up as bunnies and protesting the man good question marisha are you going to awaken trinket someday no i'm not no and that's my quivering palm question is are you going to awaken trinket no i can't actually trinket is literally too smart for me to awaken him and if i ever did it would mean that trinket could theoretically be like oh what you've been my master this whole time vex well fuck this shit i'm out and i don't want to ever do that so no it's her bear it's vex's bear do we want to read it the target must either have no intelligence score or an intelligence of three or less six oh sure that's why we do voiceover i was going to say were-rat was that the ravenloft campaign eventually we go god hunting ghostbusters-style god hunting if someone asks if you're a god-- marisha mary and keyleth feels some of that it's a weird feeling sometimes he has the limericks he's been writing down the limericks that's been a very new thing though he'll be like i've been listening to top 40 more recently that's pretty much all he said he's like i'm trying to listen to the radio more he's crazy he's great it's all that ucb training his story by the way at this wizard world panel yeah if anyone hasn't seen the wizard world panel he has a story of him as gavroche falling off the barricades and it was in the middle of the miami riots back in the day and he went to the hospital and was like i fell off the barricade he's all smudgy you have to watch him tell it though we can't even do it justice but it's great it's a good story remember how when we were fighting the banshees they have an ability where they can touch you and you're down ghouls have a similar ability where they touch you and you're paralyzed and you get canned so if you split up the divide and conquer technique is probably the worst that you could use against ghouls yeah pretty much i misunderstood the question it was great it worked beautifully in real life or our characters in real life red that fire-breathing man fire dragons a chromatic dragon just peaced-out-- so influential i had a question scroll by and forgive me i didn't see the name of who it was but they were asking about being a female playing d&d in an all-boy group and how you break that comfort level luckily i think especially now with the resurgence of d&d the boy's club aspect that might have been surrounding it is definitely slowly starting to get broken d&d should never be a gender-specific game at all it's tough it's also where you grew up and where you're located and the part of the country i know growing up in kentucky i didn't have access to anybody especially other females that would want to play with me but yeah if you feel uncomfortable i try to remember that it's probably a little bit of them feeling uncomfortable on their end as well so try to be open-minded to that and i think you'll get used to it but there's not supposed to be gender specifics and guys we have a ton of our players that like to rp girls we're all actors maybe the best way if you're a female in an all-guy group fuck it make a male character as well female should never be a personality trait actually there's a really great video that's on youtube that someone linked me to this past week and it was from about three years ago before the fine brothers milked this format and it was boys a group of ten-year-old boys playing dungeons & dragons with a group of girls for the first time did you see that yeah and it was great and i love kid logic because i feel like it really simplifies what we're all actually thinking on its purest form and all the boys at the end of it were super mature and were like oh this is great they were like the girls were really bloody and violent i thought they would puke at the blood i didn't know that girls could be that violent i'm like yeah man so i feel like the kids realizing that there really is no separation is quintessential how everyone feels and ultimately to be 100 percent honest i really enjoy people who have implemented dungeons & dragons in elementary schools as teaching mechanisms and there have been a lot of people who've used it for kids who have social imperatives or social awkwardness things in real life yeah totally and i think it really does teach you empathy on a different level and you really can put yourself in the shoes of someone else that you're probably nothing else like keyleth has taught me a ton playing keyleth has taught me a ton because i don't really consider myself anything like her in real life so playing something super empathetic she's taught me a lot and i think everyone can learn from that that's my tangent i'm done --cock that's a ten instead of violence we can solve this with rock paper scissors it'll be great so my armor with spell resistance i've got advantage on spell attacks against me i can get saving throws my armor that has spell resistance oh my god this is so nerve-wracking you guys grog you have plus two oh i have 14 going to get straight into this i guess i am going to cast call lightning at 5th level then i say i'm really sorry about this you guys i think this is an alternate reality though and we'll be fine if we just get out of this i can go ahead and bring down a spell right or no yeah i can the same time i'm going to go ahead and hit kashaw because i can see him through my little window i get 5d10 right sorry kash 5d10 that is a really terrible roll 17 and another one and then i take my bonus action to turn into an eagle (eagle sounds) fuck that shit shit's getting real giant eagle fly away beast shape i keep all of my mental stats 13 okay well that brings me zero to my 33 so that's nine points yeah i have a ring so 14 ooh no eight oh bad idea okay oh me again already oh my god okay well i stand up i'm going to go ahead and throw a call lightning up again this time at 4th level i think i've got a bit of a view on grog kind of know where he is i can see kash though right sorry kash (lightning crash) right on kash again i'm going to use my bonus action to do a cure wounds or sorry healing word at myself just at first level this is the shit of nightmares i want you to know that keyleth friend keyleth friend hits 18 would bring me to 40 right ooh oh that's good that's good 17 that's good for the first one and a natural one so i'll take the 17 dexterity save nine plus-- so excited ooh that's much better 20 total what are you hitting me oh you're firestorming us what does the cover grant you what's the three-quarters cover do anything i can do to fix myself while i'm out but i have to roll a nat 20 other than that that's it oh man yeah totally nope i'm also on the ground come on come on all that pent-up aggression you've been wanting to get out grog off the leash is a bad day now i'm envisioning grog's rhinoplasty god he is made of meat and hit points whenever he fails that save on finger of death that's fucking-- one for free without burning a spell slot orville yeah you will yes you are yeah thanks matt had to go into detail oh like you're going to banish him oh my god do this send him to bizarro world oh my god so many wheatons i still imagine that it's a giant floating popcorn kernel (singing) so never more shall we see you again you've done really well you are kind of taking the defensive route which is great there might be a cushy water bed in the pit you don't know oh he does have that if you get through this with one hit point-- roll a nat 20 yeah mittens is still up wow (cheering) i had a terrible dream you were there and you were there and you were there i hope i never get on grog's shit list oh by one point and the maiden voyage of the dwarven forge it looks so great falling through the sky as a dead bird well is jump in the pit considered suicidal i want to get into some kilgrave shit but would hey explore the bottom of this pit be considered a suicidal action what spell oh right do we have any giveaways that we need to announce giveaway winners i know there was so much stuff to give away yeah sure giveaway brandon sanderson books and nail wraps what was the book called again i feel like it was that scene in sleepy hollow in the end where the lighthouse is on fire then grog walks out of it that's what i envision be active check out the bands of mourning and espionage cosmetics they have nerdy makeup nerd makeup it's a thing matt marisha
