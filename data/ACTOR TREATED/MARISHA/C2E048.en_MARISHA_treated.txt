don't let travis lie to you he's got a half-er pub draw spoilers he doesn't know yet that's such strong feelings i think i just got his name as wharfmaster male dwarf matted beard thick gold hoops and i brush my hair i grab one of avantika's coats rip the sleeves off of them put it on my kind of woman i'll go to the blacksmith with the guys what's your name by the way dreef beau yeah like a staff yeah i do actually do you sell staffs i know are you all really just making this connection really pull out my bo staff i put it away and i smack fjord in the face as i put my staff back your lip's bleeding thanks yeah it's a little poofy yeah that's a good one man i had good aim on that (whispering) so tragic sam attempted to have a dad moment and it failed it's a very unhealthy relationship with pink yes beat me to it yes it would have been so cool yeah it would've just you know as a historical landmark the tide peak like a dick what happens in the cold it's just a player's handbook what class do you play we've got a little bit of time we still don't know how to get into this tower maybe we could do a little bit more research before the night is out before dinner time ask questions i don't know i'll chip in for one 60 gold yeah let's buy them out two hours the wayfarer's cove-- the open quay what do you mean it's not there anymore did we do that i don't know yeah could you get stuck no doors nothing i get this feeling that this is all a forced perspective thing like an illusion what if we get in there and it's actually just a shack maybe he's an enthusiast of tiny homes compensating i don't know just a theory i mean what do we want out of this right yeah but then what to immediately be arrested and thrown out of nicodranas no there definitely is it's called breaking and entering there is a rule about that what's it sound like (sound of running feet) walking casual hello with yussa yussa errenis it would be really fantastic to talk to him yes or at least if you can inform us how to make an appointment maybe it's his assistant listen i'm sure you've heard about the war that's happening in the empire we have reason to believe that people with magical interests might be threatened in this time of war and having heard that ooh-sah might be a man magical prowess we thought that he might have some information or at least we could hand off our fair warning what was your name tomorrow morning yeah it turns out you could just knock we talked to a little goblin accountant dude made an appointment for tomorrow morning but not really an appointment an off-the-books appointment toss it like seaworld sorry it shouldn't have come out of my mouth it's inherently untrustworthy yeah honestly it was the path of least resistance that surprised me as well i'm used to things being difficult maybe i just make things difficult maybe i'm having a moment of self-realization anyway we have a ton of magical secrets laura and we have the happy fun time ball we witnessed an attack on another wizard's tower in zadash i wasn't lying when i said magic people might be under attack i know i don't think we have to offer the dodecahedron either we have our eyewitness accounts of-- don't get me wrong caleb is very smart i know we all know that-- but you guys have noticed he's not necessarily the best talker right well you can justify anything i feel like we're bonding why have you never told me this before you should have led with that is that bad dope yeah appointment in the morning he said come back in the morning we told him it was an emergency so we still have to go forward with that for you but what is going to be an emergency for a man that's not threatened by the things that you're threatened by is no one into talking about the tower getting attacked in zadash we could just make nice conversation and ask for a book oh god i'm starting to sound like caduceus look at the end of the day this guy has access right making him our ally in some way could come in useful even in ways we might not be aware yet she's so poignant when she speaks well this guy is anti-clovis concord so i don't know i don't think he's-- i have a feeling this guy is a bit of a rogue agent in terms of-- right because the clovis concord-- sorry a little repeat of the concord they're like the government for menagerie like an oligarchy they're anti this guy because he's outside of their-- i just wrote down the chagrin of the clovis concord so i'm assuming that's what she said jester it's an emergency earl grey natural one we don't have earl grey from zadash from the empire eliminate your enemies maybe he'll see us looking at it i look up at yussa is he watching i go in before we went in i wanted to-- can i bring frumpkin yep frumpkin give me frumpkin do you not want to see in this fuck it i'll leave he won't give me his damn cat sure i deeply-- you have a morning routine oh that's impressive-- sorry deeply apologize for interrupting we're from zadash we are a hired mercenary group here to deliver very specific information from zadash about an attack that happened on the zauber spire well it is a joint effort between the hall of erudition and the cobalt soul a lot of people are banding together now that war is on the home front so unlikely alliances are happening all across the continent just a friendly passing off of information of course if you would like to discuss alliances yes i guess just a friendly passing of information and that maybe you would like to exchange information in return if you might know anything fantastic thank you uh (laughter) well as we mentioned the xhorhasian army has breached into the empire we witnessed an attack from crick assassins on the tower sorry he wasn't with us at the time but the rest of us did witness an attack and encountered the xhorhasian ourselves correct i see you've heard beyond that we've recently heard that the xhorhasians have reached felderwin our group has been on the ocean in search for further information on behalf of the empire you're not wrong we got word halfway through in a jungle that a lesser god that likes to go by the name of uk'otoa might have some sway in everything that's going on i don't think so i think he's on the verge of returning and i think there might be followers and patrons who might be aiding that cause we have reason to believe that maybe some xhorhasian spies and soldiers might be worshipers of uk'otoa we've received a vision through mystical means that i do not feel comfortable sharing of a potential location for where uk'otoa is captured a jungle landscape somewhere on the continent you wouldn't happen to have any ideas would you okay beyond that-- we found a thing (aside) which thing should i tell him about it was presented to us as the happy fun time ball stumbled upon us through a little girl i think she thought it was a toy seems like everyone is getting butterfingers with their magical items or magical folk do you not find it concerning that the savalierwood is on the borderlines of the xhorhasian empire mm-hmm yeah i actually knew that i'm sure you have very keen eyes and you saw the artifact that i was looking at before i entered into this tower it appears to be a magical geometric orb that has the ability to bend elements of time and space and fate i've seen into it we mentioned we were not your ordinary folk so as you can see things happen to fall into our lap we need allies as you mentioned we have very powerful artifacts that we're not very sure about but our options are turning them over to the empire which doesn't seem attractive depends depends on who's offering at the time correct i know i tend to like fellow trustworthy people even though i'm not necessarily trustworthy myself but ironically i fucking hate untrustworthy people so if you're down i'm down is what i'm saying no i didn't say i didn't have loyalty i said i had loyalty to these people of course and i have a few slots open in my loyalty bank so if you're willing to pay the price of rental-- yeah we all know corruption runs rampant in both the empire and the clovis concord i don't want anything to do with that i just want the truth this is not my fucking best i'm better at lying that's not too bad 18 did i yeah sure the mighty nein beauregard how about a non-monetary exchange do you have any type of scrolls or spell books-- or candy that you could lend to caleb's aid further advancing his ability to learn that as traveling mercenaries we're used to being in danger (quietly) it does zadash after the spire attack either it was in the tri-spire and they successfully exited with it or the xhorhasian were trafficking it that's what we believe yussa do you know of the empire the clovis concord stealing artifacts from other shores we haven't showed-- oh bourbon it sounds really good it's like a red lobster biscuit some places call them lobster rolls how'd it go how'd it go was it made of marble thank you i could barely speak i could barely get words out see access that's what i said earlier he's smart you met a rockstar and you look like you want to barf access the international sign for entrance for let me in thank you it started out as a half-truth we got there without exposing anything too deeply he might think we work for the empire oh no not like that thought about it though worst case scenario flash a guy see what happens i did tell him-- wait i did tell him about-- how'd you know that jester am i talking about my slots too much fuck yeah good with me caleb i didn't lie to him not really anyway so believe what you want and i walk away if we go through alfield we can check in on our old contact bryce is bryce in alfield they're in alfield right sorry oh no yeah no we-- yeah i forgot about this we've done this before the way you did in zadash okay okay yeah field is that what we were looking for yeah yeah yeah costa rosta nine do we have anything bad and one of these nights i talk to jester you have that spell that you can talk to people send them messages very far away how far away that's awesome i do could you do one of those for me to somebody is that a thing you can do her name is dairon she was a roommate at the cobalt soul she taught me a lot of really great things i just want to make sure she's okay because she got sent to the war front on the xhorhasian coast yeah i think she's fine she was just there to check it out when we were still in zadash last time that i was there i talked to her and she was leaving and then went back and she hadn't come back yet so it's been a few months she's got a shaved head and she wears dark-colored clothes she's got super buff muscles-- 'cause she's been working out you know i-- we've had good times i think that's just the thing i have notes somewhere in here yeah i'm meditating on dairon and as i meditate i-- hey girl-- heading to felderwin this is beau might be heading to zadash after that you know if you're in the area hit me up booty call call me back nope oh right but she kn-- yeah ooh she'll be gone for the next month to the bladegarden to help with the assault she's in bladegarden narrow it down i told her that though before she sent it that she was in bladegarden because i would have known that just straight intelligence lucky jade okay okay okay 17 natural 15 she's got a longer nose pointed-- fierce eyebrows thanks dungeon master what really-- i mean-- sure what oh okay okay really thanks jester that's a big deal okay what me yeah 'sup what was that okay did he say something to you about your past when you were in there with him you think he saw into you you're a man of-- the man in rexxentrum or yussa do you have to go or do you want to go because what i'm hearing from you caleb is that you don't understand that you have friends we're here willing to defend you and kick some ass just like we did for fjord-- is it though caleb unfortunately you don't get to choose who cares for you it's not a choice you get to make you can either accept this-- what do you want we can't find anything out if we don't talk to people if we're not careful i don't like not knowing either caleb it's why i thought i would talk to people i thought you'd be excited i thought i did a damn good job in there i thought me and caduceus both did i was talking to nott and we thought for damn sure that you would be so stoked about this goddamn fucking tower wow (shouting) wow fucking cool caleb yeah he's cool (shouting) you're cool caleb see jester thinks you're fucking cool because she's your fucking friend (even louder) sorry fjord yeah do we-- thanks that's exactly what i think you wouldn't happen to have any handwriting samples of some lawmasters i know but for more other ones other than you know stolen mail sign-in sheets even great we don't have to arrest you yep yep oh no (whistles) oh shit okay caleb you recognize those people my notes look like a serial killer's it's bad antiquity at the cerberus-- largemont mld oh jeez he's homeland security wait archmage of what fuck domestic protection same i mean did you want to finish that i have an idea i have my opinion i'm just curious– someone was interrogated what was yours nott you clearly have some personal attachment to this what would someone want from here yeah that guy mentioned people feeling slow time yeah gravity and time we have a beacon yeah we have a piece of dunamis i think jester's right i think this dodecahedron goes into that tripod i don't think we should do it here because like yussa said we pull this thing out selectively your people it's because they haven't-- he hasn't in terms of-- oh wow yeah can i actually do a little pass on the chair and see if i see any signs that someone's been tied to it someone's been questioned things that beau would know that people would do in her realm aww jesus fucking christ 13 we already knew that yeah i agree fjord someone's come back in whoever-- well the chair is facing the chest correct is what you said i mean look at the amount of time that we've all lost staring in the dodecahedron nott where do we go you said old edith i agree with fjord i don't think they necessarily found what they were looking for when they came here but i think they didn't find it and they might move on i'm making guesses like the rest of us none of us can honestly tell you what the right call is here i think we all need to talk sam riegel rip ears don't at me
