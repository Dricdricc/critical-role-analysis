him he's really funny and this coming up episode might be one of my favorite ones yes that's a true story anyway give him love go watch it it's funny it's very funny and he has great things that he boosts what was my character's name i know but what was my character's name look a lot's happened in a couple weeks okay i've moved i've had a change of scenery-- oh wait i haven't seen this yet i knew this day would come didn't we discuss sending him home vax just because he's holding a dagger doesn't mean he's going to be successful at using it you're wasting your time-- never mind heh natural 19 29 no i'm sorry 30 30 i rolled a 19 my perception's 11 i look at the group and i go-- okay okay it looked like there were two orcs and they were carrying a body no they're headed away from us correct away they're going away thank goodness 22 you got a natural 20 there won't be tracks if they're dead where where where can you point out those barrels one more time yeah but i'm full on hit points is anyone hurt flank them as they're running-- well scanlan can create a distraction i can possibly take a few people out with my ranged spells along the way not today let scanlan handle-- i almost called him scandal which is still appropriate let scanlan handle the door i can handle the distraction you are you're incredibly good at distractions where's scanlan where did you go scanlan yeah we want to do it towards us yes no that's where we wanted-- put us more-- no that's good that's good that's good sure can i have a monster manual conjure woodland beings maybe well i can conjure a bunch of little creatures yeah but then it wouldn't be me it'd be something else that's not me that i can control okay i'm going to say conjure woodland beings i don't know well that's what i'm trying to figure out you know there's not a list of what you can conjure in the book and it's very unfortunate and it's some kind of fey creature so what's a fey creature that's a challenge rating of two that would make sense that's really scary or i can also summon like eight fairies if they're a low enough you know-- yeah it says the dm will have the statistics dryads that sounds cool challenge rating of two it's got to be a fey oh it only has a challenge rating of one laura and what are centaurs apparently okay well then let's do two dryads two triads dryads i don't know what it is two dryads right in where-- thank you yep here ish here no there yeah that's a little out and scanlan and i are far back see aren't you glad that wasn't me that wasn't us wasn't me it's all i care about keyleth is standing at the edge of the forest going-- wait can i go with you a little bit can i do a thing with him just avoid the pit oh that's a good roll spent all that time figuring out what i was going to do and then they fell in a crack 21 21 the door's already summoned yeah okay you mentioned that a few were coming over and looking over at the edge of the pit are there still a few more at the edge of the pit sure how far away is that guy from the pit okay here's what i want to do i'm going to go earth elemental but i want to like do it like a badass you know so i see scanlan-- fuck i did use scorpion fuck damn it we haven't taken a short rest then i don't do any of that instead where's scanlan did we are you sure all right fine okay so i walk and i sink into the ground as i'm walking off and i want to pop up next to this guy and i want to throw his ass in the pit (cheering) territory strength check 17 he's going to get crushed he's going to crush the dryad yeah wwpd what would pike do 17 is my natural armor remember the love in your heart (laughs) walk around aggressively yeah yeah yeah (laughter) yes totally indy-ed it silently oh no okay i'm going to take the two dudes who are in front of me you can tell me if i can do this twice or not i want to do my multi-slam attack my multi-attack slam and i want to go in as dictated in common as i can as an earth elemental knock knock and i want to take their heads and go boof-boof against each of them okay natural 19 on the first one and a natural 18 on the second (rock voice) knock-knock (normal voice) first attack is 13 plus-- 18 points second not as good ten points can i take his body and chuck it in the hole it served its purpose yeah hey i brace paladin or some shit like that ouch keyleth was like aw cute (screams) damn wait i'm getting attacked by someone else too yeah both of those hit 24 whose his two guys and a bear with charlie sheen new to cbs is this against the bear can't even kill a kitten who's left alive are we still trying to keep one alive sure all right yeah sure i want to earth glide underneath and pop up underneath of him the fire guy yeah yeah that's cool first i want to stamp him out in the fire in the snow sorry stamp out his fire in the snow and then i'm going to i want to grapple onto him i want to start dragging him over to this nearby tree athletics i've only got basic stats here oh 19 20 20 okay can i start dragging him over so-- okay i'll slowly start dragging him to this tree over here so we can tie him up okay come on (rock voice) grog and i put him in a nice little sleeper hold are there any other prisoners still tied up i was going to say before i drop my earth elemental form i start busting open some of these crates for quick lootage (laughs) that's awesome it's always the kids man it's always the kids i drop elemental form and start helping pike heal whoever needs healing two dryads yeah can we take a short rest but seriously i eat some because i'm-- keyleth's a little hungry no never said that wait check it out and then your door is stationary though right darkvision is 60 feet i wrote it down oh boy grog you did sleep last night right and of course don't forget to tune in next week for our 50th episode shall we up the mountain i'm assuming you told us when you got back frost-willem dafoe jif then i'll light up my hands a little bit oh elvish wait so percy read this out loud right would keyleth know anything about this as possibly being a portal to the realm of water can i do like a check to see if this is something that might be a-- not my strong suit i'm so smart just straight intelligence 15 okay i pull out my hunk of quall hunk of quall i also happened to pack control water in my bag of tricks today i did when we go underground there tends to be water so i tend to bring it keyleth walks up and puts her hands in the pool anything happen when i touch the water i dive in not great two plus two is that however long your-- interesting how far does the tunnel look bad and bad 16 16 you want to keep going marisha and 15 15 what what the why what the why dolphins with lasers upon seeing this i reach forward and i grab hold of him and i cast control water and jettison the both of us out of there i kicked the camera sorry i take a jet jetting us back out waterslide help can i take the control water to see if i can like waterbend it out of his lungs if there's any water in his lungs really nasty plants and i go over i'm pretty sure my control water lasts for a minute yeah dope i'm going to go over and can i start clearing the water out of this tunnel out that's what i was thinking making like an air tunnel and how big was this tunnel that's a big tunnel i'll part it yeah i yell to everybody else and i say there's a tunnel through to the other side let's go and i jump in and i'll sink and i'll start parting the water behind me or let me see let me sink to the bottom and then i'll part the water in the tunnel straight ahead and before i jump in i say don't touch the plants on the edge yeah that's what i'm hoping for yeah let's go fast while i still have this concentration sure displacement physics okay don't touch the plants let's go forward following up their rears they're assholes don't touch them can i take the control water and jettison us all up like i did with grog hold on three-point landing those things are death traps man they're the best what does it say hang on the ones who made us-- because we killed one of them if you recall there were also five dragons and we killed one of them already it's the water cycle it could it said the water a door wait and the hole is right above the water correct it lines up it lines up does this harken back to anything that we remember about the telling of the spark or the second spark all of the elemental realms overlap which create our realm which is why there's gateways i gave vex the hunk of quall just hold it out like you're searching for a signal yeah it means that there's magical essence it finds magic good call percy well i druidcraft some earth and start wrapping it around the pillar gather close next to me who's close nearby i do a wall of stone as a pillar and pillar us up towards the hole elevator time can i at least rise us up to where we're close and we can get there where we're up and out i do have the immovable rod here catch yeah take it i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to go and turn into a bird i'm flying it's gone it's gone so the only people that are left are percy and grog can i cantrip a gust against the sand to try and blow some of it grog i cantrip gust brush him off yeah i never trust that that's never been good what did that riddle say something about a name a name must be earned so maybe this is us earning our name and wind is there any runes or anything around in this room that look like they would indicate-- well do you want to bust out those ioun stones you have you also have your ioun stones upon hearing this keyleth drops to her knees and does a locate creature do i sense any spiders i think we're good on spiders and is there anything behind the webs just rubble i agree i think this looks like a convergence-of-the-elements type of a room i can light a fire in that pit you know we've always found that very offensive i just want to say that so this is going over the firepit past the wispy-- yeah i'll take the left no yeah we're moving very slowly not disturbing the air we have no fucking clue the golden snitch lives i have the worst initiative rolls all the time except for earlier today seven what is his name percy nice saving throw correct 23 22 23 issylra is a continent right okay i yell out issylra okay that might be a continent not his name and i cast control water again and i start pouring the water out of the pools and onto the fire okay well i stop that good to know can i do some sort of check to see if i would've heard anything about this type of a thing in my druid time is this like a different plane of existence what is this shit yeah or would i know of what his name would be from the telling of the second spark and any of my elemental knowledge as a druid ooh that's good 19 fuck i don't know you guys no i'm good paul was here what well that's a better roll but doctor who 18 i know we were thinking about that time vex jumped in the water cool also look how attractive that map is dwarven forge everybody yeah there's a correlation with blue i have lots of theories too oh son of a bitch all right you're on the one on the left yeah i can i'm close by i'm close by i can handle it that's ashley that's pike yeah yeah whispers yeah how long is his name you already did water i'm wondering if there's anything in the other one or i might try fire k-a-j-i k-a-j-i but it could be any fucking order wait wait wait did anyone take note of the order on the cycle sam and never mind okay seeing vex jump in and seeing percy stick his head in a wall i run up to the fire column right there and see if there's anything in the fire and i take the fire hand and i stick it and i light up my fire and i stick it in the fire does anything happen okay okay i pull it out and i go fire elemental and i stick my head go into the fire into the flame (cheering) i pull my head out and i go m-a-l the letters m-a-l against scanlan oh jesus christ good call you are you are it's pike it's got to be pike do i use my fire elemental constitution 14 14 fuck me 24 come on grog snap out of it okay question as a fire elemental i can fly right it says that i can oh movement it doesn't really say it says i can move through a space as narrow as one inch wide without squeezing can't fly so if i go into that portal i'm going to be in the same fucking situation i'm assuming okay i'm going to drop my elemental form-- you still have my immovable rod okay before i drop elemental form i'm going to go pick up the rod it's so i can move faster pick up the rod drop my form the immovable rod and do i still have movement now as myself i'll step forward a square no the other way yeah yeah and say vex catch yeah i think so i think that's all i can do o-r-i malkaoriji hang on wait before you move it before you move it put it back put it back put it back okay i want to write it down hits miss hits miss maybe if we ask nicely he'll make us young again 17 shit we're doing all right maorikaji and kaorijimal you should try that one are we young again that's true oh my god you guys are never going to experience this ever again hi at about that time i lift up my shoulder and i show him the slayer's take symbol mythcarver what was that called again we can look at that list so i can make some serious notes i think we each need to be outfitted with something we need our legendary weapons you guys fenthras is that what it was-- no oh my god it's midnight
