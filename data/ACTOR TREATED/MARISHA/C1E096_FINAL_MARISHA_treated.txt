i wonder if she'll be nice and tanned oh that's true that's true do you use charlie to clean up the shavings yeah jodie yeah like what are the eisners and why eisner and why do we care it was hannah mahoney it was good you should watch it she's got a cool name yeah hannah mahoney that's a dope name but yeah go check it out yeah most definitely and we're filming again soon we're filming soon maybe someday sam will come on maybe someday bailey will come on maybe someday ashley will come on it's a mystery i just assumed you're not interested 'cause you've never been i still wanna make sportsball but you won't let me i wanna make it with you see he says no how about this will you come on signal boost and we can do a pseudo-pilot test of sportsball with signal boost would you do that see and he wonders why i didn't ask wow wait is it a cube it is not a cube is it nope can't get that from ldn cannot promise that from legendary nope not for a twitch show if you make it an alpha show then i can get you money (laughter) they know it's true just like we all know our logo looks like a weed shop sign we all know it's true i should probably stop saying this stuff it might be a breach of contract let's keep going (laughter) maybe keep an eye on them make sure they don't have sticky fingers talk to wilhand percy i have a question ogden in his ramblings mentioned a shadowy figure with burning coal eyes this doesn't sound like anything that you're familiar with does it how did orthax take his form with you no glowing eyes but you think it might still be of the same fiendish nature should we bring wilhand back here well how about you guys go on your tour-- yeah theoretically yeah just a little just so when historians look back and they want a detailed timeline of our lives we'll see you in 24 hours you're making a derby hat that's appropriate i turn to jb real quick oh my question has been answered by their arrival so never mind it was how long does ogden take to get ready in the morning but now i know hey vax yeah i'm sitting next to you there's no ceiling i think he fell asleep with his eyes opened you know i heard a recipe the other day for a beer-mosa it's like a mimosa but with beer and orange juice would you like a beer-mosa ogden okay okay you know i'm kind of sad i'm missing this tour with you guys now yeah it's gonna be fun what did we do we're the worst we are consistently the worst keyleth bows and i take vax with me by hitting the back of his knees oh she's coming with us you're on your own i don't think you want to do a goose-step you sure okay have fun yes and grog is like sherpa-ing we're gonna go find wilhand we're gonna go find willhand is he wearing like a lolita hat is that what's going on derby week is this weekend i think you look like an old southern white woman do you know of a tree that's close by his house that we can just be right there can i get us to that tree okay that tree psew the gate was open the side gate no the back door the back door got it i loved sleeping outside though did you guys have like a tree canopy thing that's good living taryon it's very freeing i light it up with my flame hands a penis is 'penis' a bad word insight check 24 no hang on wait wait wait i keep forgetting my insight went up 26 wilhand if you don't mind me asking i know you mentioned to pike before about a blood curse do you actually believe in the curse or do you believe that it's because of the life the trickfoots lead i know you've worked hard to get away from them plus she single-handedly helped lead the rebuilding of a sarenrae temple in vasselheim why do you think ogden is dastardly what did he do just going off what you said wise words pike is there anything you need from here before we leave stale blondie (gasps) what not everyone can be a dope adventurer all right you're making a blank can i do a nature check-- i'm kind of jelly why didn't we get lacewood you have a really big room pike yeah not that i'm comparing i'm just it's very nice when you list it out like that really weird you drink a lot of wine it's hard to take you seriously ever but even more so now with that ridiculous hat i feel like we're not one to speak on curses and bad things not existing that was cranberry juice grog and that was a solid opinion um i could look at his face and his weird tics and deduce very hard 25 you thought it was truth serum yeah yeah i was kinda with you there okay hang on i mean we're as taryon said awesome i was being generous if we just go through with this is there any harm in that hate greed pride any of the seven deadly sins man i feel like we're really getting off the point why did you use an sat word matt why very fit ogden at dinner the other night said that each generation is affected by a blood curse and he believes it's you in this generation because you and jb are in the same age right so you're the same generation so maybe percy's theory isn't quite wrong i don't know or isn't just in case right but what if it goes out of pike and into her man so many variables i mean maybe ogden just isn't telling you things because he's so old it's locked away and he doesn't remember you know how long does it last it's an interview you don't look like you're reading someone's mind when you're doing it right you don't look in her ear-- don't you have that divine intervention-y thing that dear sarenwae-- sarenrae is it four days and on that night four nights from tonight are there trees nearby are there trees nearby i can get us close we can also travel via being clouds like we've done in the past or we can just hike and enjoy the scenery it is a nice hike the canyons yeah it's rained a lot this winter so okay if it's two and a half days' journey and we're planning on doing this then we would have to take ogden and the gnomes and all things needed for this ritual right it means we would at least be framing it like we're committing i mean that gives you a long hike to be able to talk and mind-read the gnomes while we walk it gives you a solid good minute of hiking to read the gnomes all right wait shades coming from you you don't look shady (strained laughter) wait i feel like a story was starting well two and a half days i can teleport us closer and then we can either hike or cloud the rest of the way with the gnomes or the tree stride or teleport via plants and there's how many gnomes four then we'd leave one behind okay it would take a slot out of our ten wait from here to the base of the mountain with my tree-stride with the gas let's go glamping but as long as i can sleep afterwards i do that we're not leaving tonight right tonight this is the same night we got back and the lavender and sulfur what if what you're seeing ogden and i mean no disrespect in any way is a possible outcome or future that might not ever happen and as percy and tary as the science bros have said several times at least a negative outcome is still an outcome or something like that yeah we'll learn things for science you need a pound of it i was tree-striding us all to the base of the mountain right that's what i'm doing okay double-gas no i'm gonna take tary i'm making a trip back i'm gonna take tary pike the gnomes vax me how many's left that's it right and grog will go why don't you guys start off on the rug that is a good idea that's what i'll do i'll tree-stride some through i'll meet you there (sings) butterfly in the sky marisha ashley and really i would've told them well time to pitch a tent and make it fabulous it's hard to see with the blue light it could be this monitor i don't know it takes pike 24 hours to cast this so we have to protect her for 24 hours yeah i'll go by that spire closest to you yeah little close to the stalagtite yeah thank you common elven celestial-- sorry sylvan druidic primordial 15 oh sorry eight sorry you just shot at it you didn't do anything including a hex was percy not in the circle before that's interesting and trinket was am i in the circle of what i know-- pike okay hearing vex figure this out i'm gonna step forward just a little bit into the sulfur line and then i'm gonna cast moonbeam right overtop of him at fourth level and see what happens moonbeam so a shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage and if it fails it instantly reverts to its original form if it's a shapechanger but i don't really know i'm just guessing kinda harnessing the moon you know yeah moon goddess shit yeah i'll kind of shift towards the front of the column so i have the column behind my back yeah what was the bead thing is it piercing wow top of its turn it takes 4d10 of damage is it safe to like over my earpiece say like-- oh sorry what's going on what play it out okay i want to step forward a little bit can i make out details of the space of the faces that are in it can i do a perception check to see if i recognize either pike's face in there or ogden's face or any of the gnomes' face do i recognize any faces my whole action okay great 17 okay and that's my whole action okay that's my action how many fucking pastries did they take come on pike so wait that's johann or what's-his-name and his wife where the fuck is jb yeah right what's that what is that oh shit i'm going to go after johann and astra and can i do an entangle spell around her i haven't done an entangle in a second-- give me a second beat a 20 bitch do it do it do it ranger can i take her and grasping vine and throw her into my entanglement and just keep all of them entangled i tighten the grasp on them and i go and down it was more the principle of the matter i release my spell where did ogden's staff go when it got jettisoned out of him i'm going to go gather it real quick i'm going to cast detect magic on it no i don't have that i have dispel magic hey tary does this look like anything to you does this look magical can you tell here you go tary there it is i'm like this motherfucker has more hit points than a fucking dragon what the shit is going on
