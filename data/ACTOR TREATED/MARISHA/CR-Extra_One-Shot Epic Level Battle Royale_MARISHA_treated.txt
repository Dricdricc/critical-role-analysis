you can do this how about instead of a speech can i cast freedom of movement on myself i think i'm the only one here i don't know i can't i rolled pretty good too also 19 bullshit bullshit fucking mr sneak attack don't say that i've lost all of them just my modifier my straight modifier i rolled a 15 for 17 total that's your saving throw learn your character sheet motherfucker (laughing) i was so stoked about my 17 this is the last time we're going to play these characters hey question clarification on blindsight i was going to look it up you're blind but you can still see through you being awesome yeah okay so i wouldn't be able to see through scanlan's invisibility with blindsight that's what i was getting clarification on i am going to cast sunbeam at 6th level and-- sunbeam myself as an action i get to create a beam right okay well then how about this i want to peek around this corner over here do i see percy okay then i'm going to do sunbeam did i destroy the door is that what you're saying sorry i checked out (laughter) is that versus my spell level it's pretty high that hits so you are not blinded but you do still take the damage half as much 6d8 radiant (counting) 33 damage total and then i use my bonus action to turn into an earth elemental i still have a little bit of movement right i'm going to use the rest of my movement to peek back around there i saw you right under the table live dick pics do i get any-- 15 total no 16 that makes a difference feels like about 45 pounds oh sorry 75 pounds four-foot five that seems tall the inside circles i don't trust that oh no we've got an idea of where he is i was going to say does he win the battle just waits oh shit i want to go hm bink bink oh hey scanlan (laser noise) i'm going to sunbeam the gnome wait but i've already cast it it's a concentration spell fuck yeah you save against it 27 plus five so 32 he already did oh no wait oh concentration and i'm going to use the rest of my movement to go-- i'll go there what did you lose oh your spider climbing is gone too that sucks no i don't have anything to do never mind are you going to say that every time someone gets hit might want to save your shit but all right 13 can i do the locomotion and do a traveling dance how long does this last i have to spend an action what kind of saving throw jesus such a fascinating game give it time dude okay i don't see anyone in my what is it called in my terran language i say you fucking asshole and as i'm dancing i'm going to try and make my wisdom saving throw because i can't do anything else don't fuck me gil you totally fucked me no wait no you kind of fucked me what's seven plus 14 21 question because it's cast on my elemental form if i switch wild shapes will it go away okay i'll use my bonus action to turn into a fire elemental it only knocks it out for a round or for when it's turned on i have a question would freedom of movement negate the dance spell it says for the duration the target is unaffected by difficult terrain and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained damn it i love this dj you know what i'll take that enjoy the show scanlan technically my office so it's an even stronger statement you just m'lady lightning struck me this is so great no that was a natural one so i take it how much was it you would do that for me that's true love right there switching masks give me this shit i want to save from it natural 20 (grunting) bink do i see scanlan (laser noise) sorry sunbeam oh i have a bonus though i will use my bonus to go back to earth elemental this is open right can i do a big old jump into it i do that don't fuck with me like that i took you seriously for a good two seconds oh those were good rolls too come on believe in yourself man you did very much so who's on deck you are no stay hang out that's pretty bad man that's real bad do i feel anything around me 60 feet okay and no one's been in here right you tried to go in there and then failed i'm going to go (roars) and then use my siege abilities to just beat down the wall five plus seven is 12 24 plus five okay i'll go ahead and open that 30 feet walking okay this is like a building right okay i'm in there then is he close enough to where i feel a body go (thud) damn it what did matt just say we all know you have

good yeah then i just made it no i'm totally good can i take grog and use my slam attacks my multiattack to take him and body slam into this chest yeah sure my strength versus his yeah i'm just an elemental it doesn't tell me that i rolled a natural 18 so that puts me at 23 which is a slam attack to hit 17 which isn't great six plus three nine plus five so 14 damage did it release a poison trap in any way i'm immune to poison does he take poison at the top of each turn that hits for sure ooh it's pretty good did i break any potions that were under him when i slammed him into the chest i'm going to take my movement to get the fuck out of here can i go 20 use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental and then dive under this water all of them yeah archdruid shit that ends my turn can't hear shit i'm stealthing if that was not clear hiding under there stand here yeah you beat me to it good man you beat me last time with a really high roll i'm going to come out of the water like the swamp thing i'm going to beam grog with another sunbeam your half damage is a ten (counting) 21 not a great roll this go around i'm going to go into my earth elemental form and-- is this an actual window here okay yeah sure he can't hear shit it's a patio heater man we get so catty when we can it's so much fun we're never mean to each other you guys i like your crown okay that's fun that's one spell i wish we got to use more in-campaign it's a fun one this is going to be bad 12 all right let's go for a ride whee yeah a hundred percent just a straight con save not good seven this is like some freddie krueger shit that was the blue spheres i'm going to use my bonus action to turn into an air elemental and fly i'm so hot so sexy my fly speed 90 feet how many rounds has it been do we know roughly nine rounds then i'll use my last round to-- --of sunbeam this is my last round right i'm going to fly directly above percy looking down over top of him a good 60 feet almost exactly and right below me going to do my sunbeam down on top of his head fuck fucking no one did fucking everyone 25 damage i'll fly that way to that corner don't look at me like that as the elemental yes it's my sunbeam that i've been rolling concentration checks against i'm war caster with pretty high wisdom so i'm trying to make it easier to not fail a concentration check oh do i see scanlan (helicopter imitation) lapd (helicopter imitation) yeah end of my turn i would like to say i feel like i've been playing pretty aggressively waiting for that first blood waiting for it oh poor timing oh good call yeah okay stealthy pants mcgee followed by a homer simpson into the bushes followed by that kid that's like oh shit as he runs by how did you get up the tower i'm trying so hard okay so grog is suspended being repeatedly beaten into the ceiling and i saw a black streak go this direction and i know percy's somewhere in the tower but i don't know where okay yeah let me just try and find people i'm going to fly over top of where that is and see if i can see anything i'm going to look for a stealthy vax how much movement was that okay do i see anything from my awesome aerial perspective can i use the rest of my action to move down to just move let me drop down 60 feet or half my movement speed or something like that right that's my turn did you make fog did you do fog cloud ooh the m-word and percy shot you he's going to use all of his spells to just healing word 1d4 at a time no but here i'm going after vax too ba ra ra oh wait we decided i can because it's telepathic i'm trying to find my boyfriend he fucking ditched me at this bar fucking asshole oh your other boyfriend okay oh sure sorry this is a big-ass map i'm going to look around no sign of vax i'm assuming scanlan he's too fucking stealthy i'm going to go punk grog and then i'm going to fly up within 60 feet of him i can't find him i looked he's not going to let me do another perception check i tried i'm going to go up and be like sorry grog and hit him with a blight spell let's say level-- let's say a level five blight 49 points of necrotic damage where'd that minus 16 go 49 42 plus seven is 49 right sorry next is the blue so let me go to that back corner a bit more that's good remember when there were water beds good times terrible for your back 9th-level healing word do it i'm so stealthy i've lost myself going assassin this time or thief you were assassin last time goddamn it you are the literal worst so wait is the fog cloud there or no no he means it is literally out i'm going to hover over-- first smoke where there's smoke there must be a vax so i'm going to hover over a little bit move me up 30 feet or so or 60 feet that's good and then i'm going to be like hey boo i recognize that spell that's some druid shit and then i'm going to light up the entire area with a fire storm radiating outward ten of them all damage at least i've taken out all y'all's health potions that was part of the goal i'll back up a little bit trying to stay away from scanlan wait what's your range if i drop down behind the tower could i not be seen by percy fly across this way that's your only evasion that you have right until you get hit you can keep doing that until-- wait but i thought you have one that gives you half damage and one that's all damage a reaction to quote the rogue you don't know they're climbing flippers i thought the circles were going the fires did i get behind goddamn it that's fine dex saving throw 15 i am immune to grapple he put a time limit on this whole thing it's a bottle rocket oh wait nope okay my turn i've got a prone grog in front of me i'm going to do something great right shit but what to do (grumbles) oh god sorry grog i'm going to try this one more time i'm going to land i'm going to drop my form i'm going to say don't save against this and i'm going to try plane shift because it fucking failed last time mine 21 i think it's wisdom do you have any preference on your demise no that's too nice my original plan was to teleport you to the middle of the water dimension just have you slowly drown sam and or my other idea was to send you to the maze of the abyss yeah we'll go to the water i feel so bad man that doesn't feel good it doesn't feel good to be a bully everyone let this be a lesson i still have movement yeah scanlan dropped his reverse gravity yeah scanlan's there do i have enough movement to move over there actually you know what no one's in the tower right you went over there oh shit goddamn it do i have my bonus action still i do right i'm going to use my bonus action to turn into an earth elemental oh fuck yeah it is let me go over there i can't reach i'm going to use my awesome mantle which allows me to jump what just my modifier my strength score is 14 so i have plus two to my strength let me jump behind there do i have enough with the rest of my movement can i get inside this building then i'll stay there take me out to the-- what's after that the crowd i have freedom of movement too cast on me that was so good thank god for that fucking 4th-level spell only when we reach level 20 boys only when we reach level 20 early game druids kind of suck later games kind of boss what do i have to save 22 let me do the math really quick yeah i'm all right i rolled a natural 16 i feel so bad i had to teleport grog away but i'm still looking for vax did you turn it in stay turnt yeah 28 what damage eight that's 36 total it's okay everyone hates me tonight so were all in the same boat huh l will look though i didn't have any concentration spells up either in case you come back let me actually check fuck i hope this doesn't fuck up peek around the corner do i see scanlan (laughs) sure i'm going to peek around see scanlan and be like hey buddy you see vax cool good to know feeblemind fail well you still have to roll for it feeblemind level eight range for feeblemind is 150 feet i should've backed up and what does he have to do yes you rolled a 19 fuck i should've fucking been out of range we're both really good i respect you so much but we're so good we're great and then i'm going to go to my earth elemental form i've still got shit to do i'm going to use my movement can i jump back over and run behind the tower this way 30 feet this way instead of curving around can i just go straight away from the blue thing just in case the blue thing hurts instead of curving can i just go further from the blue thing the blue the blue thing went so the circle is up next no if that's the case let me step back right there all right just straight intelligence do i get anything as the earth elemental i keep my mental stats though not that that means anything okay i'm trying to make sure that i don't have any type of weird resistance-- terrible he tried to do what he did to me okay i take how many 11 psychic damage so i'm at 115 i'm still going don't count me out yeah well i'm currently shifted casting a spell isn't considered a part of wild shape it's an inherent druid nature ability it's not a spell who me do i see vax at all probably not i'm going to use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental and swan dive into the water then i'm going to swim over to the edge of the pond where scanlan is 90 feet yep i'm going to come out of the water and i'm-- you fucking feebleminded i can still see motherfucker i still have eyes i'm going to come out of the water and i'm going to attempt to whelm him whelm make a strength saving throw failure it's an attack you take 2d8 bludgeoning damage 11 plus four so 15 damage you are grappled and unable to breathe do i still have movement that's okay i just want to take my grapple with him and my whelm and take him back under into this creek yes whelm it's my ability i'm basically a big elemental and you're stuck inside of me i mean you're stuck inside of me until further notice yes and i'm now under the water hiding with scanlan inside of my belly aw i knew he was going to do that the blue does that mean it skips it's my turn already okay okay i pop my head out of the water do i see anybody okay i'm going to switch to an earth elemental i'm going to come out of the water i'm going to walk over to the edge of the tower i'm going to be like fuck whoever's in this shit and go boom and start bringing this tower down with my siege monster do i have to roll to hit still first attack 14 okay that's 2d8 plus five i do that's 15 wait yes 15 damage doubled right so 30 and then second attack much better than that it was a natural 12 so plus eight so 20 fuck all y'all i'm stupid and angry oh boo that was so good did you not realize it's what fighters do i know exactly where you are that's a good call you disengaged kind of do i see percy oh wait i can feel him me are you thinking that's going to save you okay what do i want to do with you that is such a question what's next next is the fire right oh hang on can i make my way to them yeah here's the question since i know kind of where he is can i use my bonus action to turn into a fire elemental and go to him i'm going to do that my fire elemental movement is 50 feet uh-huh actually shit i didn't mean fire i meant water if that's doable it's fine i already called it no i already called it i have 50 feet yo so pouty first i'm going to enter your space immediately and you take 1d10 fire damage and you catch on fire seven damage two touch attacks i'm doing both attacks at once here first attack is 22 second attack doesn't hit either then but you're on fire do i have any more movement can i move through this crack on the other side here sorry boom mics wait when is it the top of the round did the torches go or no sorry i'm totally helping the dm ballsacks okay blue that's gone i know he's around here somewhere yeah over around this side can i jump into the water and swim around as a water elemental and see if i can get to this other side this might not be the best call if i get around here can i poke my head up and see if i find him i just projected where i was going to be though he could just change his fucking mind don't sext him while you're at it jesus well i was jumping into water elemental to go around but if i don't feel him land then i'll go earth elemental let me start stomping up and over and seeing what i see (grumbling) okay do i see anything do i see any flying asshole rogues it's a good mechanic brutal that's a good idea yeah i thought it was going to be me and grog again yeah if you had closed the gap that's it that's down for any of us nine so nine now and then another four so 13 as the internet said earlier we're really bad at shit-talking each other just embrace it kill him is that a crit damn it so close not that i'm cheering on for your death or anything i'm just excited i'm excitable oh scanlan we could have been pit fiends together but i got feebleminded oh no and you died we waited too long we were going to be awesome damage yes pretty much everything hits these motherfuckers all right let's dance i jump as i jump i'm going to turn into a water elemental ker-splash then use my movement speed to come up i'm going to try to whelm vax with my dope mantle i'm an archdruid beast shape says that anything that's on me absorbs into me and elemental is my form 20 strength how much speed do i have left so 45 can i get to vax i can swim i'm a fucking water elemental blub blub blub whelm again each creature in the elemental's space so yes then i'll do my two slam attacks bam bam 20 misses i've got to roll high in order to actually get you that's even better 25 roll baby 17 points of damage okay that's it not a bad call was so hoping i was going to have vax in that water it's just us kids wait is that magical no it's straight damage right what was the first one 56 that's not right either no that is right what was the other one yep i'm going for that motherfucker right there then let me go earth elemental and walk on over to him there we go total i can't get any further yes okay yeah there's nothing i can do as an earth elemental with feeblemind sure i'll get right up in his face i can't grapple him i can't do anything okay wait is it all the way up into here sorry i don't mean to retroact things if that's the case can i do an air elemental and fly over in that case let me do a fire elemental if that's okay and then i'll go 50 feet i've got 50 feet of movement and i can move through one-inch spaces can i get in his space and catch him on fire immediately are you still on fire should i have rolled again six points of damage i go hey scanlan i found him i found vax scanlan he's on fire i can still attack him no i just walked there what do i have to roll to hit him by the way he's down and unconscious so do i have to roll yeah both of my attacks hit i just sit on him i'm like sorry i hit him twice sorry boo hit i'm really easy to hit so 37 total what's the first one is it piercing which i take half of because it's not magical so 37 total okay i mean i can do that too just a straight con save don't fuck me gil that's good 20 total okay whose turn is it so wait what did the field just do did it do the torch or did the torch already happen cool cool cool cool i'm going to go earth elemental oh yeah i'm going to jump all over kool-aid man style do a big old fatty jump leap or if i can get to percy okay i can't jump over it am i within ten feet of him fuck okay that's it then can i move five feet to reach him he still has a decent amount of hit points though this is a force wall if i throw him into it it's going to suck okay can i grapple him and pummel the shit out of him i'm going to grapple with the first attack don't fuck me gil that's not bad 19 do one more attack on him do i get advantage on the grappling i just attack him not good sorry 12 saved with a natural 18 you are still higher 17 oh and he's stuck can i take and through this wall push it and start crushing percy two slam attacks with the wall crush crush against the wall or against percy first one is a 20 total no 21 total the second one is a 19 total does he take any from being sandwiched okay can i use my bonus action to go earth elemental again then i will stay what is best right now yeah can i do two slam attacks on him again bam bam multi-attack not good
