finally although you are taliesin jaffe only if the writers' room dropped the ball yep apple and google play oh yeah we have some announcements (perfect unison) shit's getting real (gasps) you can get them they're on thinkgeek i think what a douche scanlan you should remember that line that's a good one yeah yeah the prime trammel which we now have to get-- and the cliffkeep is not too far from whitestone do i recognize the city that i can get us to that's close my home sorry sorry terrah is the earth ashari should we go to terrah check in with them i guess while we're there and talk to pa'tice all right we ready to go i will burn my 8th-level spell slot to plane shift us to terrah mind the gap don't worry about it yeah i should probably-- we need to collect more though right we have to get like eight or something oh no wait ioun was healing for eight centuries that's where i got that number sorry oh yeah let's walk through that asshole that sounds worse for us but fuck it what were the shard things called again the things we need to collect so we need pieces of god oh to terrah do we want to stay the night here then i can't mist us right now i'm tapped out camp here yeah let's go they have a spare room for us i'm the leader of the air ashari and the voice of the tempest no there's four of us and i'm one of the four i do no we can just go like i was saying five minutes ago let's just go i request pa'tice kaitiaki pa'tice i am so sorry for the late intrusion we've just gotten back from the plane of elysium so we're a little tired yeah we're fighting a god right now well more of like a demi-god so have you heard of vecna sorry i'm probably getting ahead of myself do you have any food let's talk over dinner we always try to source locally so the world's in danger as she said-- aw shit i just induced panic (sighs) okay more than anything i think i would want you all to be relief for the surrounding area and surrounding villages if anything disastrous were to happen i know you have to guard the rift and that is insanely important and especially right now with someone like vecna who could potentially abuse that but if anything were to happen i don't know if you could house extra people during a disaster yeah that's more i think what we would need currently vecna is just north of vasselheim close to pyrah they've also been put on alert but we have not personally been there yet since this has happened yeah thank you do you know if people still try to live there we're looking for someone okay maybe i saw that (laughter) so the question is is there actually someone of some minor intelligence living there that is this magical key or did that person get eaten by a giant i'm not saying it's bad information i'm just wondering who the key is yeah maybe they're still living inside maybe it's like a moby dick situation can we theoretically just mist over everywhere it is a little weird to be making promises though keyleth opens the shamble door first with a little earth movement i'm dressed yeah i'm not like that i'm going to go get coffee i guess are we wind walking there (mispronouncing) wind walk wind walking yes no man we have been through this with our entire group so many times thank you what do you need we can leave it in the hands of the ashari see if they can find somebody yeah they're all right taliesin and towards the falafel pools we have it on the map i quickly do the math of how fast i can travel and be like okay it shouldn't take long this is a vacation spot what's that water park nearby i'll go i follow i think we've failed at manners often i'll be comfortably back as well yes that's exactly why bear traps are the biggest thing you can get for a giant trapped is this going to be an uncharted kind of adventure you did say kinky right what's your name friend that oddly made way too much sense i sometimes live in a yurt they're quite nice no i know what he means who were your companions oh no oh no grog what's your relationship to her good question you're a champion of ioun of course he's a champion of ioun what why do people like calling you elf boy and elf girl wait yes i'm a little freaked out right now you're my worst fear incarnate sorry that seemed very rude my worst nightmare incarnate i've seen you in my dreams somehow everything you have said since the minute we've walked into this building has made 100% sense and i think that's what scares me the most is i understand everything you've said we can grant you power in items but i don't want to speak for all of us but i think all of us can speak a little bit to the fact that items don't grant you as much inner power as you expect them to unless they're very highly argued and debated-upon boots in which case i still think the argument-- of course he believes believing is not the question that's something that's tangible ioun is distant what if we have found her what if sprigg is right what if all of the information that ioun knows is here in sprigg how we don't have the eye what a cock it's always been the troll dick do i have time for a reaction 24 (yelling) no sprigg don't fuck me gil it's fine gil did all right 12 i don't know why i did deuces 12 12 initiative wu tang out cowards yay manners we're bad at manners until now she's after me what where who there were more of them he's going for sprigg but because scanlan's over sprigg come on sprigg the pen is mightier than the bookcase security okay in my weird emotional panic keyleth is going to turn and look around and she sees vex firing a bow and sprigg down on the floor and she's upset and she's just going to scream at the top of her lungs and do a fire storm around the building just (screams) and then i'm going to go (boof) where i think people might be in my rage around the building sorry vax i don't really know you're there but around here and around here and i'm sure i see vex shooting at things right i'm going to try and go around here around and that way no he's getting hit i just know there were people shooting through this window and through this window so i'm doing a perimeter around ten ten-by-tens 21 i need two more d10s i reroll ones none of these are ones unfortunately (counting) 39 fire damage 39 and they're on fire so that was my action i'm going to do that out of my staff as i slam it down i'm going to look at sprigg and say gods damn it sprigg and i'm going to use that as my healing word and i'm going to cast healing word at second level which is 2d4 11 points to you and then i'm going to use my free action that i have to turn into a fire elemental changing into something's not a bonus it's a free action to change into my beast shape circle of the moon bitch no combat wild shape all right so i'm just keyleth wait hang on no i'm doing the perimeter i did think about this which is why i didn't attack the guy in the house right there keyleth has anger issues it's fine so i didn't destroy your house first the censer i do have the herbs thankskeyleth yeah i've earned it come on yeah that hits yeah you said 30 points right so i'm at 83 points there's room over here you get a grit point back right we're real sorry about your house nine ugh debris ugh (repeating) action action-- that's such a good spell (stuttering) oh jeez fire storm yeah no d10 i know that's my one goal in life i'm a big old homewrecker is it in a fireproof safe no okay all right so i have this big asshole in front of me yeah the house is catching on fire right yeah nope she'd still be really upset and really angry so continuing what i was saying before she's gonna rage a little bit more and go into her fire elemental self unable to contain her frustration-- even more upset i'm gonna move right in the space of this guy i mean i'm magical i sparkle fire i'm going to go into this guy's space engulf in flames and do my multi-attack two slam touch attacks that's cocked ooh that's good that's good 21 and 16 fucking balls okay no plus six to 11 that's 17 so both of those hit 2d6 plus three first one is eight plus ten 18 fire damage that's all i've got i think that's it what do you mean it's not a big deal that's the part that i'm confused about does that mean that keyleth would have seen the beholder beforehand you know what don't worry about it man so much blind rage keyleth takes a few steps back and motions as a fire elemental i drop my fire form turn see my anger destruction get immediately guilty and then do a tidal wave to quell the flames they have multiple eyes he had another eye right ah ow (laughter) keyleth is definitely staring but pretending not to stare what is it really it is him i've known it from the minute that i laid eyes upon him it's him no i mean i had a hunch i had a feeling deep down inside i can't say it if i say it out loud and then if it's not true then i'm an asshole percy continue holding his hands i pull out the tome of quick movement hold hold while i find the paper hold (shushes) where is it i have a lot of things i pull out the fork we that we got to get to elysium is it similar oh no no it is good it's good it's just oh sprigg no it's fine it's good i don't know everything in my life seems to have this impermanence factor about it so i hope he's not something that can be used and discarded sprigg i'm sure it's fine i just-- oh sprigg i guess i have to start getting used to losing things i've already built my own prison they don't know i'm already there and i grab his hand and with that i cast plane shift to wherever he is leading to go i immediately turn and look to see if sprigg is still holding my hand okay glad you're with us sprigg yes it is okay i will oh god they're souls distracted by percy keyleth just scans does anything in primordial stick out that's good 29 i hold my hand over and pull i put it back and get frustrated hey sprigg stand over there damn sprigg stand over there yeah keyleth was quietly sobbing in vax's arms and then heard (wedding march) and went (angry roar) worst double date sangria partners ever me and him we already know it's fine you fucking liars you fucking liars just tell us we know yeah (sarcastically) oh surprise yeah it's amazing and keyleth lights up her flame hands as she walks off in a fury no it only gets filed away in some library where no one else can experience it except for what one maybe two people ever
