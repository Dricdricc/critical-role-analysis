we confirmed how do you mean yeah how do you mean feeling the hut of wodenna right yes it was on garmelie's list of things to avoid i wonder if she knows the other hags that we've encountered well see you guys did kind of jump and it didn't feel good right so one i'm certain she is lonely and two she's probably the hag she's definitely probably the hag i feel like we're trying to talk ourselves out of this aren't we okay we'll not go towards the hut it's probably now okay that's true you were inside his gut you have to remember that all right new d20 that's a dick move that is a-- he got a 19 and i got a three it's a step in the right direction 20 yeah dispell magic poor reception okay can we see the hag moving inside the hut through the window oh my god 14 yeah she's inside northeast northwest northwest this direction this direction oh man that makes me want a scanlan backpack oh man i don't know that happened to be fair also everything in the feywild-- -- has been more sensitive defensive and more intelligent everybody freeze is it to the northwest ooh well okay is what we're trying to do figure out a way to not have to walk in the muck you're-- that's what i was gonna say i can always polymorph you for a moment grog you want to be a monkey yeah what kind of monkey okay and i turn grog into a gorilla which might be more intelligent than what he was before i think i do i do but i don't have it in my little book looks good on you grog ooh you'd be like a little silverback baby okay i know the twins are good on flying for the most part well but you can walk unhindered right you can walk fine can someone borrow your broom again (laughs) give it to your brother he's trustworthy right right right vax oh right that's true i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna use a beastshape and i'm gonna go into an eagle form i can carry scanlan to be fair i've been flying a lot longer than you have vax it's true ooh potion of climbing nice all right i fly over to scanlan (eagle sound) like scout i go ahead and i take off with scanlan and do kind of a high aerial loop around the tree just at the top really high really high getting nice-- watch do i have advantage because i'm an eagle don't eagles have advantage i do have advantage okay eagle eyes 27 like sap like even the top of the tree and stuff evil maple syrup yeah i know that's intimidating still on my back scanlan you wanna get closer and i'll do kind of a tighter loop around it see if i can get any more details i was doing a tighter loop of the tree see if i can get any more details that we haven't already seen okay i fly back to the others it's up to me i drop grog's polymorph and my eagle form after i've landed is this what we were talking about that time swamp shoes i can help you with those that mud looked at me the wrong way i can go sounds fun something that burrows i guess i technically could've taken a short rest correct in the time we're just chilling okay well i'll take a short rest i just want to take a short rest just-- yeah just enough time and then i'm gonna turn into an earth elemental and i'm gonna swan dive-- i thought we were in the mansion oh did i say something i don't know you've clearly been moisturizing yeah i do the same oh my god this is horrifying ten 10 percy catch me yeah can we have the mansion i mean we can still come in and out of the mansion i take my fire hands and i see if i can light the gunk on fire okay i start taking my short rest i dunno after is that enough time i druidcraft the shit out of those did you get that from a fortune cookie where'd you get that i really wanna swan dive into the muck if i tighten my abs and keep my feet together it shouldn't make much noise at all i have been watching a lot of olympics i swan-dive i take a minute to compose myself and then-- --as gracefully as possible pull like a pocahontas and then turn into the earth elemental as i dive in sail i start to earthglide breaststroking through the mud under the swamp to the tree i'm heading towards it how much further down is it okay then i go down i wanna use my tremor-sense too to just be aware okay if i reach and out touch one of the roots like just run my hand along it what happens i move back a little bit kind of getting away from the tree do i sense any type of creatures living under here any movement nothing crazy okay i'm gonna start making my way back to the mansion ooh like the swamp thing do i look like the swamp thing that's cool (rock noises) that's very poetic and then i kind of make my way up and drop earth elemental form yeah i think it's good i didn't really see much or learn much more than we already knew no creatures the muck did not try to eat me it's not as deep as i would've thought actually it's only three feet or so deep i do believe that the tree is living though i think its roots were kind of twitching and moving around it is a real tree the roots were very turgid someone taught that to me earlier i also walk in scanlan are you remodeling i kinda fwooshed it off i go downstairs to watch oh and i help him finish the shoes by helping druidcraft them i also go ahead and cure myself up eh wait do we have any vague plan wait we plan at dawn we'll plan at dawn they go straight down maybe something has trees on its back and moves i don't know maybe was it coming from that direction so the direction we came from no i don't think so i've been helping percy with his shoes just finished making shoes yeah they might work thank you thank you i'm proud of them percy you were supposed to be a bootmaker you're super-judgey how do you mean vanish like something really large passed in front of it that's different do i know of anything that would cause that can i roll a nature check or something don't fucking fail me (yells wordlessly) 14 that could be so many things it's hard to say it's producing a lot of it too way more than it should and a little bit of minerals and dirt well we're also in the feywild might not need the same thing well i mean nothing here has really been natural so you think maybe it's the tree that ate that other group of trees it's a cannibal tree it's eating its own kind does fenthras mean anything fenthras doesn't mean anything right is that a name protector and growth no it seems-- make some maple syrup i mean when i was in my earth elemental form i got up underneath the tree i mean i feel like if we needed to i can get inside of it yeah they're still sitting here today it's fine no if anything it's a terrible terrible influence well it's not short on water that's for sure i mean it was sludgy enough was there groundwater right when i communed with nature everything was alive everywhere that's what the rules here haven't really-- yeah i can i can i can do we have any questions that i might want to figure out before i-- cure the tree is the tree eating other things can we cure the tree is that even a tree i'll maybe try and figure out okay all right i'm gonna go step outside i have to be connected with the ground i think okay yeah tie a rope around me and i jump back in the mud i'm gonna kind of lay back into it sensory deprivation tank-style um okay can i figure out what is feeding the tree what the tree if the tree is consuming things around it what is fueling the tree i sense a lot coming out from the tree that's clear can i sense an energy going in towards the tree what is fueling the tree yes sondur what is the tree's weakness who is sondur that's actually i should've thought about that that's a good one okay then can i ask the living fauna around me if this tree is sucking life force from them is the tree in the middle hurting the plants all around like for example-- is that all i got is the cancerous tree more than just a tree sure that probably sure sondur sondur that's (laughs) flight of the sondurs is it an elven word percy you've done a lot of reading of the elven culture do you know anything about a sondur yes grog it didn't appear to be one thing because it was harming the plant life around it so it's not necessarily all connected it seems but it is also definitely not just a tree didn't you get a bunch of salt when you jumped into the-- --when you did the cannonball contest it was a bow that felled the titans i do it's just where how do i find it exactly when did we talk to her all right feywild hang on god i was clearly writing incredibly fast i have 'archfey black heart' he was an arch-- yes go ahead so we can assume that the archfey is probably sondur and he's probably still inside the tree and he probably is not gonna let go of his bow and then he must have fought in what was known as the calamity where does 'black heart' come from i wrote down 'black heart' seemed important 'cause he was corrupted okay so someone's going into the tree maybe i can i can attempt to talk to the tree huh (laughs) why are you acting this way please give us your bow yeah so wait are we here on a mission to cleanse the land is that what we're posing as we're like missionaries it would be a wonderful thing just chicken and waffles yes kind of like snowshoes but with more surface area basically wood paddles on our feet yeah but you have that i won't take that are we still doing our-- we'd have to make that decision now while i'm learning my spells at the top of the day that is true that is an old druidish proverb yep i'm kinda wondering if the tree has a tremor-sense wait is it the same maybe it is something big blocking it with like an invisible field i don't know i don't know we tried what are you drawing oh yeah how is my tree scanlan are we trying to talk to it first and i make myself to look like the tree-dick on my forehead i cast speak with plants are you waiting for me sondur can you hear me i am keyleth from the air ashari druids of the prime realm are you still present we would like to see your heart me and my fellow companions are coming in i go in first just army crawl me bringing up the rear this time grog watch the-- wait wait wait we're not alone he's watching us sondur is this you leading us straight to you i look at scanlan and wipe the tree-dick off my forehead i stand as well he's a dick oh shit oh fuck no he was a fucking cock no dude like you said i don't trust anyone who says we're alike you and i i also don't like anyone who tries to act like we didn't make our own choice to come in here that we're totally different yeah 15 oh bow's on the ground bow's on the ground what does that mean where's that dice yeah right not bad 20 total 20 total damn that's half oh that got so awkwardly quiet it just sounds weird inside the tree acoustics preferably in rose gold (the music comes back in less distorted) yes much better much better you're good it appeared he took damage from the necrotic so he can take necrotic damage good to know on the necrotic damage hell yeah hell yeah scanlan hell yeah (all laugh) whoa yeah that makes sense it's what i would do i was thinking fire too fuck yeah (laughing) yeah you're not grappled yeah rejection he's been alone for too long no you're not ooh fuck i'm gonna go for the ents all right so you go first then fire fuck yeah pew-pew the ceo of this tree that was really good that's pretty good okay so these trees that are moving appear to be living trees more or less correct i'm gonna cast tree stride on myself and then i'm gonna go into fire elemental form and flame on no and i don't know if it's really gonna work oh i've been a fire elemental before yeah well i'm casting tree stride right i'm casting tree stride because it's a concentration that lasts a minute and then i'm going to use my bonus action to flame on if this works all the rage of the fire ashari and then i'm going to enter inside that treant right in front of me i'm going to very nicely enter it with its permission and consent and then i'm going to multi-attack well ideally because as per the rules of tree stride i may use i instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind and as part of my movement i can pass into any other trees of my choice of that same kind so i'm gonna take this guy on for right now we'll see those are pretty good the first hit sorry i don't know my i'm trying to find what i add here okay so the first one is going to be 25 to hit and the second one's going to be 16 fuck yeah flame hands which is an additional d6 correct so i am rolling 2d6 plus three twice so i'll do 4d or i'll roll 3d6 twice first one not bad eight plus five is 13 plus another three so 16 16 for the first one the next one is 14 and until the creature takes an action to douse the fire the target takes-- oh it also anything that if i move within it immediately takes 1d10 damage whenever i move into its space nine that i am satisfied with yes yes it is now a safety hazard careful for falling limbs sondur what up i think this is caramel nope fudge i got the fudge end including me inside the treant 16 am i immune to that as a fire elemental just resistant to it i take half damage how much did you say it was 24 i'm immune to prone other way i think i give off a soft glow that's always a bummer man that sucks immune to grapple calling in the cavalry it does unless he douses himself he takes another 1d10 six you're still-- where is he where are you scanlan i might be able to try and do something if i can go first maybe i can burn you away fucking dick oh man okay i am going to march over to that oh man to that guy number two treant number two i want to see if i can tree stride through him-- i did even though i have resistance on bludgeoning damage and all that shit oh my constitution modifier as a-- just my modifier eight fuck well i still whelm him that guy in front of me i still can move into his space that's my fucking opal dice again asshole oh look and that was 18 two slam attacks do i roll with advantage no no i'm rolling my three dice oh wait no i don't think i did i forgot that part oh man two 11s which 17 to hit both times okay so the first one um 15 for the first one and another 15 for the second one he's on fire oh and he takes another d10 because i moved into his space so another four points from me yeah that sounded like a lot of dice you all right still up two can play at that game motherfucker c'mon c'mon aw pythagoras's theorem man c'mon that's right at 60 right a-squared plus b-squared equals c-squared c'mon still up no it's when i'm-- five feet maybe wait i think it's when i'm sharing space is he dead he's dead let's make s'mores after this wisdom 18 plus 11 so 29 oh my god i mean he's gotta be pretty angry i'd be angry exactly where grog was that's cool she's down what what fucker's having a good round i don't know if i can be grappled we can dimension door though i can try and take you-- i can try coming to get you undone no i mean i mean burn you from the vines like get you ungrappled i don't know if so question could bigby's hand toss a fire elemental's ass so it's like a magical hand meets magical fire elemental could kinda work all right here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go over to scanlan and i'm gonna burn the vines around him that are holding him in that's my action i go okay and i hold my action until i wait for scanlan i wait for scanlan to-- to throw me it was girl power that healed you i'm feeling it yeah spice magic this is my jam i turn into a fireball myself very gently god damn it five points halved or was that-- did i can i-- i can't do that i gotta be there do i still have any movement 50 can i start climbing 25 feet up the wall okay not good five okay well then i'm gonna take the rest of my action i'm just going to angrily slam into the tree and see if i can catch the tree up under him on fire that would've been so cool had it worked i know you're down again aren't you blight's nasty the breeze from his wings kinda stokes my fire elemental form a little bit and i'm kind of into it this guy had a rough breakup or something man come on percy (laughing) don't care do you crit on a 19 fuck that's a good roll though that's a good roll dead-ent dead-ent dead-ent dead-ent-- yeah grog yes you basically killed him with bro-shame and i go for it too heeheehee i drop my fire elemental form you know from him i think that was a compliment yeah i go up to vex and i just grab her arm and i say don't let any man-- or anyone for that matter-- make you feel like you need them to be great because you don't i'm not good with words but he was an asshole and i don't want you ever dating an asshole he wasn't good enough he was mean (in an exaggeratedly evil voice) you drug your friends to their doom we keep making a show i drop to my knees and do a commune with nature do i gather a different energy from the surrounding plants do i still sense the presence of sondur do last question does the tree seem happier what is the tree gonna do from here on out what are you gonna do tree exist cool everything seems great this big one yeah you know the tree just told me that it actually feels much better so trees that won't take it personal do you want to hit something here i'm-- you guys ready to go home i think i've seen enough of the feywild for now no no no that can't be good garmelie and i cast hold person at the same time 19 for mine as well what are those words you know for someone who hates the theater you've made quite a show of all this (all laugh) wodenna did you know sorudin sorudin the happy i have a feeling we'll meet you again artagan everyone hold hands and say kumbaya we've dealt with enough scorned lovers for one day i guess whitestone i take his hand i say you haven't been quite bad yourself and then we go to whitestone you got your bow man that guy tried to act like he knew you fuck that shit oh dude that's cool she's like hanzo out of their corpse yeah can we talk about that dog can we talk about it back in whitestone
