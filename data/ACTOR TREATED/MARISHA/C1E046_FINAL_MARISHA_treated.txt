let's go avoid the skeletons what did you not just hear my father-- do you have pass without a trace vex we also don't want to waste all of our abilities on undead why don't we just tread that way and we'll see what happens did we already have it triple advantage 28 i'm afraid if we engage it could draw attention to an entire slew of what could be around all right jesus christ vex you might be the most capable of this daggers who exactly is the patronage of your candle business who do you sell to i'm so sorry things do tend to die around us a lot you might get something even bigger oh like candles for funerals that's sad we do have a lot of tragedy we're trying to close this giant rift that we're walking into were they sisters if you make magical candles you must know a little bit of magic correct okay i don't know i don't know if stealth is going to be a thing going forward it's a fire elemental would he be considered a primordial okay i'm going to go fire elemental seeing it i'm going to transform and go into my fire elemental is this the first time i've been fire elemental yeah learned from cerkonos yeah in fire elemental just like-- that's what i'm going to go do so i approach and i'm going to do the animal instinct thing and poof up and make myself a little big oh it's running from me deuces and i roll back are we-- wait are we in the fire plane yet oh we're in the caldera okay i'm going to say halt in ignan which i'm assuming it speaks i follow after it and i say in the name of the guardians of this realm you will stop at which point i'm going to do a fire intimidation tactic i'm going to do a fire radial thing and i'm going to say as the leader of this realm as the kaitaki of the fire nation you will heed my word no that one fails me a lot it does shut up travis natural 20 it doesn't matter who i serve for i am above him i am your master now this is not your realm get back into the fire plane where you came from holy shit i fly back over to them still in fire elemental form-- and i'm like you guys did you see that it was really crazy did you see did you see they think i'm their leader they think i'm their god i chill out i chill out i can't revert back though guys because i want to stay in this i give them a fire thumbs-up yeah i'm going to take off leading in my fire elemental form deeper towards the rift keeping my eye out for any elementals that might be escaping i'll throw up a skywrite or actually as a fire elemental can i just be like (fire flares) in fire elemental form can i send up a little bit like a flare fuck i don't realize she's doing it hold for a second and wait for team three's response right there's a third team three teams right oh one two we were three okay yeah i feel like helen hunt in that moment in twister so these are all fire elementals should i continue-- huh four you brought him into this world 16k and a sloth oh shit that was awesome okay work with me here so here's what i want to do i want to go low and dive into that lava pit in front of me and i want to-- using the lava around me to rise out of the lava and look really scary and badass and then i'm going to shout to the living elementals i'm going to be like hear my warning i am your new master retreat to the fire plane or meet your imminent demise this is your last chance thanks thanks guys and if you'd like to meet for coffee later i might be available okay okay that's better than my persuasion let's do this one that one rolled a one get out of here get out of here 15 away that's cool okay but that one's peacing out do i still have an action i knocked one off the plank did i put fire resist on you at the end of last game so you take half damage nice i rush that way and look for my other tribe can i see any of my other tribemates that's better that one keeps fucking me what'd you say perception 26 no sorry sorry 24 cow-tipper this is coming out of the rift oh and so this is a pool of lava that they're coming out of molten fire plane more or less i'm going to and upon seeing this drop my fire elemental form and i say oh shit i have a feeling this is the 'him' they were talking about and i have a feeling he's not going to believe that i'm the real new master so there's that 24 can keyleth do a quick ancillary action before shit happens jesus sucking it up today i'm seven by the way i know i'll just be back here caboose yeah nope not leading shitty initiative roll there was planning there was a thought process (laughs) yeah oh wait why did it go back it's just fire what is that is that guy and that guy within 30 feet of each other it's hard to tell with the thing on it a 30 foot long spell could hit both of them correct okay but this guy-- oh damn it what about this guy and this guy they're within 30 feet right actually yeah let me do that i am going to cast a tidal wave right here and i'm going to go outward in this direction and it's ten foot wide and 30 foot long so let me back up a little bit out of it yeah yes since it's water do they have disadvantage do they take more damage because it's water it does 4d8 damage ooh that's good 12 plus eight is 20 plus another eight is 28 math it's 30 foot tall and 30 feet long why didn't we switch to metric okay i will oh i'll scootch up a bit start moving towards that's good that works oh my god can we do that like a hamster ball he tripped at the finish line here's a laser pointer if you need it oh that was almost bad you do it's hot it's really hot just keep going maybe the heat made you misfire so we have these two assholes in front of us well depends on the day so that guy is still alive too yeah i'm going to tidal wave again tidal wave right here this way fucking with these two guys it's really good i'm warning you right now seven and seven is 14 plus another six brings me to 20 plus eight 28 again that's what i had last time right 28 and then technically in tidal wave it says the water then spreads out across the ground in all directions extinguishing unprotected flames in the area within 30 feet of it can i use my bonus action-- question can i theoretically cast a grasping vine coming out of the hellmouth fuck never mind actually no that's not true i will take my bonus healing word to toss another healing word just 1st-level over to gern so you heal eight points gern can i-- no go you first please gern yeah it's a concentration spell no that's an attack i can try can i do a grasping vine from the bottom underneath of him and see if i can let me see how this goes first that's as far as it goes can i do the vines from out of the portal halved can keyleth run up do i have an action great yes pew pew matching piercings keyleth throws up a skywrite spell and says we're taking the portal yes i stand next to my father and join the rest of the druids am i a part of the people who could be included in the ritual too okay i am going to cast a 7th-level plane shift to help smush it closed 12 oh with advantage 23 do you have your dimension door a door i did planar binding which technically really wasn't supposed to do what i just did-- planar shift i mean yes 7th-level we don't still have our fancy feast do we you have advantage on wisdom throws i take a grasping vine from the edge and try and yank him back i moved up i moved up i would be over there yeah no i already knew that it's fine
