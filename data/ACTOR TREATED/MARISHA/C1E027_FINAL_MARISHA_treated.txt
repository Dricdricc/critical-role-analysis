i bet if you go back and look at the q and a session we had someone asked our dream game crew-- i made this just for you happy birthday orion's mom momlan as orion says release the critters no we have him it's balance (ricochet sound) how far can i get nothing's in visual sight can i dash and then make a bonus action i'll just wait let me just scootch over so i can be behind vex well to be fair we talked we didn't have a battle no that's a d10 these are d8s you do dope we need him alive come on trinket okay i'm going to-- seeing the direction that everyone's pointing going to walk up and reach around vex and i'm going to cast faerie fire right-- oh god wrong direction right in the fucking eye (laughter) crit fail it's a 20-foot cube so i want to cast it right in the cell against my spell's dc 18 you have advantage now and i'm going to take my bonus action to do healing word on the-- it's not jarett that's unconscious it's the cab driver on the cab driver six plus my spell modifier so ten is that right is that how it works plus my spell level is that what it is with healing word 1d4 plus my spellcasting ability modifier six so 12 can we do a check 22 i mean i can still go ahead and do the planar bindings to an elemental that maybe i should've done beforehand it lasts 30 days it's fine you'll have him in between you and him what time is it it's fine nope 17 i told you it worked sorry i'm a little defensive right now continue we were afraid of that so why didn't you want to show that you were also cleansed what was the point of holding up the charade so are we in agreement that we have to clear uriel's mind first is percy here is percy in the room i go get percy oh i come around the corner and i see percy hey i was looking for you you want to come and actually join the conversation for once instead of sitting outside the door and just listening to them because i really feel like this is going to be your time to input and maybe really help okay percy and i walk in wait what's the name of the town not whitestone oh i thought he was saying he was going to go to their hometown he's not going to whitestone he's going to go to wildemount which is on another continent if we go to another continent it doesn't matter if we're fleeing or not it's going to look like fleeing do you genuinely think they're going to let us go with permission we're not on their good side you know them better than anyone can i do an insight check on him see if he knows more than what he's saying 19 is that a nine i agree while we're not serving uriel that's not our purpose i also don't want to leave an enemy of the state that's not good for me for what i want and what go with jarett not jarett asum then why don't we save his mind before we go you've got to give context to those things man i go up to his arm and i druidcraft a wooden armband make it look cool and put that on him no onto asum now i can scry through that that way i can at least check in on you every once in a while if you're okay with that 21 he did say it was an inspired idea his words don't worry i won't abuse it i promise could you potentially help us with sneaking in the castle what if we talk to allura percy is being very quiet about this can i see if he looks like shaken or fucked up at all wait we're leaving to whitestone travis and what time is it what we were talking about can i help him with that can i assist him go percy go that's pretty good you still have inspiration from scanlan we were talking about making it collapsible i'll pitch in for that how much do you have you have less than 100 gold i'll pay for it in full why it's fine this is what we were talking about the whole thing's wasted can we try and repair the crack and how many more days how many more days do we have there's nothing i can do to help him my intellect i've got plus three percy roll come on maybe a version of it that is not collapsible that we can at least mount i thought we got a bit of an allowance it's how much yeah you have to have magic chainmail dickies sherri the whole time no you said i couldn't assist him i had no intelligence to assist him that's what i was saying i don't know if you can do holy water i can do a fog spell like the best i could possibly do is maybe take one of these holy water things oh wait i don't do that orionacaba i need to do shit too i can't be everyone's bitch i got to gilmore's and i buy an alchemy set this is made of things and then i go home and i make a few cure wounds potions try it out since i've learned and i've been studying and i've been doing my research so maybe a few level two level three cure wounds potions wait they cost 500 to 600 and they cost 400 for me to make them oh okay cheaper over time as i get better at it that's funsies well let me make-- what is that a greater healing potion let me make one for right now that's an 18 that's pretty good awesome i had a percy-roll and he hates me for it how long will it take me to make a daylight scroll third then i make two greater healing potions actually no i want to experiment i want to take one of those holy water bottles and i want to see if i can enchant it with my fog spell to make it a holy water fog grenade when you throw it it'll go (shatters) with my fog spell what if i enchant it with daylight oh wait it still won't-- i'm going to do it anyway i'm going to do the fog thing because i said it i'm going to commit no for the fog holy water thing it's a holy smoke grenade sure that'll be my two things i do natural 20 who would like a very unstable item i give it to scanlan please be careful wait i tell him scanlan this is very delicate please be very gentle with this that i trust i trust that more fine good advantage dope grog do you think i should do the whole elemental guardian thing all right give me that ruby (ting) i catch it water elemental seems appropriate based on our knowledge yeah water elemental and planar binding and i talk to him in my elemental speech which i can do and i say look we're going to be gone for 30 days we have a visitor here make sure nothing or no one brings him any harm (laughter) wait what i'm sorry for my time here i serve are we riding there by horseback is that what we're doing well we had one at our disposal when we were friends of the city yeah let's not tell anybody that we're leaving do we need a carriage we have a stable full of horses so that would shave time let's head there and make camp and maybe talk about a plan do it how far across is the bridge a hundred feet are we going by foot now here's my question what looks shaky the connection of the bridge or the actual physical condition of the bridge itself for bonus added safety in case this bridge gives way i'm going to cast grasping vine and have it loop and wrap around the edge of the bridge further enforce it at least that side will be fine and then i'll go across concentration spells who's left so what's our plan what are we doing 19 are they flying off a cliff i grasping vine him before he goes out of view off the side of the cliff what 19 25 does it sounds like anything nature-based something i could possibly have talked to in the past 25 oh fucking harpies taliesin and (shushes) everyone be quiet matt how long is the concentration on pass without a trace how long can you hold that concentration where are we against the mountain are we still on the mountain edge so we have a mountain behind our backs i turn around and i cast move earth my 6th-level fucker and i (boof) and i clear out a cave horses saved our lives guys i go ahead and druidcraft a little campfire tiberius you want to light a fire for us me and tiberius made a fire i also stay up with percy i talk to percy for a second percy while we're alone for a moment there's something that's been bothering me and i can't get it out of my head i thought i'd talk to you about it because i feel-- we're friends right we're friends are we friends been through a lot been together a while two years now you know you're a very brilliant person i can't help but feel like i'm being watched right now never mind forget i said anything i can't help but feel like there's something else there's something more to this that you're not telling us and i didn't really think of anything until we were having that fight where tiberius brutally murdered that old woman yeah me too but the one thing that i can't get out of my head was something that you said during that fight and for a long time i was like damn percy's got really cool one-liners and he's so smart and i wish i could have cool one-liners you and grog have really cool one-liners and then you said your soul is now forfeit to the person you shot that night and i thought wow that was an interesting one-liner yeah yeah you did for some reason i was the only one who noticed it and i don't know if that's because i'm just reading into things if that was just a really awesome but scary and brutal thing to say in the moment or if there's something deeper that you might be serving what thing wait what are you saying you had knowledge you didn't build that without inspiration what do you mean can i see if he's lying to me 17 yeah i'm wise as fuck what what did you say i still really feel like we're being watched do you feel that i don't know it's really distracting yeah well i love you we're in this with you until this end let's sleep we overslept okay so wait percy how much further out are we from whitestone 32 ah that's all right 14 let me think about it for a second do i know a creature that's blue and snakey i don't know ooh that's 24 the blue thing's weird the blue thing is what's throwing me but it didn't seem to give a shit i can i can cast anti-life shell on us then we can haul ass really fast yeah as long as you stay close to me it moves with me okay i cast anti-life shell stay close
