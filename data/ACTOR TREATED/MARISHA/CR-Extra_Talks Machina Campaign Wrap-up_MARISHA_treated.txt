it's festive we were such assholes yeah that was a good moment man would we have just died or would it have been a whole totally other campaign that was our little polymorph trick right we polymorphed the giant and then dropped it that was fun plus we had that flying carpet which i know you just hated interesting aw felt bad for little derpy keyleth felt a little bad just a little what was the turning point i don't think i've ever asked you this question what was the turning point when you were like oh maybe vax has a crush-y like every other adolescent male you stopped being an asshole and then realized-- okay my insights well that was right after i killed the kid yeah the first one because that was also one of the first big character-type changing moments that happened in our pre-stream game i remember talking to you about it and you were like you should probably think about how this is going to affect keyleth you snapped a kid's neck and i was like aw shit now i've got to own this and so she basically was really depressed after that and had lost herself and had continued on into her aramente where she went to the earth kingdom and was having a hard time basically functioning or fighting or doing any type of magic or nature-shifting so the vision ended up being my way of writing in her own epiphany and it was more or less to represent the consequences of inaction in that vision i considered her to see her death at the time it was so early that it was supposed to be a-- not meaning to be something to ever come to fruition ever but yeah it was supposed to be her lesson to herself that you figure it out or die and we changed our name yeah it ended up being more of an rp thing from taliesin and keyleth-- or keyleth and percy's perspective because we both were the ones from royalty i had a goal clar-ah-ta wait daryl and hannah i didn't know that she fell in love before and then went on the boat plus you know kash kind of beat you to the punch a little bit but i think it was before you had a last name right that was most definitely a thing in our game that definitely was a thing (laughter) yeah we've dealt with a few people from it yes no not at all she had a circlet in our home game she had a circlet that i kind of looped into-- was one of the last relics from her mom and her ashari tribe that she took with us-- or with her you get what i'm saying and then kit was the one who drew it as the antlers i told kit i was like she's got a dope circlet and that was about all i told kit and then it came back with antlers and i was like oh i love this whoops yeah just need a metal detector beep beep the fact that they counted them how he eventually critted on a 19 you guys are rolling a lot more too because you have three attacks right or do you have two attacks wait did he use friends he would have done that himself way sooner and you were going for the trifecta yeah you were going for it would there have been any other way to break him from that was it like a ooh he's broken i can fix him amazing that is such an extreme way of putting exactly what they were doing it's very accurate she was i had a weird crisis with keyleth for a little bit for a while i was like i can't stay what i am i doing here your friends will be the first people to drag you down they're bad influences and also at that time i think it was about that time i kept repeating i have to continue my aramente i feel like i'm just dicking around at this point i still have work to do i got to go you were also going through a character-- there were a few character crises yeah me too i mean keyleth was pretty boss there at the end i almost left respect the antlers (laughing) practically goldfish i thought that was the handle at first how did we end up getting out of that was it one of those cases where you saw one of the guards wearing the belt and you were like dude for real oh no probably not 100 percent no no she was still suffering from crippling self-loathing yeah just no she still didn't believe in herself and still was dealing with insecurity issues it took her awhile i think keyleth still didn't fully believe it until she was getting that mantle put on her over in the final ceremony i remember one of the bigger turning points of stepping up and making sure she was a leader was the kraken fight i put a lot of responsibility on keyleth and conversely myself for not stepping up and forcing a better plan on us it was my task that almost got everybody killed we almost tpk'ed that one and we could have done that way better and i think that was when she was like oh once again those moral lessons of inaction someone's got to fucking herd cats i forgot about that that was probably the exact turning point that moment i have a question had i not rolled a natural 20 when i stuck my hand into the ziggurat anything under the natural 20 what would have happened to keyleth laura and no not at all no one even knew i was down there everyone was asleep and i didn't even tell anybody you would have woken up and keyleth would have been gone how crazy would it have been it if i would have come back like robin williams in jumanji and come back 20 years later and i'm like the shit i've seen would you have ever gone with him would you have ever left with your bro i like chest piece of gloriousness hey ashley can i ask you a question what does the banner behind you say because it looks like it says boobs are magic how much is scanlan repurposing that for his vows he did that more than you raged sorry earth elemental you can certainly try male sure that's why i kept screaming don't kill the fucking kraken grog go find another kraken giant squid go find a second one she would've been the only one right i remember deep into that conversation i remember all of us reaching this point of we're talking in circles you're going to leave it's not meant to be redone at all you have the choice to tap out once again keyleth got close several times to being like fuck this we're bosses by that point what kind of a counterfeiter like a money counterfeiter that's right i do recall that yeah yeah that's crazy yeah sure yeah we'll call that suggestive was it really exactly like getting taft hartley-ed is what you're saying i don't think you gave him any bullets so we're back to the wedding it all hit at a really inopportune time if anything it's kind of what you said about you guys not wanting to be like your brother and keyleth i mean it kind of paid off in the end it ultimately is a good lesson fuck it don't wait if you love somebody don't wait go marry them tell them you never know what could happen let them know yeah don't be like creepy about it you know i thought about it but nah we worked really hard for that it's mine it would be better used in my hands ruling my people than in a museum somewhere i know anyway i did think about after the arc had ended and we were talking about what we were going to if i was going to go back to melora's temple and give the staff back then i was like nah i just like it too much really pulls the whole voice of the tempest thing together it's kind of crazy because at that point in time it seemed like all of the ghost stories that we had been dealing with were real and then hers-- yours wasn't my most cast spell call lightning that would have tapped us out by the time we would have gotten there and thank god he did yeah i think it still would have been a learning process getting into it but i think she had made peace that she was ready to do that and retire from adventuring because she was pretty exhausted by the end of that she was pretty done ready to move onto the next chapter in her life especially when they keep growing like jeez i will say when we cosplayed and did our opening title sequence and i was wearing those things there's no practicality in that shit it was awful they were always in the fucking way we all suffer as one impractical antlers yeah i stabbed everyone that day oh god wait which side did we go up yeah which one of the-- the other one would have been the relics okay i think she would've hesitantly tried yeah i don't know if she would've gotten the results that would've wanted which is why she would even be so tentative to doing it in the first place almost better to keep the illusion it for sure is vax than the confirmation that it might not be at all totally i was like oh fuck you bird yeah i think she might eventually but i don't think she would right away feed me aww get it getting all the vox machina ladies all three of us yeah cherry blossoms in the tree in the voice of the tempest ceremony god so many the hanging tree that one stuck with me they feel like real memories remember the cannonball competition in the pool that was great
