yes hello i am marisha ray and i am keyleth of the air ashari tribe and i am the circle of the moon druid level nine (laughs) i'm a dad i love those i also bend down and slap him a few times (all laugh) ohh i think i might-- anything we should know i-- i think i have a spell that might be able to help i don't know it right now though we'd have to take a break i'd have to pull out my books and relearn it it takes some time need to sleep on it oh my gosh thanks guys and donuts brain twerk a little warning next time it's like a three stooges act oh wait ask her if she's seen nostoc or if they've seen-- or yeah if they've seen our paladin friend our little-- lady kima we're going to kill your god wait fuck it just go with it (all laugh) yes do we have any idea what time it is all right i want to check out-- i'm gonna take the first watch-- i still have a lot of reading to do and i can go ahead-- i'm gonna go ahead and cast-- make sure everybody's in everybody's in anti-life shell a shell that keeps in anything from coming in (laughs) he'll try anything (laughs) oh scanlan (laughs) it goes pew pew it's a pew pew stick cool make sure everyone's in and close by and get done with everything i'm gonna take you guys-- i'm gonna cast anti-life shell that way everyone at least gets one good hour of sleep ugh wish pike were here eight so pretty i go ahead and i take a piece of paper from my spellbook and i take a piece of charcoal and i just scroll over top of it to get an imprint of it i take a few pieces of paper and i kind of glue them together- (all laugh) -- and then i get a really big one and then i roll it up and i have my anti-life shell up who is taking the next watch just the party is taking turns being like so pretty it's above our-- how's it going over there grog it's good religion religion oh no okay but let's-- am i awake are we awake did you wake me up why water why would you do that why couldn't you just touch me ugh stop i'm okay okay do we wanna stay here do we wanna do this here tiberius-- i don't know but i want us to be as safe as we can tiberius can you lift us up on your pillars or like encase us in or something make us a room make us a room yes okay we're gonna do this yes if you could scanlan give me some nice meditation some-- some like pure moods yes yes i go ahead-- i go ahead and light some incense scanlan scanlan do you still have that deity that little idol of pike can we just have that out just so i have her energy just feel like i need her okay let's not go there no need to be naked i'm so nervous i'm literally shaking okay i just kind of lay my hands on his forehead do i get an inspiration die from him or anything okay what am i rolling what do i do gah nauseous no where's the inspiration die where's the inspiration die it's a d8 right do i get advantage on this since i'm taking time i do have advantage on this oh that's much better i'm still gonna do the inspiration dice just in casies okay that's good okay so 17 plus 12 plus six plus six with my wisdom modifier my heart is pounding so that's 30 no 29 ah i'm still shaking grog grog ow just glad you're all right grog really glad you're awake to grog at like the gym and you need some alcohol after that good he's back you guys he's back good oh thank you i had pike in mind i channeled her energy yeah well that's a bit of a side effect that's part of the greater restoration a few things get restored woohoo i'm going to let the twins stealth ahead so we can only assume that what was his name yeah much worse well we also have this k'varn who is experimenting on all those creatures so we can't even attest for any of this yeah parts of one it could be a hodge-podge of everything so she's been here that's for your wisdom intelligence it would be enhance ability essentially i'll tell you i think it's wisdom no no no it's intelligence because i think it's like owl's wisdom for wisdom yeah you have advantage on intelligence checks so it wouldn't necessarily-- it wouldn't make your intelligence higher and it wouldn't necessarily help with your vulnerability well it's about like having high-- it's not necessarily being smart it's about having resistance to willpower right well we sort of know what we're going into hang on okay so here's my question so we've already fought two things where we can't look at them and they mess with our heads so is there something we can do going forward-- or like-- i like magneto's helmet or even if we-- do we have a bunch of mirrors or where we can look through things with reflections kind of like a medusa's gaze thing you know where you like look in the reflection right yeah it would just be about making us less vulnerable to the mind-- that's true i mean i can cast enhance ability to help our willpower or our will hey dungeon master asking as the dungeon master if i cast owl's wisdom on people it gives people advantage on wisdom checks would that count on saving throws against willpower would it help anything would would any advantage to wisdom under enhance ability help some right and for the brains it was versus willpower yeah and don't forget about our charity 826la which helps children be literate and write stories well what i don't know if i have anything let's get it done 15 do i see any-- are there any bats i failed i was gonna see if they're in the-- were you guys trying to stealth is that what happened (whispers) hey hey what do you guys see you're cutting out i can't hear you okay it's a racial bonus okay holy shit what are we going to do i give scanlan some water from my water skin i've heard rumors of those can we make a check for those did you see lady kima can i meditate to see if i know anything about this-- yeah what the hell thanks chat room an illithid illithid with a d or a t but i've never heard them called a mind flayer but i guess they could be called a mind flayer but we call them illithids i didn't know they were real though but scanlan didn't you also say that they were like levitating can we have tiberius standing there to just firebolt it i think i've heard that one that puppet show flying from the-- okay okay hang on hang on so let's have a failsafe in case a few get across the bridge illithid we really just need someone to keep them from running through that tunnel we need some way to keep them from coming-- going-- oh oh oh wait wait i actually have a spell while i was reading through my book last night catching up on spells that i kinda forgot about i learned something called hallucinatory terrain where i can make the entire terrain look like whatever i want other terrain what i can do is-- i can make the chasm look like it's solid ground-- i can make the tunnel across the way look like it's caved in are you good with hauling ass okay as long as you can haul ass before liam-- before vax leaves-- go ahead before vax leaves i just put my hands on his shoulders and i cast enhance ability on him and give you a dexterity boost so you have advantage on all dex rolls you have the advantage-- -- on all dex rolls if that comes to that ability checks i hope this works i'm gonna be-- can i be like halfway in between on the bridge is that a bad idea i can turn into a bird my-- which one it's a concentration thing so as long as i can keep it up oh yeah for up to 30-- 24 hours actually it's not a concentration spell 300 feet 150 square feet and it looks sounds-- -- smells like some other sort of natural terrain so what i'm doing whenever we-- can i make it look like there's a cave-in happening through the tunnel well that's what i'm gonna do yeah what i'm gonna do i just want the terrain to look on my side-- i want the terrain to look exactly like what it is but i just wanna stretch it out a little bit so it looks like they've got like an extra running space yes of actual yes like the bridge is an extra 40 feet away okay then i'll do that then i'm gonna just-- you know what i'm gonna stay on the opposite side of the bridge and i'm gonna focus on making that illusion yep thank you yes be careful guys please be careful mm-hm all right i'm on the outside of the bridge i'm out with them gone yeah are you convincing yourself or are you-- yeah i'm with you guys we're fine that's perfect come here bitches just watch your step yeah isn't he on the fake ground the lich (groans) oh no are you on the carpet vax son of a bitch use them dex saves you've got advantage holy shit he's like catatonic come on tiberius bye carpet i loved that carpet damn it it's just a carnival game for percy at this point so how many (monster sounds) are over there  and how many duergar left how many-- after they fell into-- come on percy like fish in a barrel okay oh go carpet ah fly me down with you tiberius and i are going to fly down on the carpet yes that's true i don't wanna fight i don't wanna fight that guy i don't know okay take me down-- hang on let me let's go see let's go see i've-- to ride the carpet down to the bottom with percy and tiberius right me and percy are on the carpet do i see any tunnels or areas that look like it leads someplace of interest i keep going are you done okay i say tiberius give me some light and i take-- and i cast control water and i just take the pool-- the water in the bottom of the pool and i bend it and i part the pool and i take it and i cascade it all the way up following the lava flows i can part seas with this oh okay okay well i'm taking-- okay i don't necessarily part it but i take the water and i draw it up cascading along the edges following all the lava streams going into the tunnels i'm gonna kind of push it you said there was a tunnel kind of going up into cthulhu side there's a waterfall but there's like a tunnel kind of carving out that way okay i take all of the water and i really just concentrate and i gather just a big tube and i push it down that tunnel i'm sorry that lava cave just looks important yeah okay okay also it looks like there's something eating those trolls yeah i agree with vex on this one yeah look what it did to you i think you were at least 150 feet across that bridge when he did that to you but the bridge was like 250 feet across right tunnels that go deeper and i can control water for at least an hour it lasts a while i'll go with vex that-a-way i can cool lava as we go we can go in there i can make that stop happening i'm just-- i would much rather face random beasts who are just random beasts than mind flayers who can suck my brain out i think-- i don't think a boss battle-- i don't think we can fight this guy and win water holes tiberius you haven't voted a draconian-- you come from a political family okay well if this doesn't work we're going to the tunnel can't-- wait wait wait why can't why can't vex and i just at least go check it out before we do this (sighs) let's do it fuck it they don't control us let's do it we're going yes we're just checking it out we're coming back we're coming back just wait ten god damn minutes i take the river flow where the water's flow is coming out of this waterfall-- -- and i reverse it okay oh i can i go into a black panther form panthers have like advantage on stealth something like that 16 13 so 16 plus whatever-- -- the dex of the panther is no it's whatever the dex-- it's gonna be like-- it's gonna be like 20 or something like that plus four no plus six no we were scouting you can't take our carpet we're on the carpet oh that's right we did transform okay sure you can take the carpet can i do a nature check to see what the scratch marks look like if they look like any type of beast i might recognize any type of residue any type of slime they're telling us not to be stupid because we don't have support should we be stupid right why don't we just go back maybe to the entrance of the-- what is she-- what do they look like i drop to my knees and i look at him and just say it's okay we're friends i take my druidcraft and i just make a little flower and there's a pretty little tulip and i lay it at the edge of the barrier with disadvantage okay nine i'm not a very charismatic person we don't want to die either let's not die together come on vex (meekly) hi you found the right motley crew (all laugh) would you like to come with us meet our friends we have friends tiberius-- we did see friends this
