squealing) and turn into a goldfish well i'm assuming the goldfish would make it easier to hit water i don't think flying fish actually fly though i would just pop back to myself i wouldn't die no i know no it's fine we're gods that would be kind of amazing you are lying you are lying by hitting rocks wait what you are lying wait i thought you were trying to make it out like i'd still hit water this is the best thing that's ever happened wait was i supposed to turn into a flying creature and be safe from this yeah i thought i was going to hit water and it would be cool (screaming) that was higher than i thought i've been really stressed out here lately and that might have been very impulsive and i might have been blowing off some steam and i'm really sorry (crying) i thought it was going to be fine i didn't know there was going to be rocks oh it might have been a last-minute panic thanks that was-- i could go get it now it's fine i'm here now i feel really bad because-- i feel bad about that i'm sorry i can go get the thing i still have a beast shape left okay it's fine i can go back and get that diamond now i feel really bad right now i thought it'd be fun i haven't had a lot of fun here lately okay it felt like the old days of when vox machina was back together because we've been away for a while it's fine it's been a lot of responsibility here lately and a lot of being an adult and so i was like vox we're reckless that's gross don't it felt like blackness it felt like a lot of adrenaline and it was super exciting and then next thing i knew everyone was super concerned about my well-being no did you guys know hitting water and rocks from very high feels like hitting rocks what's this i just dove off a cliff so fuck it at this point oh jesus 37 i'm fine

that (laughing) it was totally a fail video i thought i could make it so i hit the rock i should have bailed out as a bird i love how out of everything we've seen what i just did was apparently the most fucked up out of everything that's happened to us and now we need therapy now we need therapy if i have a piece of one of their belongings yeah that definitely helps yeah do i notice grog looking uncomfortable i don't know do i no i look awesome i'm a little spacey maybe for a little bit it's hard to say what was his name can you tell me anything else about him that would maybe help what does he look like all right should be enough i'll do an actual scrying spell what's that hilda if he is on this plane of existence i don't know if it's a good sign but it doesn't mean that he couldn't be lost somewhere else my spell only extends to this plane of existence but there are many planes i can try again well that's not good i don't think so do i have any further inkling are you insinuating that jb isn't trustful we like untrustworthy people none of us are trustworthy it's good oh shit and steal their plants from outside nightshade he's learning business did you find a ledger is that what you found what makes them interesting are you giving someone parameters by which they don't really have rules to follow right so it takes a peculiar person to know what's peculiar yeah (death rattle) not like this that's actually really accurate what does a smiley emoji mean i don't understand you saw the cloud what did it look like the same tower we saw in the nine hells it is a full moon tonight isn't it or was it last night when was the full moon are you getting it over our earpieces hi sorry i had weird dreams my dreams are on this plane i was in emon not that long ago i had to talk

last time i tried to scry on scanlan everyone gave me a lot of grief about it who is all in the room is it the four of us it'd be better if i had something of tary's hey doty what's up bud okay i'm going to professor xavier this shit and put my hands on doty's little head come here bend down down doty doty down doty kneel doty take a knee doty down you know what it's fine and i'm going to do the scry i don't know what she is making don't fuck me gil oh okay just straight intelligence 17 she's making arrows (gasps) (shouting) bitch fucking bitch god (shouting) people wonder why we have trust issues (shouting) it's fucking hilda she's a vampire or a werewolf or a lich or something i don't know don't quote me on any of this she was just like i don't want your vitals going down and why do people take everything away from us (yelps) ow okay i saw tary yeah he looked unconscious and it was hilda and she had ink-blue sparkly skin ink-blue skin and long silvery hair that was in a top long ponytail thing long green-- and she had burgundy armor he was in a wooden room somewhere in a hallway her ears were pointy i know a lot of people have pointy ears including myself so i'm not judging anyone who has pointy ears she sounds like those things you have said before yes the drow yeah like us but blue skin white hair and she said she doesn't want him losing too much of his vitality and that she was going to take him back to where he came from and that he was special yeah she was bringing him home to his piece of shit family but why is tary special i don't know this seems like she was interested in something other than his money yeah do i have any idea of the hallway and the room of how far away it was he could be literally anywhere within a hundred-mile radius or very far when jumping off a cliff actually who is good at math oh percy you're good at math well when was the last time we saw tary yeah exactly a train traveling by foot she was making arrows what was that thing you said turns field and what was the other one and i couldn't try and do a nature check to try and figure out what direction the wind was coming from when it hit me during the scry am i helping you are we doing this together i'm giving you the orb yeah i feel like you did this before successfully i underestimated you do you need my help okay and i'm going to try and figure out a discerned direction am i with him in the vision the closest tree that we've ever been to was the one we used to get to draconia but i don't know how close draconia is to him i can try and scry on where they are and look and see for the biggest tree myself and pop out right there can i scry on deastok and people that i have connections to instead of choosing a creature but i could try and scry on tary again and get a nearby tree do we have any images or any books here on deastok that i can look at and then try and scry on and then after i have the knowledge it still wouldn't be enough time we have to bamf there yeah do we know how close draconia is yes we could is that the same day i thought we slept so that was today i could do it again and then i can misty step us and then i would be out of my 6th 7th and 8th-level spells i would be burning higher spell slots to get us there but i could do it you have no books here on deastok none in whitestone yeah (groans) all right to draconia let's go everyone the uber will be here in five minutes we bamfed through the tree right that's right we grew them a forest oh my god that's right off the edge of a cliff (laughs nervously) it's a theme oh this is deastok okay we can't take him with us i mean we would have had to have had-- no we didn't can we still see their tracks if we went back and looked that would be a ranger question i could try commune with nature but it only extends for a few miles how long does it last plus that's a concentration spell the mist form is my concentration spell so we should be able to do both at once correct if we move quickly while she has her locate object on penis (giggling) his tary do we backtrack but we're over the city so we theoretically haven't intercepted them yet but she would still theoretically have his clothing it would still exist i do i can do one of two things i can either scry on them or i can do a commune with nature spell all right scry is the sun in the same direction that we're heading okay and he's conscious which is good he's still alive yeah we won't see his dangling bits just the one you guys does this make us highway bandits are we highway bandits oh cool oh wait did you want someone in the middle of the road unassuming okay i'm going to go into crow form (caws) i'm going to aid to her bird lady aesthetic i follow pike and peck at her bread crumbs as she crosses the road i take off in crow form we're gods remember same as percy but as a crow (caws) i fly down to pike's shoulder and i go (caws) i fly over to percy's shoulder and i go (caws) i'll go ahead and drop form so i'm not a bird oh i always forget that i'm so sorry i'm learning still sorry here let me just-- there you go i catch up to tary a little bit and i go hey are you special in some way is there something about you that's magical and special that's true is there a reason a vampire would want you do you have special blood can i look at your eyes that's true do you know anything about your bloodline is there something about you i feel like i have an essence about you now okay wait you that's a lot that's literally more than my entire tribe owns i know we own more than my tribe owns i know i will say tary i think you are special you have very large dangling bits along with your earring very large other bits is it all right no i thought that was a compliment and the last time you spoke with her was when you left i'm assuming it's not honestly maybe we should just go talk to her first hey but you're thrifty you're good yes you are taryon i've seen make amazing things you can survive you've been to the depths of the watery abyss and you've lived kind of no that's not the lesson of the story you guys no not the lesson not the lesson we're supposed to take away i don't have an alternative for the lesson it's just not the lesson yeah we're gods was it 1000 feet yeah all right 360 points technically i don't think falling damage counts as weapon damage i don't know if you can take half damage oh half damage well for anyone who has been asking i am okay i did not leap off the cliff out of some weird parallel allegory this was not a cry for help not a cry for help i thought it was going to be dope that's it i just thought it was going to be cool as shit and then it wasn't yeah you'd know if it's a cry for help in my head i was an awesome cartoon and it worked 100d6 dice yeah
