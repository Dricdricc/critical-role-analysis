oh man i feel like he told us (laughter) what is his mother's name you don't care about his past you're not sam riegel you're not sam riegel you're killing it man it's pretty nuts yeah big seats i'm going to break a pool cue (laughs) i want a bruise man it was a weird time i feel like when people talk about dc comics they just only vaguely talk about dc comics these days he's our personal trainer we did a hamilton work-out yesterday oh man it was so cool well i rised up when doing squats and if you go to itunes you can get the signal boost ringtone for your phone and it's pretty great also we have another surprise coming next week that i'm pretty stoked about but you have to wait no one probably cares but i care he's pretty cool and he had a cool hat i was much happier no what was that the thing i think this is my leadership thing yeah i get another thing i gave that cloak to kerr-- -- who wore it away what like it's day one vox machina let's do this it's our save game plus yeah i mean i'm the chief i can do whatever i want right i don't know actually i should maybe talk to dad yeah i go talk to dad (laughter) korren i was wondering if i could have a word with you for a minute can i is that allowed i don't really know you should fire that guy shitty servants yes that's true i guess okay right so (sighs) i'm confused was the aramente my training to be a leader you apparently prepared me as best as you could before i left i don't know how well you all did (sarcastic laugh) so i'm just wondering if i need to expect that again is this just me figuring this out again or do i have guidance i did that (laughs) you're right you haven't taken it but that's been about 5% of my journey all of the lessons that i've learned have been in the in-between i know i guess i don't know just trying to figure out how to navigate this like the leader i'm expected to be you know dad you didn't tell me a lot about the world and sometimes i think i get angry at you for that why didn't you tell me that the world could be so cruel and mean why did you never tell me that what okay it just sounds like it was advice coming from people who didn't really fully know i know and i thank you for that i guess i'm just wondering what's next now what i agree our people need to be connected to the rest of the world that we've sworn to protect i understand the need for our isolation but i often wonder if we had a few close allies on alert if the thordak incident might've have gone a little bit differently i still need time with vox machina we still have things we need to complete and then i promise i will return thanks dad okay dad thank-- okay i do the same adjust my mantle a bit another question do i have to wear this like all the time it's a little unwieldy it feels a little froufrou-y kind of ceremonial it's just a little feel like i'm going to trip on it okay 'cause going upstairs in it like in the heels it's a little unwieldy i mean it's beautiful i'm going to go get a drink okay yeah (laughs) so good i can get us there correct i can get us somewhere within the city of dis i don't know if-- built dis city it was too easy it was yeah but on the outskirts oh wow these are a power surge in there it's very bright i don't know i feel like we've gotten a bit of a reputation for ourselves i'm sure that word has spread we're not you know-- yeah that was super confusing that was the one that we wished our way out of the contract yeah we don't really have that anymore no deals no contracts just don't touch anything like a muff like a hand muff (laughter) we could put little ears on we can make it like a kitten nope exclusivity so percy we know a lot of things and people move through the nine hells what does it say about rakshasas in there where do they fall in the caste because he listened to you so much more as we move on yes i feel like we would have to find someone to send message there is a message spell maybe in the form of a text yeah (laughs) i mean we kind of did-- we'd also have to see if ashley would be down with us you know-- -- kaiju-ing pike once again so i'm curious if-- rakshasas aren't necessarily part of the system and this guy tends to come in and out and just make people's lives a living hell (laughs) hell we're going puns then maybe no one would miss him in fact maybe people down there don't like him you know i could use alter self or try and change into something that's devil-y i have a question because that is an interesting question because-- right it's transmutation-- because shapechange is considered a transmutation spell whereas seeming was an illusion spell can i alter self to a succubus to look like one or like a tiefling are tieflings a thing in the city of dis percy are tieflings a thing in the city of dis i wonder if they have guides i wonder if i can be like a tiefling tour guide for you guys yeah like an ambassador an escort already have you under contract (inhales) you know it's not my strongest suit and i recognize this does he have enhance ability is that what you are talking about he can give me enhance ability which means i would get advantage on checks which i can do on myself as well yeah so yeah i can give myself you know i can-- and tary can do it as well i'll talk into a mirror for a little bit practice some things that tieflings might say what are things tieflings say oh god i'm a tiefling what happened why is this happening to me see why yeah they're going to know i honestly don't think anyone's going to have a problem with us killing this guy it's just a matter of do we want to be full vox machina because it might paint a giant target on us or maybe have someone as a silent escort i could try and not speak a whole lot i could just-- maybe i could be a mute escort i had my tongue cut out yeah i agree okay all right sure i would maybe just keep those or give them to grog maybe once again did you just call percy 'freddie' i like it d-roll's pretty good hey tary do you have any spells that help you be able to speak languages isn't there a spell called languages not really (sings) disco inferno i mean if i wanted to use shapechange to actually turn myself into-- -- a succubus or a rakshasa then i would speak infernal because i do get that with-- we didn't really fully decide it never specifies because you get everything but you just keep your intellect wisdom and-- but you learn their spells and abilities you automatically get those it doesn't specify in the spell it's kind of what you decide yeah she's got a whip but i get their abilities all right maybe but i imagine they would be super-rare do we have any sure so it's not a guarantee that they know infernal necessarily i could go ask i mean i could go and get a few buzz-words you know-- -- hello goodbye please thank you left right what time is it yeah common i feel like we'll be okay unless-- i could try and talk to dad too and see if he has anything that might help with languages but i don't know i think we'll be okay we'll be all right right it's just hell it's fine okay so do we have a vague plan should we sleep yeah i saw that-- wait you guys all saw-- we really talked to-- because that feels like a fever-dream that happened you saw that grog you saw that right the giant white face grog indignant no expectations i like it i mean it's bad for goals but yeah high-five buddy hey word he does have a point has anyone stopped to wonder why we're all still alive yeah by all likelihood we shouldn't be that's fun good times good times what about you vex what are you doing after we take a retirement i mean we knew that 'twill be lovely considering your idea of small what is the grey hunt percy you keep saying what the grey hunt is what is it it's nothing it's nothing is what it is yeah is it like paying your taxes where it's not a real thing but you kind of have to do it because it's on paper and someone tells you to i learned it from you percy oh my god tell us something how do you mean divine like she can see things if she kills the radioactive beast does that mean she gets radioactive powers oh that's not as fun that's so cool oh you'll be fine she's killed tree beasts and dragons she's fine both so what are you going to do when we take a break percy you still haven't answered the question you know i might need your help i have a few ideas for the ashari tribes as well i think they need to can you help me build some sort of maybe like alarm system okay but with taxpayer's money also something else you taught me yeah just two cups on a string yeah let's do that (laughter) i get information on that gardener and where to find him or them or she or he i don't know who they are do i know her name did i get a name whitney okay sure okay sure when we were like kiddies oh no but she'd be forever-- yeah don't do that the bowing thing is-- i've always been uncomfortable with it don't-- no it's-- no don't it's fine no you're fine you're great hi good to see you oh thank you i was just wondering if i could actually just ask you a few questions on behalf of everybody well okay (sighs) i don't know if this is a sensitive subject or not i know you've been away from this for a little bit but it seems me and my team are going to the nine hells to the city of dis and yeah no i know we all had the same reaction (laughs) i just i didn't know if you could actually help me with any infernal language or any knowledge that might help or if you still know the language well we were thinking of going in under disguise as potentially as tieflings since they are more common there so i didn't know if you could share any basics of your language well you know hello goodbye thanks sorry left right do you want to do this over breakfast i can we'd be more than happy to buy you breakfast okay cool kuthok you're right kuthrek sure (laughs) no sorry i saw the hesitation and it was cute keep going no no no no i-- i mean-- maybe like a 'yes' and a 'no' and then we'll totally leave you to your work because i feel like i've totally interrupted like your flow and i'm so sorry doesn't excuse me from human decency (laughs) yai was that right yeah (laughs) yai fuck shut up shut up come on come on really she's not a felon on the run i've known her since i was a child she's a peaceful fucking gardener for the past 20 years mm it's the nine hells is there a word for 'thank you' do they thank people there (laughs) it's similar to goodbye can be both yeah i feel bad whitney thank you so much for us interrupting your morning is there anything you'd like from me in return great to see you see you again man so good to be home okay let's go vax thanks i don't look back out of embarrassment voice of the tempest motherfuckers first act of being king it's kuthok kuthrek yai and ermahgerd rounded vowels (laughter) metamucil you know it went about as well as one could expect uh-huh i totally learned all the language in one 15-minute setting of annoying a poor gardener okay hello hello-- kuthok kuthok yeah an emphasis on 'thok' uh-huh goodbye-- close close kuthrek yes yai no-- is ermahgerd it's impressive that no is the most complicated one i know she didn't remember a whole lot she's been living amongst us for quite a while in fact she never lived in the nine hells because apparently that was maybe vaguely offensive she's n-- yes i've known her for a while (laughs) what's her mother's name ermahgerd just words well we don't have 'please' and 'thank you' because apparently they-- yeah they're not very polite it's like the equivalent of the shia leboeuf 'nanananana' nananana no this is going great we are totally stalling time is a flat circle (sings) we built dis city on rock-- that was a bad song all right are we going are we going are we ready all right who dis we gotta hold hands and then-- good job bamf city of dis good i have to pee so bad nope we didn't i yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i can do it right now is anyone watching percy's got a good point we might want to try and get out of the street get indoors yeah wait from just peeking around the corner what layer of hell it's like the third fourth second what do you think if i do an alter self here that people will notice yeah i can do it at will yeah just shield me like we're changing at the beach look casual don't touch the wall you'll burn aww buddy yeah it's true yeah i'm going to-- oh he can do it on others oh copy cool i'm going to look like kind of a vague cross between whitney and zahra you know hold off on that i'm not saying it's not a good idea but maybe we should workshop it what-- hang on hang on we don't want to be-- hang on hang on how long does alter self last when it's just a spell because if we were going to try and eat some food and take a break then maybe we should do that first are we still doing that or are we just going head-on into this feel like our plan's already dissolving i can find it too matt alter self lasts for one hour okay so i guess we will get through this city and eat a heroes' feast when we get to our destination very very unique have we lillith she was so cute and a rakshasa i join percy yep yep and also that way as we start taking a stroll can i do a nature check to see if i can spot any native beasts insects etc native animals birds critters and the usual perception check that's a shithole roll 14 total you do like the theater do you think a pass without a trace spell would be beneficial here natural snitch yep just a fleshy mass liam sternly wow it kind of is if we can get to a safe quiet place i can do a locate creature spell and see if i can find him i can also scry on him but i need to-- something not in this back alley of a street was he talking to the lemures or to us to back the fuck off okay his yeah his people back the fuck off from my people yeah this means i could theoretically turn into him now that i've met them right nope (minnesotan accent) yo i got my polaroid with me he's d-rollin' i love laura bailing so fast do we recognise what they are are they wyverns what are they i'm going to try and start focusing on that for the next walk when one gets down close i want to see if i can see what it is i could beast shape into something that's natural-- weird thought what if we try to walk away from the tower once again i want to keep an eye out because i had a shitty perception check for any birds bats beasts that i see flying insects it probably was that's the thing it probably was how big is this cage you're doing great it was amazing is everyone here afraid that they're going to be murdered at any corner you're going to try to make eye contact with these people did you notice no one here makes eye contact with you it's really weird as we walk a little bit i just want to covertly heat up my hands light them up a little bit and then touch the wall to see if it burns me as well a little bit just graze my fingers along it even though my mantle of the tempest i ignore extreme heat it's what i was curious about s'good s'good it feels good it feels good stove cat wait are we interesting oh oh no it's not the same one i subtly as he goes by study and examine what he looks like the pit fiend as we move through the streets i just want to trail behind vax and take a look at if anyone's reacting to him unusually or taking notice of him don't fuck me gil okay yeah 24 it's all right it's all right they are following us does he seem to be following slightly behind in step of the dwarvish-maybe-creature yeah buddy cop i come over the comms and i say hey vaxy-poo i think we're being followed i kind of feel like they can smell you keep an eye out it's like a kind of stout maybe dwarvish man and a humanoid creature covered in chains i slip inside as well me at 1 am ermahgerd ermahgerd ermahgerd i look back at him and i light up my fingers and i give him the flaming finger guns super douchey over-exaggerated nod too conscious (laughs) wow wow vacation destination right here do i notice this oh no no no this ain't no hostel situation aw hell no that makes sense-- but still still no no we're not going to go in here to be sold in the middle of the night are we cool is this rock tartare oh my god we used to serve this all the time in the air ashari it was a delicacy in the earth ashari oh i don't know if this is rock crudite i kind of do like a-- oh it's so keyleth yeah oh shit (exhales) do we-- are we resting right now let's go right now this is like the best rock tartare i think i've ever experienced taryon-- buy the lot tary buy the lot good man and i like beastman shake him yeah i'm great i feel great they're soul stone slivers that's what they're fucking called that's some-- man you need to put a disclaimer on those bugs and bugs and bugs and bugs-- i cast black light tary you look like yourself again tary tary there are beds and keyleth goes and jumps up on a bed and just starts jumping on them a little as keyleth jumps in the bed on the background mattresses are springy here what i go with taryon to puke yeah what happened what happened when that happened that's really messed up because now i'm hungry (laughter) oh boy oh god my throat's a little tight yeah can you give me like a minute keyleth paces back and forth for about five minutes and then goes okay i'm good i'm great okay that's pretty cool yeah we're going to scry on hotis i'm going to scry using my 5th-level spell not the scrying eye because i want to use my spell ability and it's going to be awesome and i'm not going to be hiding from a soul that i accidentally consumed let's add to keyleth's guilt a little bit more don't say any of that i've got to focus you know not something else i'd want right now no none of these things fifth son of a-- god-- damn it to the nine-- or second layer of hell all right so i'm going to try again i'm going to-- we're in for the night yeah we're going to eat a heroes' feast we'll be eating a heroes' feast correct yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm going to do an 8th-level scry on hotis i also give it a good ten minutes let him get distracted and forget that he maybe just got scryed on oh fuck no but it was in a prison underground under the tower holy fuck holy shit yeah that's true just tell me to go do something in public that's all you need all right so i'm remembering it seems like hotis might serve the devil of this realm the leader the president as you have said a few times grog mm-hm dispator seems like he serves him and is in a prison you know what's fun i feel like a lot of the things we were looking for this whole time are all underground it's like an underground city man this is terrifying (exhales) well the good news is once we find hotis it'll be super easy the bad news is finding hotis super hard yeah i'm assuming i translated (gasps) oh my god oh my god i have a weird feeling that this prison is run by dis-- lord dispater himself james spader it is or like keyleth i know what a dick move that would be so-- they keep a fairly close eye on their patrons hmm i have a feeling there are more eyes on us here than we even realise yeah and i make a heroes' feast yep no windows all right big money no whammies that's an eight for one and the other not as good ten total i also at the end of dinner say i would like to raise a toast to vox machina for going and being together all the way into hell and back well all the way to hell and-- oh jeez yes of tary-- everybody to taryon darrington and with that i do inspiring leader my newest feat since i'm a leader (laughter) mine this is why i'm a voice actor and-- yes cheers to taryon darrington and his glistening armor and his flowing locks of golden hair and i continue for ten minutes about taryon darrington and his glistening boots of shining upkeep and his-- writing it all down and then i give temporary hit points equal to my level which is 17 plus my charisma modifier which is nothing so you get an extra 17 on that ten temporary well because i would hope that with my you know tary's golden locks of flowing hair and with my very impressive cape that i got you know for touring the world like a frequent flyer card what no you know what vex i'm still i'm still practicing with his belt that is bejeweled and his very bedazzled pauldrons and his-- very very manicured cuticles and i don't know what else to say for ten minutes about tary don't ask me please don't ask me i've also expended my 6th 7th and 8th-level spells it seemed like it was underground almost spanning this entire city we could possibly try and find a back entrance i don't know no you're not you want to come back-- vax vax vax vax you're not altered you're not altered hey hey i can do alter self at will i'm just not the best person to talk to people are you is that grog and keyleth grog and keyleth haven't done it for a while grog and minxie (laughs nervously) yeah i'm not saying i'd be a tiger i'm just hearkening back to our team-up well you know it's what we call a call-back you know don't worry about it you know grog and i can be very intimidating right grog yeah we could go back to old-school days and i could always go minxie little intimidation check yeah are going to change into something or are you just going to be totally oblivious that you're definitely not the people who walked in upstairs and i can do it at will oh jeez someone pick who goes down and talks i feel like grog percy and grog go go go go too much little much little overwhelming okay jesus oh man buddy cop go oh my god he fucking teleported you guys away somewhere yes knew that what's the catch and why does he want this certain someone killed i'm sure it's out of politics all right business a contract but tary's exclusive he can't sign any more contracts i mean barry barry's exclusive (laughs) barry barrington barry barrington-- (laughs) we definitely made a deal between ourselves before we came down here no contracts no deals make a contract but do we need help getting arrested i'm kind of with grog all i have to do is walk out into the square and open my mouth and then i'll get arrested a couple of us go and get arrested-- and the rest of us can follow along (whispers) it's like wearing the ring the one ring dimension i will say having-- -- having truesight if anything has truesight like the archdevils-- i'm pretty sure they can see into the ethereal plane with truesight but that's only the archdevils who might have it but it is illusory magic i'm pretty sure 'cause i think anything with truesight can see into the ethereal plane i think is it considered illusory magic it is transmutation i mean with shapechange i can change down to one of these little weird eight-winged insects we've seen flying around get in yeah the little insects that have we've been seeing flying around that might be little tiny very tiny imps i don't know of whatever i change into so if i get down there and i get caught-- i'll bamf into myself so the way shapechange works is whatever i assume first-- we need to clarify this later not now 'cause it's like whatever you had before is what you have so do you just have 1 hp the whole time based on whatever you changed into first right but if it goes down-- sure but it's whatever i had before so i can't change into something awesome then change into something less awesome-- -- and still have its hit points prison break-style it'd be so dramatic box cockina we can also always-- yeah all right wait what did we just agree to we're taking this contract it comes in pulses yeah yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah yeah archdevil or no hard to say i'm getting the idea that maybe hotis serves dispater dis-- yeah dispater yeah kind of think he serves him so we're kind of maybe going in to kill one of his literal secret spies think it's kind of what's going on i mean i can always beast shape there then have shapechange later you know i can do the whole be a flying squirrel in someone's pocket like we've done before type of thing how easy is it going to be to kill this-- -- mysterious person so wait we're expecting two of you to kill something pit fiend-ish level-- i-- what what is happening so we all kill the thing and then two of you get arrested and then the rest of us follow you taliesin and we're all getting arrested now what happened to like two of us getting arrested we could try and just straight-up espionage-- -- stealth this prison assault and i could do a locate creature and we could just figure out where hotis is and try and completely yeah prison break this without signing any contracts i'm not saying full-frontal i'm saying-- we're stealthy motherfuckers right barry is there any way that you can like (sighs) condense doty put him in your po-- no i'm really good okay really good i know you're talking about you and your sister but i'm really good too just want to point that out fuck off percy fuck off that had nothing to do with stealth that had straight only to do with dexterity which is not my strong suit (sighs) freddie fuck no they're not i'm getting-- (whispers) but we could find out yes yes i can i 100% can liam and i fucking cast locate creature level it's a level two-- a level four spell it doesn't do anything what and it has to be within-- but it lasts for an hour it's a concentration spell i can fly i can look and fly i could go right now and fly around while it lasts for an hour do a quick scout with fucking beast shape by being like a beasty thing yeah that's at-will yeah i don't have to be a big fucking bird-- -- i could be literally a tiny fucking bird or a succubus if i am a succubus though it's burning my 9th-level spell and we're done for the night what were the weird imp things that i saw flying around the gold armor imps there are things that fly here i can go going to the window anyone stopping me there's no windows anyone stopping me as i alter self and-- -- head towards the door no no one all right i'm going to go do a quick pass (laughs) all right all right all right all right all right i'm going to shapechange level nine i'm going to do a succubus i know i've got a good look at them and they can fly they're devils and they're kind of rogue agents i'm hoping no one questions this shit okay mm just-- quick loop i as the tiefling walk out of the tavern just very intent on my direction as i walk out of the building i take a left hang down an alleyway check over my shoulder make sure no one's watching and then (fwoof) into a succubus and take off fucking hell just a straight-- oh that's good that's good 20 total no no 21 total i forgot my proficiency bonus went up nope i stop it yep and i just kind of keep walking yes i start blocking around peek over my shoulder do i get a glimpse on who they are it's the dwarf again 30 feet behind me are we alone i'm still i imagine within range of the tavern just gonna say i'm being followed so be on alert same dwarven chainy figure no just wait a second i'll say jenga if need be i stop about-face and light up my hands and keep the hood up and just say i know you're there what do you want and who are you keep the hood up off-the-cuff do they seem familiar any idea on who they might be i say do you want to tell me you want to tell me who you are 'cause i don't have a lot of time to deal with this who's asking 'i' could be referred to many people including myself so i am asking-- what do you want with him i don't think you'd want me as tribute so you'd best bet tell me what you want with him because maybe we could strike a deal well is this creature willing to make a deal because the white one belongs to me of course (laughs) it's not really a-- not great six total (laughter) where are we going and if i decline i'm sorry i still didn't catch your name oh what it's kind of a pejorative you know do we need to know like-- what kind of i is this this royal i the royal we i didn't burn the spell right i stopped it i didn't burn the spell i stopped it right because i was like cancel cancel cancel come on man i thought it didn't burn either my passive perception pretty good shut up 21 all right fucking hell we're not slaves yet
