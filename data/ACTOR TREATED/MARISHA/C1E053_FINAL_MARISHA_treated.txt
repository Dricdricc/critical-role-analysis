so funny i know it looks so pretty you look like a wicked and divine character it's pretty great along with shaun becker and eric campbell couldn't do it without those guys check it out it's very good that was added after i sent out the announcements aw thanks babe aw thanks guys may birthdays oh yeah that's perfect i guess we should also say thank you hardwick-- we were in the process of-- it was the three ladies right i whisper to pike and be like mm we didn't think about this potential outcome did we child how long has it been since you've been away from your home delivery it's not what we did this for it's fine we're just glad he's home safe nope not a scratch if he has weird dreams-- don't worry about it children you know oh yeah he's great give him a little hot cocoa warm blanket he'll be fine can i reach down and pick up the statue tell me about this deity melora i might be able to help can i attempt-- hang on-- can i attempt a mending spell on it i hand it over and i tell her i'm a druid of the ashari people and i know several worshippers of melora but wasn't necessarily a believer of her powers and you're sure of this why should i believe thank you my lady i wouldn't make a show of it yeah i thought we weren't either i thought it was just the girls but then everyone started talking why don't we let this woman return to the rest of her day is he old and hard of hearing been around the world we give a big shove oh him having advantage because i'm helping keyleth hello a little wilhand did they want something in particular with you why did they want you i've heard the story yes i've heard i know you think the goliaths-- you were aware right okay yes yes that one two three-ish we're also going to need any and all recruits that you may know of or any favors you can call in if we are in fact going to fight this dragon it's fine eat food and talk about a plan i don't think i've ever heard anyone say at dawn we plan so i'm going to assume-- at dawn we microsoft excel can we get an early 12 angry men raise of hands on who if they want to fight the dragon or not do we want to do this didn't we meet davin shut up yes i feel like this would be a group outing time is of the essence what are we doing actually before we walk and talk do we get the general idea that it's safe to walk through the city right now without being murdered considering we just put on the most epic avengers-style display we also have your cousin zanror now at the head which seems a little bit more clever than kevdak ever was well look it's not a bad call the dragons seem to be interested in the power that they hold over the people there's no people no power he has to land to get his treasure if we had a little bit of time or if we're really really smart we could theoretically rig the most epic dragon trap ever right because even if we somehow by some insane chance defeat the dragon cool we've defeated the dragon and now the city is still under control by the herd you and zanror seemed to have a mutual respect so you don't think he would hesitate in a second to turn on us sure there are going to be consequences to this no matter what we've never fought like a full realized dragon correct you can't build a machine like that in under what a few weeks i feel like between pike and scanlan and i-- well look i feel like between pike scanlan and i and percy with his mechanical genius we can figure something amongst the spells that we know to make a viable trap i have a feeling they were very upset when we killed the blue one once again there's going to be consequences no matter what we do partially ajar oh we're leaving this up to a coin flip now yeah (sighs) i don't give a shit what the fates have to say who the fuck is this guy try a lumbar maybe a different result we're going up right up or down you've got the fancy broom you guys were born at the same time you're both scrawny yes i second this why is vax holding on i was going to be like look for the circlet just a reminder percy is a paranoid rich person so he knows things about them the ptsd is really starting to sink in while they were up there dicking around we were looking around at the middle floor anything good well that is without being said anything good that looks-- 19 being very gentle okay aw look they're doing it together it's iridescent telekinesis no wait wait wait what if it explodes the lock and then we're not able to get in at all we plan i want to throw up a gust cantrip in front of us to help shield us if anything happens is your unseen servant okay i do too i wanted to head towards the alchemical stuff to see if there's-- supplies primordial druidic sylvan elven yeah i start clearing out the materials and throw them in my bag what were you saying scanlan well i'm assuming it's there in case someone breaks in like would trigger a trap right wait and drez sent us out through quall so why are these things showing up wherever we go for quall oh that's right and now he made-- now we see the fruits of our labor i see we brought back the crystal so he could make this thing yeah i start looking around to see if there's hidden chambers loose stones in the wall-- oh that's true the hunk of quall i pull out the hunk of quall i walk over and i start brushing it away would it be a dark iron cobalt band i take off my very prized circlet that i love oh so much why'd you make that face and i put the serpent circlet on and i concentrate to see what it feels like and i hand my circlet to-- don't break it it's a family heirloom not windows 10 not windows 10 god damn it (laughter) i want to stay here and see you guys continue looking around i'm going to meditate for a second slight tickle of cold i concentrate on it and i see if i can manifest the cold i focus on the golem i look at the golem and i say step forward and i go sorry sorry and i go rise i look at the rest of them and i go holy shit and i say your manners wave to pike and then i say and a curtsey for vex this is the coolest and i say what do we say to those who we have just vanquished and i look at him and i say never forget that he has my mind that's what i was just thinking i'll tell him not to i tell him hey (whispers) what should i should i say his name does he have a name i like it spike is he spikey at all he's bludgeony okay i ask him are you called something (laughs) fassbender no enter the locket fassbender good work fassbender i guess we walk him out of here what kind of a spell it's a thing you've been working on i walk him out scanlan do you have a circlet right now you had the ioun stones do you have anything on your head well my circlet i'm a bit attached to it and it's very nice and has a lot of benefits to it i can wield i can use him honestly fassbender might be something that we use sometimes and not all the time anyway maybe well let's try it i guess let's make him invisible and get him to the mansion shit hey vex do you have a pass without a trace handy and i'm going to tell the golem to walk quietly and stealth or attempt to as best as he can (stammering) what why is it no why is it going up the staircase oh we're going oh i thought we were outside the front door let's get back to the mansion i mean it's a magic door scanlan can you just make the door a little bigger to fit him and i say grog meet fassbender fassbender grog he's invisible but he's a giant stone golem and i say fassbender shake grog's hand remember manners ooh fassbender scanlan named him you have a nice glow about you bathroom break that critters have power i want to try some stuff hang on i'm tweeting out a link for loot crate how big is the training area can we all be in the training area practicing our skills yeah let's do that let's go practice let's have a group training session you guys you're just leaving just like that we got to talk we'll train while you guys go what what what pop-pop's okay okay okay i do the mending on the sarenrae statue and i want to try a few tricks with the golem but throwing that out there go ahead it's true there were like a bunch of slimes and stuff down there status gained fall into a pile of shit never to get out i do want to do some exercises with fassbender who doesn't want to do exercises with fassbender abs of stone that fassbender okay he's not invisible anymore right you dropped that i'm assuming he dropped-- sure he is with us yeah oh yeah oh sorry grog fassbender fassbender grog i'm terrible at naming things i just go with whatever the first person shouts out oh you did say spike we overruled it with fassbender (laughter) spike ehhh not that one okay so first i say fassbender run and i want to see how fast he can go okay and i say fassbender punch grog he's used to this grog's fine with it this is how we train with grog it's fine we'll find out i say okay all right enough hitting each other enough of that there's some other questions first other questions first i cast call lightning and i just it's fine i bring down a bolt of lightning on a dummy and then see if i can also command fassbender to punch a dummy so would we say that would be like a bonus action what i just did no it was an action for each okay so then theoretically i can have a concentration spell up and be like kill that thing and they won't overlap a new command it's not a concentration to keep up that command so like-- keep fighting the dragon until it hits the ground would theoretically be one command that would keep going okay thank you speak and spell we found out if it can talk fassbender (laughter) can you gesture to me with your fingers and tell me how many years old you are (whispers) i don't think he's listening he's distracted okay hey fassbender cast a spell on percy (laughter) well look i wanted a live test subject hey to percy that's awesome percy you're in slow-mo you're slow-mo percy it's amazing it'll wear off all right fassbender can you drop this fassbender drop the spell it'll wear off okay fassbender do you know any other spells and if so cast them at the dummy this time i go up to fassbender and i cast stone shape on his chest and see if i can repair that crack actually before i do that can i do a level one cure wounds to see if i can heal him first okay do i roll a d20 for it eight points eight points so he gets healed by a heal-- how was that how did that feel was it frustrating good good (laughter) thank you that's all i need ooh fassbender can you-- i don't think he can fly fassbender can you fly fly fassbender fly how high is it jumping okay i stone shape i take a chunk of the wall and i stone shape a boulder and i hand it to him and i say throw it at that target yeah so his aim's pretty good and then i go fassbender high-five yeah ahh mm yeah you're my buddy fassbender okay thank you thank you it's very old okay fassbender rest okay but i like it-- it's my friend okay i take it off i take it off do i look funny you're a dick mm you earned it you're pretty awful from what i'm slowly beginning to learn about you percy (grog voice) i'd like to punch the wall the only one who doesn't wear armor is you not much of an economy right now yeah i'm pretty tapped out it sounds like there were a lot of people in prison last we heard i don't know if this can wait all right well when are we going to talk amongst ourselves can i pass and wait to hear other people's thoughts i think a lot that's actually what i was thinking we have the means to bail us out very quickly if things go wrong conversely you were a part of that lot once and you came out of it i think we're trying to save the world at this point that was the most impressive segue i've ever encountered you ever want a vision quest just let me know that was the weirdest coping mechanism i've ever heard of well let's finish this conversation over food wait we need to finish this conversation every chicken dish ever is wilhand here i walk over and i slide the bottle of ale out of his hand all right i leave the bottle of ale and i take the statue of sarenrae and i put it in his other hand tuck him up although i feel like we still need to finish this conversation shouldn't we all be present huh maybe it's time to split up maybe some of us help fight the dragons while others help evacuate you're going tonight i'll go with you it was ruined and most of it had been picked clean i mean it doesn't mean that there's not something still potentially there but i'm sure allura got most of the good stuff she's not stupid we can still check it out callback of wilhand's place i put my old-school circlet back on by the way but i have the other circlet with me i suppose we could ask the same of your herd leader zanror zanror if he doesn't have your allegiance in this room he will not have your allegiance on the battlefield let them go only big men talk big words that only fail on the battlefield he has nothing to represent any of his claims let him go zanror-- zanror it's not worth losing any of your men before we fight this dragon just let them go you're already losing 18 oh my god if i'm not mistaken i recall hearing that no scouts that have been sent thus far have returned is that correct and you have faith that these that you sent will when's it due for its next pickup wait 24 hours pike and i can take time and scanlan to heal some of your wounded gain a couple more to the fight we set a trap in the morning something big something heavy zanror-- i think percy just had an idea but vex'ahlia knows a lot about dragons she might be good to educate the troops also as grog mentioned we have people who could be very valuable allies that your people have imprisoned it would behoove you to release them so that they can join our side conversely any other type of magical enhancements that you can use to arm against acid for any and all of your troops it's definitely suggested it's like it's a real thing now
