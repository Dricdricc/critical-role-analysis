i've never seen it so big that's what she said oh that's so great after 4 pm and joining me is this glass of shiraz yay shiraz i do my first ever d&d character was actually with this guy he was my first dungeon master once you go matt mercer (laughter) i had never played before because i grew up in a small town in kentucky where dungeons & dragons was a ritual cult or something matt and i came out to los angeles and he ran a one-shot for me and i made a controller ranger it was fourth edition and she was a ranger that would cast control spells she was a drow yeah drow ranger controller caster it was cool i had bats i had a lot of bats i would make aoe's filled with bats that's what i remember matt and i actually didn't play that first game because no one else had played i was there as assistant coach assistant to the dungeon master i went around and would help the characters i basically just pointed to their stat sheets whenever they were confused on what to roll just pointing over people's shoulders where's my damage right there i was totally clippy don't forget your advantage no no one would watch that shit we gave ourselves a promise that if we hated it after six weeks and if it didn't take off we would quit and go back to playing at home no harm no foul we aren't losing anything really needless to say that decision was not made which i am very glad it was not made it's funny how things work out not a whole lot part of our stipulation for making it a show is that we didn't want it to change we were in pre-production for six to eight months with geek and sundry because they were in the same camp that we were in where they thought there's no way anyone's going want to to sit down and watch people play dungeons & dragons for four hours they kept trying to make it more visual one of the original ideas is that we would play to a certain point in the campaign then we would stop then we would all jump on computers into an mmo like world of warcraft and then beat the boss in the mmo we were like you don't know how dungeons & dragons work that-- no luckily it didn't go that way the benefits are one we're not waiting in between games for six weeks we only have a week so we can retain information a lot more since we're on camera it cut away from the side-table chatter that you have in a lot of your games where if one person's distracted with something you're like hey bro how's work going wait what happened it cut down on a lot of that which was good if anything we're almost more engaged there are no words i don't know man it's forever overwhelming and we'll say repeatedly that critical role is not just the show when we say critical role we're not talking about the stream that airs from seven to ten on thursday nights we're talking about the fan art and about the community because if it wasn't for the fan art we wouldn't have visuals the fan art really does add so much more to the show it's all so good it's all so good see look at how many it accounts for 50% of what we are for sure we're always so humbled not to go keyleth on everybody here for a minute but we're not heroes we're not special we're just people and-- i did but we're not we're not just to have anybody to say that we've moved them or affected them it's like-- i'm going to stop talking about it so i don't start crying on stage i drink cows (cheering) a lot of people ask for your improv-ed npc's give a quick list of your improv-ed unexpected npc's victor victor wasn't expected-- kynan wasn't expected right no wait kynan was there's so many that you weren't expecting never mind shut up telltale shut up big bird i think the hashtag vox moochina started happening after that based on this one fuck up i remember we were all so angry at ourselves after that because we were like man that was some level one mistakes right there-- can't believe we did that and everyone wonders why we're so paranoid (high pitched voice) god why are you guys taking so long to talk about these plans (crying voice) because people die this is real life go with it i'd go there hell yeah gilmore's glorious grooves (dance music noises) (dance music noises) you're going to like the way you look i guarantee it i briefly mentioned it before but he was my first dm and then-- that was just a one-shot and then i was hooked from there on out i think i had an adrenaline high for like the rest of the evening after that game and then from there on out i sought out my own games and then i ended up doing a buffy the vampire tabletop rpg for a while which was great a few other shorter campaigns little one shots and then came back around for the game before this one which was with you and yeah-- taliesin and a few other people that was our long running game for about a year well-- marisha and then from there jumped into this game that's a deeper question for you (sharp inhale) [no audio] that's it trapped i think to go off of that point know that the game won't wait for you so if you want to say something you have to make it be known i mean there's been a few times-- i'm sure you guys have all noticed most of them when something might happen and one of us will have an idea or want to try to say something and then a moment will come in and take it off in another direction and then it's gone but you have to let it go once again it's just like life that happens sometimes but if you want to say something you jump on it immediately i actually get asked a lot from my fellow ladies any advice for women who want to jump into the genre and a lot of them are very intimidated because it seems very male-dominated that's such a tough layered question to answer in so many ways-- i mean in two ways one we look out in this audience like half of them are women first off represent yeah ladies game hell yeah i feel like that's slowly coming out of that trend secondly i then want to address all of our boys out there all of our men because there is a little bit of onus on you to realize that it can be intimidating if you're a woman trying to come into this so if you are at a gaming store and a woman joins your group just be welcoming realize that that's not necessarily easy to do and it does take a lot of balls to walk in there and just be open and accepting i think so much about d&d is about being open and accepting because you don't want to sit down at a table where you feel like you're going to be judged you know i choo- choo- choose you we try not to be offensive (laughter) yeah basically there were evil eyeballs in a bunch of crystal orbs and they were like we saw what you just did and we're coming for you and were like well that's ominous well anyway moving on we have no context for that and kind of just kept going (laughter) that bitch is mine that bitch is mine that bitch is mine raishan wonder what who's that (fake laugh) audience and then they were like oh yeah by the way we actually want to do a pr q&a with vin diesel for like the last 20 minutes so you really only have about 40 minutes matt and he was so nervous jesus shut up i wasn't no i wasn't no i wasn't no that wouldn't happen in front of a bunch of people shut the fuck up (laughter) that was the most la thing i've ever done i don't know what i was going to say it's not important anymore wonder i mean technically if we want to get all actor-y woo-woo on you for a hot second the stanislavski method actually works a little bit like this where you make a table or a t chart and whenever you have a character you write down the ways you are like that character and all the ways you are not alike that character and the way stanislavski teaches it is in the ways that you are similar awesome you don't have to act and it's not a bad system because i could be a mile apart from someone sitting next to me but you're still going to have something in common everyone has something in common somewhere yeah by the by if you tag us in the tweet it does mean we can see it (laughter) and i'm like hey dude and he's like i didn't know i didn't know you-- hi hi i can see that we've been planning as a group that whenever vox machina's story comes to the end we want to have like at a tavern some drinks and it's us talking to st peter at the pearly gates being like all right dude so tell us this one time that the beholder did this thing and could i have avoided it and you just tell us all your secrets i want all the secrets all yes okay moving on (laughter) wonder i'm sorry what wonder he hasn't used that poison what a dumbass (laughter) love you liam if you watch this later (laughter) wonder anything on rule 34 (laughter) i forgot about that yeah it became like a test of willpower to see how long you could get through it i did what with-- how many of us were in one-- what jesus yeah that was extreme we love you just-- yeah yeah (laughter) audience (garbled noises) audience where are you going with this audience i'm sorry this has never happened to me i'm so embarrassed keep going audience perv-an perv-an (laughter and cheers) monday tuesday happy days-- whoa holy shit what is this stone what was the book we found in the store game empire and it was called gm's gems or something like that yeah it had a list of names it had a list of npc quirky hooks like has one eye and an eyepatch and has a limp you know so that you can just look quickly and be like this is an interesting person that i totally thought about it's like mad libs d&d wonder yeah i mean we know a lot of the telltale guys too but they--- yeah they're doing their own thing right now don't do that let's just say there are things being worked on i can't say any more ndas and shit we're working on it man and i do want to preface all of this with when you guys watch critical role we are pretty much 100% self-produced we work with our producers at geek and sundry but they are also producing everything else so we're very self-run so when you see the fan-art galleries in break liam does that when we do the pre-show announcements i do that that's all stuff we wrangle we self-produced our opening title video you know so it's just us and we're working as fast as we can yeah something about the gollum voice wonder go matt go if i multiclassed into anything so full disclosure i actually debated heavily about multiclassing with keyleth for a hot second but i am a little torn because honestly i'm still kind of going with the flow of the character-- none of us know what's going on we're all riding by the seat of our pants with this one so you guys know about as much of keyleth's future as i do because we're allowing ourselves to be affected by the story elements so it'd be stupid if i was like no i mean this is going to be my future i'm going to have an oscar in five years you know like that type of thing so we try not to do that because the world changes you so i did debate for a hot second when keyleth was very angry she's pulling out of her anger phase but when she was so upset at the way that the world had become and that she'd been lied to-- she felt like she'd been lied to so there was a hot second that i actually debated about throwing a point of barbarian into her (whoas surprise) so i thought about-- and i'll tell you the moment that i thought about it and it was after the fire ashari had gotten wiped out and i levelled shortly after the fire ashari got wiped out and then there was the few times at whitestone where i started using my fire storm spell and i was describing it as very like keyleth is enraged she's enraged and angry and she's crying and she's casting these fire spells so that was the moment after the fire ashari was wiped out that i heavily debated it but-- it is tough because keyleth's whole overarching journey is to try and become arch-druid and be the salvation to her people so yeah wonder dance monkey dance dance monkey audience i'm just enjoying overwatch like a happy person (laughing) (screaming) (cheering) hi audience hey body pride right be comfortable with yourself no body shaming free the nipple (cheering) dragons are destroying the world you think we give a shit about seeing each other's titties yeah you're experiencing it with us which i think like you said is why it's so engaging when there is a huge plot line reveal we're reacting with you guys yeah i think the only time that i've really-- like the gilmore thing that was totally circumstantial that just worked out the way it worked out dungeon master ♪ happy birthday to you ♪ woman with
