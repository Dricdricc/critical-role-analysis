gilmore shirts the gilmore shirts are still up along with socks vinyl stickers mugs patches bracelets pins hats nail wraps logo shirts the disturbingly comfortable 'how do you want to do this' t-shirt and hoodie and more but not really more that's actually i think everything (all laugh) yes i can officially announce as of yesterday that i am one of the new hosts of gamestop tv (all cheer) yeah exactly i'm a little kooky that's true yeah it's like the ouroboros kinda thing and last but not least as always talks machina's live on tuesday nights at 7pm on twitch with the illustrious brian foster and don't forget 'cause i feel like not a lot of people are doing this really and i see so much don't forget to submit your gif and fanart of the week to the contest and use talksmachina@gmailcom to do that put it in the subject be like 'contest entry' because that helps people who are poring through your emails that's it that's all we have done and done so what time is it here oh it's late me neither actually is uvenda still around she's still there are we still in front of her sorry i hope i'm not interrupting i was just curious i guess if you had any advice for tomorrow morning is there anything i should know in particular about the kraken right you mentioned it being hungry what does it hunger for and i imagine it's pretty dark down there are there other creatures that live in the rift all right is there a particular creature that you know is good at evading this kraken all right okay yes no that's-- -- that's not really a beast i can turn you into-- well i know that taryon and i can alter ourselves into merfolk and you can also-- how many people can you imbue with your powers yeah could you give alter self to others definitely (sings) we are the daughters of trident oh my gosh yeah yeah i agree let's talk about this over a heroes' feast how's that who what sorry we get carried away do you have a training ground like an arena that's kind of comparable we can test in tonight we're leaving in the morning do we want to practice now and eat later or eat now and practice later yeah so fight first yeah we shouldn't swim after eating cramps so we're doing this in the morning right we're leaving first thing no we're leaving in the morning though at dawn at dawn we swim then i'm going to go ahead and cast water breathing on all of us now because it lasts for 24 hours up to ten i believe i think it's up to ten let me double-check i'm pretty sure it's ten ten willing creatures yeah go find out that's why we're here man we could be great whites we could be sharks i can also change us whenever we feel like being something else it just takes a turn rock it like an electric eel sorry tary respect can i imbue one of your mystical coins with one of my spells that we give to other people or is that kind of your thing oh sure yeah i'm sorry i'm farsighted so sorry i did not mean any offense i mean you're gonna take full credit for it later aren't you all right no that's fine i mean-- you know-- (laughs weakly) moving on back to planning i could give you an animal form shark i've gotta give you something kind of real kind of beastly but it is challenge rating four or lower which is awesome that's cool you keep your bonuses yeah i think so yeah yeah yeah yeah wait we're still underwater right (garbled underwater speech) with animal shapes so you can't benefit from your equipment and it's our movement speed which isn't very fast correct could killer whales give us a movement speed of 60 swim feet he was into sharks but he has something against whales they're faster yeah they are it says in the book that they are definitely faster you guys were down with manatees but have something against killer whales i feel like our priorities are off i mean if we use pass without a trace right i mean pass without a trace should still work underwater if we're all something super stealthy we move super fast get there and get out it seems like it's marianas trench levels seems like-- here's my thought certain of us are gonna be better under the water with our natural forms and some of us aren't half of us go (laughs) half of us are animals the other half can ride them in our alter self forms like a seaworld show because i can alter self at will and you have to take a spell slot or can you do it at will yes it means one of us might have to borrow your bag of holding tary you had a bag of holding right all right the lodestones in no you cannot keep them run yeah yes it's true tigers aren't that bad well if you drop back down to zero hit points you'll revert back to your normal form being able to water breathe full hit points yes uh-huh 90 90 i don't know if there's anything else better i also don't want you tired tomorrow there's something that i want to try really quick if you guys could back up or maybe get out of the water i want to see if i can cast spells underwater i also want to see what lightning does so if you don't want to get electrocuted i love that this is all under the assumption that we just had this planning sesh underwater oh we're treading okay you wanna see i'm gonna tread back from grog go underwater and i'm gonna do a call lightning bolt see what happens yeah that's what i was curious about that's exactly what i wanted all right then how about this i take out my spire and i do a chain lightning out of the spire okay so i can cast out of the spire and-- cool while i'm under there i want to beast shape into a killer whale i goose grog a little bit from underneath it's fine (laughs) (laughs) uh yeah that definitely hits (laughs) (groans) oh no oh no i drop form out of shame (all laugh) well i'm in like a tank which is even worse i know this feels tactless i'm out (all laugh) that's a good point well if i do alter self-- let me actually try that i alter self to be able to give myself-- gills and like fins and stuff and then-- now can i cast yeah what about my water breathing-- -- we should still be able to talk okay but you can't go (garbled underwater noises) i think it's a potion of waterbreathing could i speak into the jug-- clearly what is a diving bell killer whales and-- all right who's whales who's riders rider trinket could be a whale i thought you were being a rider yeah all right let's go eat food yup hot fudge sundae 2d10-- -- which i will roll for you right now and we-- both are cocked (singsong) landed on the side that one-- is that still cocked god damn it shut up an extra 11 wisdom saves no fear no poison 2d10 oh that will be super frustrating if we just took all that time or if this is one of those-- solved-- making problems complicated for five years yeah that's great it does we totally didn't we should have asked what equipment was available (all laugh) i feel stupid oh yeah and that will immediately go away-- as we go underwater if you alter self right can you make yourself darkish oh okay well if it's dark-- so much fun yeah i like i like the latter malaise of fear while they're winding down can i sneak away and see if i can find uvenda i turn to her guards and say do i wake her up does she not like being-- i don't want to be rude but i kinda need to talk to her and i'm only here for a few more hours and i-- ah that's how you do it hi uh yeah i was just curious i'm so sorry first off-- you mentioned that there were only remnants of my mother that came back was she defeated by the kraken or do you think this was from another means do you have any more information on her and you're sure of this this is what the kraken does to people hm i was just wondering if there was any other potential explanation or-- how long ago was this really all right that's not that long really did she stay long all right i was just curious thank you did you keep anything from what you found okay well i appreciate that much thank you for doing that oh it's part of the duty well i should be getting my rest yeah big day swimming lots of calories i'm gonna go now all right bye goodnight did you just follow me were you following me just now oh all right okay yeah sorry no i'm good i'm good i'm great yeah a lot yeah a lot riding on this but-- a little surreal that we're here yeah what i'm just glad i have you all he was a good man uriel was also blinded by his unknowance of a lot of problems so i just hope i don't follow in his footsteps in that regard thank you for believing in me anyway we should get some sleep it's a big day tomorrow heehee hee i pet them a little oh god that weird poetry (all laugh) is he god that's so cool oh i find uvenda i take some time in my morning prep to do a little meditation and i take my flame hands and i do some like traditional ashari war paint kinda thing going on yeah yeah oh yeah mm-hm as long as he doesn't hit zero hit points then he won't turn into a bear but he has water breathing as a whale that's me well if you cast pass without a trace it's a concentration spell-- is alter self a concentration spell oh i could cast pass without a trace though i did bring it today i could-- yeah wait one two right animal shapes takes my concentration so i can't do that but you could cast it-- i can go ahead and cast animal shapes on her but it takes a turn a round for me to-- an action to change her into something else so can i cast it on her but leave her as vex for now no i know okay never mind 'cause we need pass without a trace for her right you can cast the coin okay all right uvenda these beads can you guys also track where we are based on them no all right i go ahead and i druidcraft one of my bark bracelets to put around her for scrying if you need it durent so someone you would find at venice beach are you gonna be with us the whole time or are you just getting us there of course there's doors to the other planes that's our people's job i go in first oh right are we doing this now animal shapes last for 24 hours yeah he's gonna be showing us the stones first right so yeah jesus i go in first i can't-- nope he's a construct the portal to the other dimension is underwater and through a rift you're gonna have an excellent book on the mating habits of seagulls when you get back keyleth goes up and touches one and meditates on it for a second really are the throat beads green do they look similar do the beads tend to react when they get closer to the lodestone i turn to durent whereabouts do they tend to be found the lodestones all over buried magnetic percy do you have a compass really you don't have a compass really really you have a compass will you keep that handy you know sure and a hula shirt i tap it because i've seen other people do that and i feel like that's what you do with compasses ahh do you want to be the compass man are you gonna man the compass be navigation the navigator so when we get through the void and maybe we can do a locate object and then pass without a trace and then i'll cast animal shapes and then we go but it lasts for ten minutes yeah i'll fail did you just say i'll fail okay bye jesus hi countdown the map yes i just noticed it yeah ooh elemental you'll definitely find elementals because they're definitely here a mineral (laughs) they're in the walls they're in the goddamn walls do i see that that's actually insanely helpful (garbled voice) no most do have blindsight or echo-location so they-- might not be good for us angler fish yeah mm-hm do we have a few minutes i can do a quick locate object spell see if we're headed in the right direction if you wanna-- can i assist her in any way all right wow you know taryon just gave me an idea thank you for your infinite wisdom taryon we might be able to use a daylight spell as a distraction worst case scenario because i can place it somewhere and then leave it yeah i can leave it as a distraction i don't wanna do it right now but i'm just throwing it out there-- that's a hundred percent true we've done that before just keep that in mind all right yeah all right okay we have a direction are we ready let's see how we feel i'll go ahead and do pass without a trace on us and we'll try and move in the direction that she called whenever he's ready he does have water breathing cast on him i mean he's a bear yeah (laughs) oh no no i'm doing pass without a trace i'm crying so hard oh wait we're all doing them oh that's good that's good yeah 34 rogues they get the job done oh my god (darth vader-esque breathing effect) hunt some scallops calamari some grog aioli a lil bit of mayo lemon i stand watch while they do this and just look for any movement don't fuck me gil 25 no 27 sorry i come over the intercom and say be very quiet very still very slow oh son of a fuck you don't motherfucker still keeping an eye on the dark figure i'll watch hit yeah i keep an eye on the big figure the whole time come on thanks gil do i do that too or no i'm looking no stone compass can i kind of start splitting the difference in case anything bad happens just very slowly 31 stealth (gasps) that's your stealth (all laugh) my god 45 and the compass yeah hey vax oh fuck it's a rock again yeah it lasts for a while oh jesus i

to find the lodestone locate object i'm sorry your hand is lateral towards the way your hand is going okay i'm going to use my alter self swim speed and swim that direction as far as i can do i get a better location on it i'll double my speed can i do another investigation check is it near me okay as a bonus action who's near me yeah yeah yeah yeah party members okay i'm going to do-- you're fine right you're great i'm going to do a grasping vine and see if i can get taryon out of the kraken's grasp with grasping vine a lot of big words can i get it kind of towards that-- sorry deal with me

lodestone's over here and that's all i get all of us seven that definitely hits that really-- that hurts 21 points i'm at 91 so 21 puts me to 70 right yeah what who's not grappled (southern accent) the later the hour gets-- the longer-- mom's been in town for a while laughing at your accent a little yeah no no i cast grasping vine which is technically a bonus action it should not impede with my concentration spell so we should still have pass without a trace correct nope i cast locate object-- totally ruined that sorry nope lodestone-- yep podcast coming to the alpha network project alpha big money no whammies big money no whammies just get out man it's a big-ass kraken though it's not bad yeah yeah yeah come on come on you're still blessed yeah inside of it yeah yeah yeah please don't kill the kraken gonna have a really hard time explaining that to my ancestors that's not-- no i could do that -- we can resuscitate the kraken find the lodestone i did tell you to find the lodestone can i say anything to him in the process i can i say (garbled) lodestone right there no this is the next one this is the next one i found it where i am i'm right there that's me the lodestone is over here somewhere (sing) that's me in the spotlight-- i'm still grappled hm hm hm hm so i'm still attached hm i turn to vax grappled and i say lodestone and i point with the best direction that i can with my remaining-- a one who's still grappled taryon and percy and grog okay-- i look at the twins and i say lodestone there-ish lodestone and i do control water and i'm gonna redirect flow and i'm gonna push all of us-- i don't give a fuck we'll be fine in this direction you see my laser i want to point us away so i'm gonna redirect flow and go poof and push us away from the lodestone in the direction of everyone else i can redirect the current of the ocean for a temporary amount of time all of us just me and the kraken and i guess everyone who's still grappled by him are going this way vax and vex are probably still away i'm going (sound effects) roll a d20 and add my wisdom modifier i've got advantage on that right because of heroes' feast ooh that's good that's a 17 plus 11 eight 28 ooh 28 fuck yeah it is did he lose his grip come on wait who me liam and not vex and vax okay get the lodestone bathroom i'll be back not concentration bonus action spell that sucks you know things that the player's handbook does not tell you i just want to point that out conjure woodland beings it says right here-- hang on the dm has creature statistics roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group you know i will say it's a little bullshit it's a little bullshit yeah yeah well okay so us as killer whales we're challenge rating three except none of us are killer whales you get one fey creature-- they're friendly they roll initiative-- and they sing like disney characters basically tangled but not you know but like for real they never tell you the best creatures you know that's a good point (gasps) is that a thing thank you google and you can get a hunter shark-- -- which is a challenge rating of two hunter shark and a hunter shark has blood frenzy which means the shark has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have all of its hit points we're those assholes right now i just wanna point that out just so long as we don't kill it just don't kill it please don't kill it i'm sorry i just saw a flash of my future i could yeah did you roll both 16s you did they're both 16s oh that's good sorry this thing looks very red to us this thing it's not red but on camera it looks very red to us this thing you're so grappled again aren't you you spent your entire action getting away from him fuck this holy shit okay hang on my control water spell has a concentration and i create a current-- in a direction for several minutes well that's just great that's wonderful motherfucker yeah i mean yeah am i about to be swallowed with grog 22 points you said 48 points do i see grog can i like-- a free action to be like grog i'm in the kraken as a free action grog (gurgling noises) or like-- hands lodestone lodestone dig dig dig dig dig you're so good you're so good no you're great you're great you're hot you're great you're good you're warm you're finding that stone more than us more than us more than us which i have planeshift if all goes terribly wrong that's true grog grog and i reach out he's saying do i feel him i still have control water as a concentration yep you're not wrong come on concentration which i have advantage oh i'm a warcaster that's 16 no i'll take the 16 what okay 22 okay and i find grog and i control water is it watery in this no water though i can't like jettison myself out of this guy's mouth all right okay no that's fine okay we have oil right i tell grog i say hold on and i cast a fireball right in front of us to try and jettison ourselves out with my spire with my spire of conflux i go (explosion) and try and give this motherfucker the worst heartburn he's ever experienced i'm making a dex save at disadvantage at disadvantage that was eight plus dex which is five so that's-- plus blessed blessed ooh that's good that's good that's 13 so that's 18 it doesn't say which is 20 if i'm fully equipped on myself i will be exceedingly angry if i have to-- i don't care about that i care more about the kraken at this point this is my life's work literally keyleth's life work okay five six seven eight nine plus four which is 13 plus another six which is 16 19 and a six which is 25 three four five six seven eight i'm sorry you said 8d6 it's actually 29 points please don't kill this thing who him no grog 18 points that i can deal with wait plus 25 so 25 plus 18 which is what-- 43 points of damage i am alive but grog and i are out do i still have a bonus action i'm going to cast healing word on myself at second level sorry that's two because i'm hurting oh i know four five plus-- six yep that ends my turn so glad i healed myself 19 points seven points even though there's my control water current going outward which lasts for ten minutes i haven't broke concentration-- i saved for it i already saved for it while i was inside of him i can save again it's not terrible my wisdom-- 19 not as good plus bless which is good wait what was that that was three thank you three sorry constitution 16 16 jeez guys gil gil bought us kraken blame gil don't fuck me gil player-killer not great seven i'm unconscious keyleth is unconscious that's all three right three we have all three also did my control water-- yeah trinket taliesin and you know they get it it's so close i know that's good though yeah it allows you to alter yourself based on what you chose which is give you gills and fins-- within moderation healing points i get 12 yeah yeah gets a little bit of a nosebleed not sure why all that inspiration yeah i'm just like a poodle over a pool right now just doggy paddling instinctually do we have the lodestones do we have all of them and i do animal shapes and i turn all of us to-- who's grappled a lot of us right i'm going to turn us into like little electric eels maybe it's because we made that joke earlier i don't know is that bad is that bad i just want something that is going to swim fast and then we all-- swim we slip out of its grasp and swim to the portal to the portal and we go there is a water snake which is kinda what i'm basing this off of the giant constrictor snake-- has blindsight-- ugh okay okay okay most are and hunter sharks are 40-foot swim speed killer whales are 60-foot swim speed-- but they're bigger motherfuckers so can we do a giant eel that's got a swim speed of 40 feet ooh i wanna be that look i'm bound by what the player's handbook gave me so-- so i'll go-- ah fuck whales are fucking big though whales are big so i'll be eels with a swim speed of 40 feet so we can slip out well that's going off of a snake speed it's a land snake okay but whales are 60 feet sharks are 40 feet that's our problem yeah we'd be slow to be snakes but more possibly-- (yells) we're going to be eels that's what i said at first swim 30 foot i wanna use a statistic for a snake but swim speed fuck i'm trying to be elusive here fuck go go go go oh god double movement i don't know what that did i did okay and we're still blessed okay that went off the rails that's not bad okay okay-- what (sings) shocking like electric eels sweet no run run run get out get out get out electric eels we are electric eels dumb idea that worked out it's one of those mega water balloons you take its physical-- yeah wait why is his eel form destroyed yeah all right all right all right is not the statement of someone who's arguing all right is literally all right that's fine sure did you skip me i thought i was after vax okay i confused you with percy okay who's still an eel don't kill it ooh oh boy oh that's good 15 is this considered a spell okay don't fuck me gil what am i doing dex save 22 for-- (gasps) not great 21 total for me i'm unconscious is that what you needed all the d8s for give me my d8s back (all laugh) yeah i kind of went unconscience unconscious yeah you know it's gil's fault no no no no get us out get us out leave it alone we have all the lodestones right yes i literally have fuck who is closest by the portal

just (sound of rushing water) yeah control water towards the portal is there anyone still held on by the kraken vax is still grappled okay i'm gonna take a grasping vine i'm gonna grab vax and yank him towards me from this-- who's got the thing from that-- that one closest by this one i can't see that can i see this red thing can i see this can i see this red thing in front of me okay i'm gonna drag him closer in i wanna drag-- send him this way [no audio] beyond it okay tary-- where's tary well bullshit all the way around then i just swim desperately doggy paddle towards the portal there's-- what's left all right i'll killer whale towards the portal where am i all right all right all right (laura laughs) it is very hard to see from what this is-- sure i'll go killer whale yeah
