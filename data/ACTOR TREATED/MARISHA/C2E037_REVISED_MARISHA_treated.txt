he said two words oh my god yes own it yes fjord is this like one of those like a parfait what's it called no not that one when you talk with other people who know how to sail that one oh parfaits are bad ooh oh caleb gave me his frumpkin frumpkin-- [laughter] frumpkin go spy on the ship [laughter] i go over and i smack yasha's ass is that-- wait that's what you said right no nope the wind lass oh i don't know how to sail so that's all oh yas queen ah ha [laughter] hey caleb i took frumpkin and i threw him overboard to go spy on things if you do that thing where you get all hazy we might see shit don't do it right now wait till we're on the-- yeah your bird's spying on pirates okay sorry when he means successful he means unsuccessful  i'm tracy [laughter cheering] that's good she's great yes say yes fjord say yes can i look around real quick and see if i see frumpkin sleeves are so big shit i think that was an eight this is not a good dice for this lighting 11 i lost another fucking owl goddamn it how far would that rummaging entail just curious how far you would look yeah yeah i second that question well i want to figure out if she's just another matchmaker or keeping it for herself if that is a thing aw we forgot marius we're not leaving though we're not leaving anywhere they're going to fix that ship well okay but still why would we run if we don't know what this thing is inside of you i'm assuming you want it out of you right so we just need information and then we run shit we're supposed to learn from these people are there like portcullis windows is that-- no are there windows does she have papers and shit everywhere while they're having a conversation i want to do a scan and see if i can see any floorboards that look like they can be popped up maybe marks on the floor from chests anything that looks like it could be a secret compartment yep that's balls big balls fjord-size balls eight don't fall for it don't fall for it she's trying to use them titties don't fall for it secret island that's what i heard too yeah you can get your crew in bulk that was a triple-aged gouda gate of the leviathan oh the great leviathan it's a fucking leviathan wait what tattoo was it you're uk'otoa you're the chosen of uk'o-- sorry the sound-- you have some secret tattoos that we haven't seen yet we're stage whispering avantika hold on let's take advantage of this is there anything else we need to talk about no no no avantika how can you be certain that you're the only chosen one of uk'otoa do you see why we did that do you often wake up vomiting salt water do you have wet dreams [laughter and cheering] also we're not just some dumbass crew we hired we totally murdered all of your guys so [cheering] jamedi is that cosko is jumanji-- he makes a note every time come on is he saying that like we're supposed to be doing something yeah white noise that means everyone heard beau and keg bone is what you're saying [cheering] it's a good night no shame no regrets you know there were several eyes in that ouroboros i wonder if that's how many other chosen ones there are yeah that shit ain't dreams man i don't know he's told us all that before yeah i think so well look i mean jester gets visited by the traveler yasha has thunder-- she has dreams and visions maybe you guys are just special or whatever the fuck they tell people [laughter] right well no it's like a serpent i mean look avantika seems like she's had this gift and these visions for quite some time maybe you could learn something about yourself talk to her a little bit hell yeah man laura and yasha you look trepidatious i disagree yeah we did say we were going to get better at that chick ah chick ah that's good you are a walking hazard right now no look i'm not shaming you for that i'm just saying maybe we should put the black powder in the haversack woo you got this (owl hooting) wait which sword what do you mean sword goddamn it oh my god details m'lady that was fucking awesome [cheering] we weren't listening to anything at all we know everything can you please fill in the details so eyeball hand you showed her yours was she i don't know did she say anything else about-- yeah and they're all keys to the temple also nott said that there's like a fuck ton of gunpowder under the ship so if she has a sphere and can talk to the serpent gods i'm assuming she has some sort of magical powers like you have magical powers she has cool robes and is wearing an amulet that just screams magic the flirt talk i mean he also had that all-seeing eye on his back right i mean eyeballs we all have two there's a lot of eyeballs around just saying things have eyes just trying to be skeptical yeah deuce has a point there's got to be a goal at the end of all those powers right did she say anything else about what she wants jessie are you all right you've just had this like really angry face in the corner for a little bit no it looks like the third pencil you've broken so i just wanted to-- just curious fourth that's a good question let's get some rest moses shit you're drenched in sweat just throwing that out there real soggy i'm not going to say anything let's go no we didn't look as someone who still doesn't have any type of dreams whatever's going on it's not normal i just want to point that out look we can know just like i know about your shit we can know about fjord's shit and we can just keep that on the down low right i'm interested in knowing about people's shit not exposing it one eye open oh and you think you do you the authority on knowing what other people want yeah me neither [laughter] we've heard fjord speak with a lot of different accents he clearly had some sort of fucking dream we know that he'll tell us when he wants to tell us all right well if you've explored it why don't you tell us what's necessary to bring okay well then go on what hmm is this not ringing a bell for any of y'all's snake people temples the naga we already fought them done this once before think that's where we got the little sphere thing that went in fjord's thing had a little circle with like a pool in it and you could see shit all right but hear me out because we fought those people in the swamp they were the merrow people right maybe they're still worshiping the same type of serpentine deity a lot of different people takes a lot of different types that's what i just said yeah that's what i was totally going for thank you
