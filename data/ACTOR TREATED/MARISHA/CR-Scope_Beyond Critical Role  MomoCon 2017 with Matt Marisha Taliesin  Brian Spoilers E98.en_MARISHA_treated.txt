don't tell him he's supposed to be here him breaking contract will be funny i love that this has the name of our panel on it for us as a reminder are you papa mercer is that a thing are you reaching godfather status i think my chair's broken my chair the seat might fall out it's all right it's all right i do get to reroll ones if it's elemental damage re-rolling that one it's pretty good it's all right it's above average yeah (cheering) a really low budget vr horror game happening right now yeah what do you will of me council what do you want oh my god brian foster who is apparently supposed to be on this panel (cheering) oh i'm marisha ray (cheering) that was going to be your-- yeah or the guy you'd like to have a beer with yeah guy you'd like to have a beer with i love that it feels like that you're calling the world series right now from everyone-- --the reverberation yeah it's just us i think we're hearing it welcome welcome welcome to wednesday wrestlemania is what it feels like it's true though there's been a few times that me as a very supportive girlfriend matt's gotten sides in and i've been like aw babe just taliesin' hearing him read through the wall and i'm like it's not good just give it to taliesin my favorite is when i get a voice reference and it's laura bailey (laughter) you always have people that are-- yeah me and courtenay taylor every time yeah i mean the real tips that you can get are just buy voice-over voice actor by yuri lowenthal and tara platt go to how to be a voice actorcom by dee bradley baker yeah go talk to fred he's here there's so many resources out there that are written down and probably way more eloquent than what we could tell you right now i mean honestly being a voice-over actor is the easier parts of being in the industry on-camera is scary that's a really good way of putting it oh god let's go to the bourgeois pig this'll fix everything what we tell everybody is when you go to interview for your job and you do it once and you're like whew awesome we do that every day every time you audition it's basically the equivalent of interviewing for your job and trying to convince people why you should be there the reality is you shouldn't no one should be it's a desert it's there's a serious water shortage you guys no one should be there and you dude people are cosplaying as brian wayne foster okay oh sorry i feel like every artist or every creative wakes up one morning and starts having this existential crisis of oh my god everything that i do for a living is just made up i just make up shit oh my god nothing is real what am i doing why are people paying me for shit this is all a bad idea what is happening this is weird why are people watching this yeah we eat douchebags for breakfast ooh oh no oh no this is a long story you guys i dunno are there any singular lucky breaks always bet on mercer always bet on him no i mean i feel like my career and my success when you look back in that introspective timeline of your life and it was all these little nudges and hints just pushing me into the same direction and these weird little trail of events that happened that lead me one thing to another i am obnoxiously tenacious like maybe to a damaging degree sometimes audience goldfish is very indicative of that i hate hearing no for an answer shouldn't say that out loud either that's probably damaging but yeah i turn into that toddler who's like four years old that's like well why can't i do this why and it's like well that's because if you jump off a cliff you'll die why well gravity and terminal vel-- why and i just keep asking why until something happens why why yeah break people down with their own defense that's true there has been like one maybe two times that taliesin has been to me leave marisha go out that story there's too many stories but no i don't know there's been-- a strong perseverance and hard- headedness and honestly just constantly pursuing what made me happy in what i knew i wanted to do that ended up putting me at a crossroads of acting and nerddom and it was perfect thanks man yeah best 50 bucks i ever spent photos are expensive change your hair you have to take more pictures and seriously on-camera shit is terrifying no we're web stars it's different matt we're twitch famous matt the family we make youtube videos with you're so insightful that's a good point though it's a competitive that's there but inspiring and you're always rooting for the home team oh yeah totally well you know when she dies i get the other half of my soul i don't know what you wanted me to say word come on shameless plug you brought it up it's pretty dope next year is your ten years marisha and yeah i automatically get my jeep wrangler right that just comes with my ten years i automatically get a medical marijuana card just with your ten-year anniversary yeah great i guess i'm going to go off the fiction ramp-- since we were talking about creativity and how to inspire that i've been reading through creativity inc which is written by ed catmull who was one of the founders of pixar he talks about harboring a creative environment and helping the creative flow in the workspace it's just really good for anyone it's good i think just allowing creativity to flow and not extinguishing anyone's creative flame just because you think that your job title allows that it could be a pa it could be a writer it could be someone in sales or marketing and anyone can have a creative idea and i think we all have a responsibility to listen to those creative ideas-- regardless of where they are in the chain because anyone can have an amazing idea i think a good leader will listen to all of those even if they decide to implement them or not well your name's brian foster i mean yeah well stop pitching porn and then maybe we'll talk i know but we'll talk back to the drawing board yeah there's a difference between getting a script for the scientology center and being like nah i'm good-- versus an acting role your white older drunk male is rubbing off it's showing you get advantage on constitution checks what taliesin said next question i thought she was talking to us a hundred percent i was like oh no (laughter) actually this one-- a few just came out that i can announce i am super over-dramatic and ridiculous and insane in the friday the 13th video game that's coming out you can kill me so many ways so many ways to kill me i am aj in that game (intentional mumbling) comes out on google it yeah that actually might be true-- i did have people tweeting at me how they're like i've saved marisha two times already i gave her a security blanket and some hot chocolate like legit that was someone's tweet the true heroes it's got a dialogue tree a canine unit you and liam as reverse flash in that scene that came out was like the best thing ever you're all welcome for effie being a badass just putting that out there brian you're doing so much cool shit and you can't say any-- he's on facetime right now glaring at you (whispering no audio) that's what happens when you fly american chibi-overwatch taliesin chibi-overwatch i would totally play chibi-overwatch especially if i got loot boxes for it can we bring house lights on a bit i guess we can go ahead and get started man in the dark what's your name audience i see your face now so awesome so many i was going to say the kraken fight was intense cows i'll never forget cows kicking k'varn in the face was pretty dope beep beep one was with taliesin as the director with me that i reference all the time that was akiba's trip it was i need you to attack like a cat person like a half-cat half-person and i need you to be incensed that as you're attacking your clothes are being ripped off because japan and so i was like-- i think because japan got dropped a few times and it turned into a (screeching cat noise) i don't know it was weird it was all right it was fine one of my favorite ones i think it was for the old star wars battlefront and it was this line where you're yelling yelling yelling and then i got to a certain point and it was like just more yelling i remember taking a picture of that one this is my job right now more yelling yeah if they're really good i think about patrick rothfuss and talking her down out of a panic attack quite a lot because the rest of vox machina was too distracted and too in the moment and he was an outside force that was like yeah let's relate for a second let's go outside and relate hey girl you want to go relate audience go relate and chill clank clank clank audience true disadvantage yep now you know why audience improv the hardest part is picking a few things and committing 100 percent in those cold reading auditions and even if it sucks at least the director knows you can commit make a choice making a choice is massive and then the director will say new choice and you go no i'm faye dunaway and then you go and then that's a new choice matt brian and never go full faye dunaway but that tells them that you're malleable and can be directed and can make a strong choice even if it sucks it's very layered audience no it's good great question first and foremost i always try and speak to our boys our guys in the audience and say you also have a responsibility here feminism is not a female-exclusive problem this is a team issue everyone has a responsibility here i do a lot of stuff super subconsciously if i have a big meeting i'll wear a button-down shirt and slacks and boots what i try and keep in the back of my mind is that i'm not the first and i won't be the last and there are more allies than enemies find your allies they will be your guiding force and your strength behind you but to definitely persevere you got this girl you good don't take no for an answer audience do not take no for an answer
