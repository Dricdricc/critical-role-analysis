it's going to be good it's a good episode i knew that this day would come are we being followed that didn't count that's good 21 like a thousand i hear you you collected wax seals you still have those that's cool actually oh that's not-- i went somewhere else yeah married yeah nott i know this place is-- this place is quiet but do you actually know if there a waterfall upstream a little bit or a brook something with some noise that might drown out anyone who's listening further off the beaten path we walk upstream maybe any babbling brooks which is i think where all those soldiers were going yeah you definitely puked all over that apothecary so it's clear that something's not right what is dunamis let's find a patch of woods to hide in does old edith know your current form she just thinks you're not dead nott you drowned you drowned and you just spent three months underwater that's incredible i don't know if you realize that but-- loops into caduceus' social worker plan actually do you think bryce would be down for more responsibility and obligations yeah that's true plus alfield is near the border and the gates shorter journey out then we try to find yeza is it one word pleasehelp you're cutting out and i can't-- leaving are you listening to where you can contribute hey jester since we're going to try and be honest with each other and turn a new leaf-- well in a way i didn't sleep with dairon she wasn't my roommate she was my teacher i don't know why i told you that yeah no i didn't sleep with her at all i totally made that up yeah thanks how to kick ass and take names bitch yeah i don't know i guess it's easier to pretend like you don't care yeah i'm a little transparent sometimes thank you i mean don't get me wrong i'd totally tap that but-- you got this man ew mister fancypants for the record nott i don't think it's us that's been rubbing off on you i think it's you that's been rubbing off on us do you care about us you've told us several times how you've been using us the dunamis i'm curious as to how much was for the empire and how much the empire was a veil for his own personal exploits trent ikithon was looking at yasha he was side-eyeing yasha i feel like i've heard these words before when we were in that bar he looks for prodigies people with innate talent i don't think it matters-- the cerberus assembly actually has a pretty heavy hold on rexxentrum i'd be willing to lay money on it nott sorry you were going to say something all right i was going to ask you a question i don't think you know the answer well if he's talking about vess derogna-- it sounds like they've been here watching your husband for quite some time which means checking in on your son it feels like-- it is a piece of dunamis right yeah and this thing that we had was called the beacon right okay the people that we saw fighting having the dc fight in the air full on anime battle-- did we recognize the-- because i know they were wizards that were fighting the crick assassins that were coming in do we recognise the clothing and appearance of the archmage and lady vess is it the same people but the same robes caleb you were in the library of the cobalt soul when you stumbled upon dunamis for the for the first time what were you looking for when you found it what were you trying to find you still haven't answered my previous question of how you were using us and what that means to you her guns are bigger than mine okay was that a compliment okay that's what i was going to say do you think that fjord was using us you think that nott's been using us you know we're also here volunteering our help caleb you were right when you said earlier that it's too late now that we're involved but i don't think we see it in the same way that you do it's too late now because whether you like it or not we all care about you and are invested in you know your happiness i guess so don't run you can say you don't believe in anything and that's fine believe in us just a little bit i'm sorry for not hearing you yesterday honestly you saying that you don't believe in anything kind of put everything into perspective about that conversation i heard that you were doubting me and us and our friendship one last time yeah yeah i have caduceus is a wild mom so many wine spritzers close i'm going to button up and go full cobalt colors complicated is that what you said poppy seeds chamomile black-eyed susans i mean it's essence of flower and bee puke it's a miracle well it's more of a-- it's fine i have this red feather from nila she was also a firbolg well yeah that's fair would nott know of a general physician a doctor someone local doctor it said in those papers about them being sick from the-- the town complaining about sluggishness i want to find demi leric (knocking) hi yes i'm beauregard of the cobalt soul i've been sent here from zadash if you have a few minutes i would love to ask you a few questions we're taking statements from people trying to figure out some incongruencies that might have been happening over the past few months did you ever notice any increased amount of patients feeling sick sluggish anything off not the most recent two weeks burnt-in-a-fire-type of off before then wave of nausea anything else what makes you think that they were related as opposed to general food poisoning what was strange about them did they all happen to live in a similar area of town all in a cluster sorry just taking notes just want to make sure i get everything correct okay anything else that seems like it might spark your memory of being a little bit odd mm-hmm did you know a man by the name of yeza did he come in around that time with the batch of people who were feeling nauseous it was all one day do you mind if i talk to a few of your patients for a second if you think of anything if you remember anything-- i don't have a card but i'm staying-- i'll be in town i might be back thank you miss okay i'm going to go over to one of the guards is the one who's semi-conscious conscious enough to speak i go up and slap one of his wounds 'sup name's beau with the cobalt soul yeah what's your name good to meet you jeff you patrol the cluster normally you look pretty badly burned obviously i give him a little bit of my wine from my wine pouch sorry sorry demi sorry jeff i was curious if you happened to know what happened to yeza ber-de-ger-de-ger-- brenatto or if you were around when the apothecary burned oh really the cricks got him did you see which direction they ran you're sure it was the cricks okay did you see anything else you were the one who got luke out all right anything else you remember anything spark in your mind trying to figure this shit out i know that's vague did you feel like they were looking for something in particular were they targeting places okay well look you did a good thing all right man you saved a kid my friend's kid i don't really care about the kid but it was my friend's kid so here i pull out 20 gold throw it on the table you can split that up with your friends or if you want to keep it i don't really give a fuck yep bye then i run away oh my god it's big it's coming from the depths just potential dicks are we meeting back up all right meet back up i kick down the door and i go apparently he was taken by cricks then i fill them in apparently he was taken by kryn i talked to some soldier boy named jeff i know right his parents must not have loved him he said four kryn came in scooped up your husband and ran off yeah he was there he ran in and he saved your son so much nature poop i feel like we shouldn't try and assassinate the head of the cerberus assembly not right now maybe we just made an alliance sort of with yussa we could also go back to zadash are you talking about the thundery one that's real loud it won't collapse the tunnel on our heads when you do it will it (singing) roll the dice all right travis and guys hot take the kryn aren't the bad guys i mean aside from the mind-altering magic that we've already mentioned all of us can change our appearance maybe what you're talking about about them coming in and using the crick maybe that's what they did maybe they did your exact suggestion first and they disguised themselves to look like the kryn and came in i don't know sam and rexxentrum yeah doesn't feel like too many places on the map are off limits speaking of when i was talking to the doctor demi she said she had a few instances over the last month or so where people were coming in feeling nauseous feeling not like themselves in a grouped amount of time all from the cluster you want to head towards xhorhas is what you're saying that's the thing you're talking about poking that thing the dodecahedron no caleb-- sorry caduceus freudian slip you said the life force was being sucked away from your grave from your home you said also to look for answers though right they left first you have any idea which direction they were heading you can speak to the wildmother you've checked in on a few of our friends do you ever check in on them see what the wildmother tells you i do it's a great name geoff with a g or jeff with a j yeah sure jester you okay what's wrong i mean nice is boring after a while we can get to nice right eh i'm sure there's some beachfront property open in nicodranas maybe if we work really hard and pool our funds we can retire you didn't get turned into all the things that you're afraid you are it's not how this shit works do you want us to still call you nott nott and caleb it is the mighty nein made of seven people works great nope (whispering) was the chair made by geoff (whispering) something dranas ghor dranas i am yeah i know what's yasha up to 19 would i know anything about that what was it that those letters were saying was under ghor dranas or they were looking for things i oddly feel more comfortable going to ghor dranas than i do going to rexxentrum i agree with what one of you said mm-hmm that once we get there we're fucking nobodies what are we going to do how long have you two been married yes (stuttering) happy anniversary right that's what people say right congratulations he's a little worse for wear but he said he had a few friends that fared out okay that are still around i could ask him for a recommendation yeah don't show up as his dad and ship him
