okay i'm going to throw open the door and just peek out the door and see what's up and then i’m going to come over my comm and just say status report where is everybody and that’s it meow the assassin doucher bullshit no gun stuff in relation to where we are i was going to try and handle that i’m right behind you in the room in the door behind you hey grog you want to jump from really high all right he’s just holding his action -

was it just me and you oh my god it was just me and you yeah warcaster you can cast when you’re on your back rakasha three-point landing i am going to move up i guess my full movement okay roughly how far away is he from me now the rakshasa all right okay 60-70 feet first things first i’m going to cast wall of stone and what i want to do is make it a semi-circle and wall him in with us yeah wall him in with us i don’t want us to lose sight on him but i want to make it like a - a cup yeah yep all the way how long can i make the wall i can make the wall i can do 10 by sorry if it’s 3 inches thick i can do 10 foot by - 20-foot panels it doesn’t really specify right now is it supposed to be 10 okay right right so i think that’s about right i don’t want it to be super thick it’s not very descriptive and when i do 3 inches thick i can create 10 foot by 20 foot panels - it says the same damn thing in the book you create a span of 20-foot length yeah and now i’m going to do a bonus action - see if this works okay i have a 60-foot range here so i want to cast a grasping vine -

problem we watched him die remember when we split up for the slayer’s take he was our contract nope vax and i watched him die he slit his throat yes it got blood all over the place yeah i think we need to talk to vanessa like he said yes be that there are assassins running around which was not part of the contract before the beading on it is gorgeous the rakshasa can disguise - he can shape-shift - hang on hang on add 6 to my wisdom oh add 6 to the roll from my wisdom oh adding my modifier right 14 wait does it come off it doesn't come off oh that’s a good idea i go and i look for allura and gilmore while they do that as i’m looking for gilmore and allura i’m alerting the guards of the visuals of the assailants three things there’s a few (laughs) in robes as i walk towards them i want to throw up a skywrite once again the de rolo crest just alerting people okay i'm going to cast polymorph on myself and i'm going to go as a mouse polymorph can i fit through the door i drop polymorph it's okay it's okay it's me keyleth sorry (shouting) i know i know (all laugh) gilmore rakshasa in the town pretending to be you trying to kill vax yes also a bunch of fucking assassins (scared) yeah (breathless) i found gilmore no this is real gilmore real gilmore as he says this i do a little cantrip fog cloud around vax's privies just a little floating fog cloud right around your waistline the old tutu a little censor bar well wait gilmore where's allura where's allura gilmore if they were after us and they were after you they were probably also after allura we need to make sure that everyone on the council is okay all of them say nothing i grab him real fast and say it was hotis the rakshasa remember from the slayer's take yeah yeah let's split up i guess i'm going to go look for allura still alive this assassin came through my window yeah well i actually i don't know i chucked him out the window he might still be alive a rakshasa his name was hotis rakshasas are devils from the nine hells and kashaw wherever he is we watched him die permanently is it one of those things where it passes off down the line or is this rakshasa going to be pissed at both of them i believe it's immune to certain magics correct speaking of those friends you said these rakshasas are master manipulators is there a group or an organization here that has it out for us in the meantime i guess it's time to drink i still feel like we need to reach out to vanessa let her know what's going on cost of the contract good point did it meet us he could be following us for a while veekar veekar so the only one that's missing in action is the one that i shoved out the window well there was one that was shoved out a window so hopefully he died i heard that grog like a surrender flag there you go hobo bindle your heart oh keyleth has been in the door frame watching all this happen i'm in the door frame or we could just drink we know who the fucker was we know who he's going back to to spireling veekar we know where he's headed galdrick a little hair of the dog oh yeah yeah which we could do you never know (laughs) yeah i've got time oh yeah i'm sure fucking blow-outs every morning (cracks up) i'll join pike oh no was it the crab cakes really the crab cakes messed with me a little what did you try on him pike i go up to vax does he still have the brooch on i look at it is this the skull i gave you you cast it wow that's impressive sorry ooh allura what did you try kima did you try restoration i've got greater restoration learned pike and i will tag-team a greater restoration did pike and i notice anything when we ripped out this darkness from his chest like by the rakshasa probably hey percy hey percy you find anything find anything percy oh maybe you should keep looking do a litmus test is it basic or acid we don't know ooh oh we just found a loophole it needs to go to a bartending class i light up my hands in defense is he still alive no we didn't fuck yeah glass sphere you found a magic 8-ball it's a scry -
