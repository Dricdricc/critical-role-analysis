the white and pink contrasting with the fur is very confusing to my brain liam and it's going to be so much fun oh man i feel like i was with vex maybe on the other side yeah five i don't want to talk about it what do we do you can't be paralyzed or restrained and our heroes' feast do you think you can dispel their magic bring it bitch it's a cone it's just going to hit us there's a hypodermic needle in here sorry keep hitting the mic just dex saving throws marisha and no i rolled a three so i'm at seven you said minus 38 right do you need help off the coals you're fine right okay i am going to turn and do a tidal wave against this guy in front of me so he has to make a dexterity saving throw tidal wave let me see (counting) i don't think i can hit both of them with most of my stuff i can but i think it'd also hit you it's a straight line 4d8 bludgeoning are we concerned about me extinguishing these coals we can light coals again right okay cool then with permission from vex i'll put you out and then i'll step out of the way yes i'm turning into a sauna i'm going to hit that and go (boom) fail both of them so they take 19 damage they're knocked prone and the water extinguishes all unprotected flames like a fog cloud partial cover so it works both ways i can feel the chat saying thanks keyleth i can feel it yeah no wait i'm going to take my bonus action to go water elemental and then i can still move right can i then move my water elemental into this guy's space and as part of my elemental form i can move into spaces that are within an inch can i enter a hostile creature's space it goes (splat) they're actually fine they were on the box and your new dice box morning traffic percy's like (groaning) ugh no i'm still a fire hydrant keyleth is on fire marshal duty i do some misting like at six flags to cool off vex yeah mainly just to make vex sexy that's really all i'm going for i turned into an elemental i've got to do something with it i drop water elemental form you think it needs to be hot first i look up i line up the apparatus and look across the room does it feel like there's any other indiana jones-- i think so too just to test yeah i'm going to do burning hands how quickly do they catch are there any inlays okay it's not my strong point goddamn it that's like the fourth three i've rolled today better 12 platinum is for the trammels is that also a three maybe the platinum is only for the trammels not the key what is the metal can we do a check to see what kind of metal it is what it's made out of wait i want to prep something hide i'll hug the wall closest to the door it's nick cage at his most mediocre i can do a peek 24 the humanoid figure doesn't seem to have noticed us he's not moving i convey what i see i think you might have a guardian you have to fight over that hammer grog if we can take 60 seconds i back up into a corner and start casting conjure elemental and conjure another water elemental to be on our side from the staff maybe he's the guy who tried to use the anvil before hang on we might want to be careful about getting too high there's a lot of smoke in there we don't want to suffocate we're live on the fucking internet sam riegel i stealthily get his attention by waving my hand in his face before we start how long has it been since we entered this chamber entered into the volcano yeah entered into the first forge room i'm trying to find out if freedom of movement is still on can i only have one condition effect on him or can i stack them up okay freedom of movement is not i'm going to cast freedom of movement on you again and then i think enhance ability is though so i'm going to use my concentration to give you cat's grace right you were using dexterity for the smelting then i'll give you cat's grace you have advantage on dex checks i'll take up the rears with my water elemental are they runes or a language is it a script yeah so next after the edge is decapitation scanlan can you read the arcane runes on his sword do you know what this enchantment is can i help him i was just going to say i'm going to come into the room a little bit is his eyesight still trained on grog i'm going to send my water elemental forward and see if it attracts its attention since it's not a mortal towards the anvil yeah but didn't grog train to the right does the water elemental seem to be catching its attention at all or is it still looking at grog can i move the elemental to the left to see if it follows the elemental that's what i'm wondering but what if the pistons are fueling the fires the forge also i've been flooded with tweets on where i got this shirt you were wearing it yesterday the amazing whitney moore made it although we do have a few shirts that we share and trade off for human peoples i just tweeted it out yeah okay i'm also rolling for my elemental 11 for my elemental 11 for my elemental six well you stole the boots attack roll or saving throw it immediately catches your butt on fire because we're surrounded by methane gas you take four damage and you're on fire yeah well he has a head you can have a face and not a head travis and did you custom mess with this figure you did didn't you wait okay it's going to move over to him and he's bigger than large so he's going to do a multiattack he's going to do two slam attacks plus seven to hit (groans) one's a natural one the other's a natural 18 so one hits 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage 18 plus seven they're two bludgeoning attacks it just says bludgeoning damage and he doesn't seem to be distracted or give two shits about him okay cool yeah you know i'll keep him on standby in case people catch on fire what did you find out okay i'm going to do 9th-level shapechange and take a cue from scanlan and turn into a planetar yes i can with shapechange right it is a challenge rating that i can do right planetars okay that's fine doing much right can't dissipate him or anything not really dooty okay i'm going to go up to grog and do healing-- (groans) so i can't do anything else i was going to say can i at least go up to him and grab onto grog's loincloth to make sure his ass doesn't tumble into the lava yeah please don't fucking fall in lava so he's blind yeah spellcasting's a bitch we can make this work i lost control of my elemental no yeah he really has we need to rest you also still have freedom of movement on you you don't have anything else at all i got lost concentration but you do have freedom of movement can he attack the elemental that's now rogue across from him he is slowly steaming away right because it's so hot it's 2d8 plus four now people know why i don't conjure that many elementals i'm going to go fly away since grog is now fine

chain able to where i can pull to at least make it reach grog or no can i fly grog up dog-paddling oh shit we're so tapped out can grog and them let go is it going to slam shut and now i can do my concentration let me burn another spell i'm doing cat's grace on you that fell to the wayside before yeah so we don't waste that platinum that we melted into triangles do you need water i go over and cast create water because you didn't use it before can i do anything to help him can i give him guidance but it would get rid of his cat's grace but you're not using it it's a cantrip i'm going to give you guidance i'm doing it guidance come on grog come on that's my guidance good you still have guidance cat's grace do you want advantage or do you want that extra d4 pick one i can guide you i can do nothing else oh it's dexterity still then keep the advantage you have advantage what do you-- like a rock hammer your coffee-stained artifacts do you want any guidance is it a dex check okay then i will give you cat's grace at third level because my 2nd-level spells are tapped and so are now my 3rd-level spells nothing more (groan) (groans) no one has any other type of guidance or anything this is so stressful so gencon we're going to start with trying to get out of an active volcano and i technically have one 7th-level spell so if we want to go into the mansion and then i can plane shift us home we can do that or wherever we want plane shift and then long rest i will be burning my 7th-level spell at the top of the day instead of at the end well no i can only plane shift us on this plane by basically hacking the spell because the mansion is another plane of existence so i can't plane shift us on this plane i have to plane to another plane
