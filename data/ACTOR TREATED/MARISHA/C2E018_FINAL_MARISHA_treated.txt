then that's it that's my turn i'm going to stay there he has potentially three rounds until he dies you don't have healing word or anything anymore i'm watching people get squashed in front of me freaking kill box that's my thing molly he's looking at nott pretty hard okay beau is going to run and flank with nott over here onto also the northwest side i have to be on the opposite side no i want to go in front of him where i can get his attention the northwest side yeah i'm going to point at his dick and i'm going to go tiny thing then for my action i'm going to take the dodge action huh yeah i say tiny thing you tiny thing to insult his penis size okay well it's a natural one well the second one was a one first one was an eight neither were good so i didn't get his attention no i'm sorry i should have been more explicit about his insulting his penis size shit huh do we win fuck you did good sandman me and you take the head maybe we can-- yasha and i are going to flank his head yeah we want to both try and get him in the head that's what i'm saying we flank his head sorry i used poor language we're both by his head okay i look at yasha and i'll go down first right after me okay ready i'm going to aim right for his other eye socket the other one that nott hit and come down right in the middle try and gore his head out please don't fuck up on a sleeping guy 14 and 15 okay oh god it's a one plus four so six damage that sucks i take my bonus action and three stooges style go poke right in his eye that's a natural 18 okay let me see if i get that crit no 18 though god a one again five damage lot of crappy damage rolls i thought you said who's going to attack first we were going to goodfellas it we were going to do that can i then move and try and jump over him so i then flank him with yasha can i use my movement to get to the other side okay they did i liked how the archer was walking around ready all the time maybe we should do that yeah guys i feel like we got the better end of the deal on this draw kind of glad i'm not fighting this thing we should rip off these guys' aesthetic completely yeah formations are cool knock down the shoes really he doesn't catch nuance though so good to know for next time is there free booze all right beau oh shit they look familiar come on let's go make asses out of ourselves names information where are they going to fight are they going to roll out people what was that about making promises me and yasha are going to go talk to the wizards it's okay fjord's been teaching me how to talk to people sure i walk up to orenid hass oremid i grab yasha behind on the small of her back i walk her up to the window and i'm like yeah and there's actually a really great view-- right it's such a great view over there is the cobalt soul we were i recognize you too i feel like we've met before maybe at a gala previously beau trent ikithon majestic is my middle name we saw the other day you guys fighting off those invaders

go through me because i'm her booker that's actually a conversation that me and you and the rest of the mighty nein can have no i am cobalt soul yeah super proud of the work we're doing over there everyone at the cobalt soul feels the same about you all at the halls of erudition thank you one last question oremid the cobalt soul's been talking about moving to the front line do you have any idea if we're going to get the same support from the hall of erudition because i know you're a fan of our work and we're such a mutual fan of yours beautiful cobalt soul's got your back too rexxentrum soltryce academy oh my god he's got a weakness let's remember this for later man yasha's super honest super forthcoming i don't think so you definitely made it seem like she could be a xhorhasian spy definitely there to potentially kill them in fact i think that's exactly what they thought might have been happening yeah it was kind of great i think they're going to look at you as a good resource i think that's what you revealed yourself as what the fuck is the kryn though oh the kryn i was envisioning a big evil monster have you seen the dark skies i think molly's right i think molly and nott are right i think they're going to try and start enlisting soldiers here are they doing the same where you're from where do we go yes i drink all the leftover drinks that people left behind no i'm just finishing the ones that are left behind it is an atrocity to leave alcohol on a table 17 probably you're a-- you-- see that's even shiftier we have fucking money to burn oh my god i'm so tired pillow trove we're at a break and thank you paul for getting us all ice cream yeah i told you a fucking secret though i also kind of told yasha the secret you and yasha know the secret it's not really that much of a secret yeah as long as nothing crazy happens i'm assuming i know i know exactly what you want to do yeah should be all right what are you looking for just more spells or anything else in particular okay they're not going to let you see the super secretive weird shit in the back yeah there's tons of history man they forced history down my throat hey wait though i know real good at it why are you afraid of fire i'm just saying i just want to know because i'm going to be taking you around books and your relationship with fire is you know no are you going to set the books on fire i'll take you in the library if you tell me why you're afraid of fire one secret traded for another it's a fair price i think do you know where to find me when you're ready i'll take you to the library as soon as i get my payment drinks inside the hotel has drinks well it's a little unbalanced i have to choose if i'm going to commit to the handle or if i'm going to commit to the cup this is not bad she's an instagram model however many can bunk together i guess yeah here's four more for me bottle service jester does that too lend an ear give advice ease your mind just saying that's how it sounded before too is there like a-- never mind like the public libraries of today yes i want my pencil set it felt like a festival inside your school support 826la thank you to those who did ooh that's what i was going to say wow you made an incredibly excellent point it is so easy to defraud the mail it's a lot to send somebody in a birthday card jester why don't you keep that we just kicked ass and made 200 we'll do it again tomorrow sure the emergency fund sure yeah is it the four ladies in a room i rolled a 16 plus-- oh 19 man in context that was weird as fuck i rolled a 19 i poke my head out do i see fjord psst you're in the most expensive hotel in 100 miles and you're in the hallway that's real fucking funny you want to come in our room so you're not in the hall i have nott and jester and jester has pastries we could order room service you want to come in and order room service let's do that we order room service i kind of like it i don't know like you hit someone-- sam and yeah that's great i'm kind of into it yeah you have to unpack in the moment yeah i mean yeah how about this we'll tell them to give us the chef's choice the special oh god come on let's go we're spending enough money on this place okay can we go order food first then we'll go hit caleb because it's going to be like 45-60 minutes to deliver it (knocking) yeah oh i mean-- no but i'm not in favor of many things i don't like a lot of things kind of have a problem with authority and they're like the epitome of authority i watched my father sacrifice a lot to try and impress those people i'm not sure what it was for seems like a lot what how do you mean i'm not super invested in the political spectrum i just don't want any part of it so no i think it could be better no no marisha's telling you beau is being genuine i think-- i have no investment in their success or failure i think most of them tend to be scumbags who want monetary and influential gain and i think they treat their poor pretty shitty and they treat their elite pretty great and i think that's sucky yeah i think they're garbage people but molly thinks i'm a garbage person-- sorry a trash person if they're garbage people i'm their rare cousin the trash person yeah yeah i-- i watched my father sacrifice a lot to get where he was and i'm not sure if it was fucking worth it so the empire doesn't lean favorably in my spectrum but i also don't care if they really live or die or whatever yeah yeah is the secret that valuable what's young teenager why didn't you say anything earlier when we were talking to trent you know we were talking to trent one of the other students he made you executioners caleb that's deeply fucked up you know that right then one day your parents are brought in as traitors no you had to do this to graduate to prove your loyalty into hearing their talks against the empire is that what it was like to run again you were just talking with nott about running tomorrow if i don't let you in caleb i'm good at keeping secrets you heard us talking to trent you know he wants yasha and you're the only person who knows the atrocities that this man-- who utterly gave me the creeps by the way so i'm feeling a little bit validated in the fact that i read him pretty well-- i'm just saying you have a responsibility now keep this guy from hurting more people you want to take down trent is that why you're doing all this you want to take down trent ah what are you hoping to find caleb you don't though no one wants that amount of power and responsibility don't worry i'll take you to the library there are two options here you can selfishly try and go after this guy for your own vendetta or you can use your motives to keep others from getting hurt in a very similar way all right i know you just make dancing lights-- or at least you can feel like you just make dancing lights-- but those dancing lights make sure i can punch people in the fucking face whenever i can't see shit a little bit of teamwork goes a long way cool man cool kick me out of the room i get it yep all right no i mean you just dumped some heavy-ass shit like that and then ask me to leave no i get it it's fine all right i'll leave no i'll keep your secret we'll keep all this a secret i don't think it's anything to be ashamed of though we'll figure it out in time caleb (clicks) nott i have a charcuterie board coming to the girls' room if anybody wants any huh i just ordered another fruit platter but long may he reign huzzah 60 minutes where are we going before our errands or

know how to adjust in certain circumstances though right you do know how to improv based on the current surroundings though right yeah let's go i do spreading that cobalt love that's your name memberships he's a magic fan little heavy-handed man like really heavy-handed i said you were already being too heavy-handed hey madeer how's it been how's it going fucking zeenoth am i right no he's

they want someone really important dead is what it sounds like to me oh should have done that like a week ago good call yeah is joining the city joining the war is that what they made it sound like the city's a part of the empire i think we'll make gold wherever we go check by the merchants' guild see our options and then make the decision from there all right this means we're staying together though we do make such good roommates i think we make a good team i think there's more to be had here it might run out who knows i'm not an optimist but think there's still more to be had merchants' guild then polite exit oh that's right our horsies laura and does she have any badass weapons any badass sticks are we checking the merchants' to see if there's any armed escort requests out of the merchants' guild mutually so you want to hire more legionnaires to go kill an ex-legionnaire who wasn't legionnaire-y enough for you right right now i rolled a seven plus three wait right plus three
