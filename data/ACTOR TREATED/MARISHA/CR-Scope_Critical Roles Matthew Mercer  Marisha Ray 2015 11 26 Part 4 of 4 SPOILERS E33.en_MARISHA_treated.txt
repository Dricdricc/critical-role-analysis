(laughs) man i don't know why we keep trying really hard we're trying so hard man to make this work trying so hard all right guys this is going to be our last attempt so if this fails just know that we love you and we tried and we wish you a happy thanksgiving yeah service is quite spotty and we're slowly leaving civilization even more as we speak and we lose signal but yes happy thanksgiving and we can't wait-- it's weird that tomorrow's thursday and there's no game it's become so ingrained into our system although in a weird way it's almost like this week time has been different i feel like normally the weeks feel so long getting to thursday but now i think because i was anticipating it being a two-week break i feel like this is more of a-- this feels like a halfway point i don't know it's weird to describe but yes you concur it's good it's weird we miss it yeah i think they are doing a rebroadcast tomorrow actually so if you guys want to catch up on critical role or have nothing better to do or-- does football still happen on thanksgiving day if you don't want to watch football you can watch critical role which would be kind of a-- what well i don't know never mind three games yes there's a lot of football happening tomorrow there's always football how about that comic this week you guys how about that comic that came out today am i right i am so in love with it i'm not going to lie out of all the ones that taliesin and i have written for this arc that are coming up this one i was the most excited for and she did not disappoint this is definitely one of my favorite ones that we came up with and she did a really good job on it i was happy with it i was happy with it i know i know that the comic is really short but we are making do with the budget that we got so that is what we were able to get approved in advance the time and-- that's why we've been pushing people so hard to go look at it because as long as people go look at the comic we can possibly get more comic yeah the reason why it's so short is because that's what we've got to work with right now yeah for the people who are asking go to geekandsundrycom and we now have a weekly critical role/vox machina comic strip definitely go check it out yeah a comic strip like family ties or marmaduke wait what did i say family circus is what i meant (laughs) yeah exactly people are saying someone said you voiced chrom in fire emblem they said i thought that was crispin yeah crispin's everyone else but he's chrom aw i have a bird sitter for dagon don't worry dagon's one not in the car and two not abandoned or left alone dagon gets carsick yeah birds get carsick i don't know if you guys know that but birds get carsick you wouldn't think but birds get carsick their little equilibrium in their brain they do not like the driving it gets weird for them it's interesting we have to make it dark and i have to be a shock system and be like don't look outside people who get sea sickness it's kind of like that don't look at the horizon you'll know you're driving and then you'll get sick yeah retool yeah he was saying blood hunter by the way for anyone blood hunter not void hunter or demon hunter blood hunter word i wasn't looking at questions because i was trying to get good camera angles of your face that's not true someone else had a good question right before and i was like ooh that's a good question i'm going to have to remember that one and then i forgot about it i don't know if you had a good question just ask it again person who had a good question yeah ooh that's actually a good question advice for making a tiefling cleric generally really there's no wrong answers people need to just know that when building a character there's no wrong answers as long as you're able to justify it i really like what taliesin had to say about it in his interview that he did the written interviews that we did on geek & sundry he said his method for making characters is he always tries to make someone he'd want to hang out with because especially if you're starting a long-running campaign you are going to be with this person for a very long time so make someone you'd want to hang out with i think that's a really good tip oh i have a lot of friends who are assholes right scanlan is kind of a scummy douchebag but-- he's a loveable scummy douchebag yeah everyone has their vices that you know of that you know of totally yeah druid second place druid second place to who nobody that's what i say what what those are fighting words once again guys i apologize if we lose service we're driving in the desert i'm looking at my phone for service so if we lose service here soon happy thanksgiving and we love you guys so much and we'll be back soonish what's the deal for this month's critmas it's happening on not this next episode but the episode after but we're pushing it this week because first thursday of the month is next thursday christmas be looking out for the website because i'm going to be putting out a critter's guide for critmas here very soon so yes to help guide people because we've gotten a lot of questions on what to do and what to get one of the things that's going to be talked about a lot in there is all of the charities that we all really like supporting because as much as we like stuff we really like it when people give to other charities especially give to people in our name people have been doing that more and more and we really like that someone adopted a bear and then we recently-- we haven't talked about it on-stream yet but we got somebody who donated a bunch of seeds in our name bought seeds for farmers it's a charity a non-profit organization that buys seeds and crops for farmers who might have lost their crops for the year due to drought or plant disease or extreme weather or anything that can happen to these poor farmers that can completely ruin their year if they lose their entire crop so this is an organization that will donate fresh crops and fresh seeds to farmers who might have lost their crops coming from a farming family-- and a druid that definitely speaks to me because i know how much that sucks and i know what it's like when your family-- --loses-- yes due to blight exactly it's awful when you lose your crops due to blight and the poor farmers in our country-- poor farmers everywhere are not appreciated enough look at whitestone yeah especially considering that farmers keep us alive so farmers are awesome stuff like that is a great cause to donate to that we always appreciate oh that's awesome tuk said there's somebody-- a local charity that buys christmas trees for families correct me if i'm wrong on that the chat just went really fast that's really rad yeah i like that we've really enjoyed giving back to 826 and all that stuff has been so rewarding all the extra life campaign going and visiting the children's hospital is amazing it's been so great to actually give back in a way that-- you sometimes feel like you don't necessarily have the power to all the time in your day to day life so this-- that's what it was that's what the person was saying earlier the really good question that i remembered oh god kit buss and rat queens because that is public because someone brought that up in the announcements speaking of this whole crazy escapade doing amazing things for people yeah kit got contacted by kurtis wiebe who is the writer and creator of rat queens whom i know you guys have laura and all the rest of us talk about it on the show all the time kit is actually going to be doing the art for a rat queens webcomic which is fucking awesome and amazing yeah i'm so glad because she's earned it beyond earned it and all because of critical role it's crazy because of our dumb d&d game that connection happened because-- yeah it's awesome yay for kit's fake accent i know maybe one day she'll learn how to do a proper british accent like liam maybe or you yeah
