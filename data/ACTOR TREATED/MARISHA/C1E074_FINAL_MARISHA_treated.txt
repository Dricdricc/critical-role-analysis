oh yeah we did those awesome playlists like a year ago and if you didn't know by the way we did playlists about a year ago each one of us for our characters you should go and check them out they are deep somewhere in the geek and sundry website our spotify playlists they were really good yeah they actually give a lot of insight if you pay attention so yeah go look at our playlists because we are going to be doing a round two starting next week because it has been like 50 some odd episodes and a lot of shit has happened and jello yes yay it's fun oh no he hazes us man yeah what if we get an airship and put the ziggurat inside of it i feel we need to scout the location first let me scry then we will bamf through a tree sound good no we have to go yes i can scry yeah i got my scry ball i am-- do we know someone in fort daxio well reginald is dead this was after the goliaths do we not know anybody at fort daxio okay hang on wait is fort daxio near syngorn are there any guards from emon here because the guards were also the guards from emon went to syngorn so maybe someone in one of the guards knows one of the guards in fort daxio yeah is there an easier way to go about this i am going to go and see if i can find one of the whitestone guards oh i am not good at these i think that it's a 12 let me double check my investigation i don't do this a whole lot yeah 12 so they're more militant or like the army you don't have any army friends are there any army friends here where where point me (shouting) all right i go that way guys this sucks we don't know anyone in daxio all right if gilmore doesn't know anybody then we are going to the nearest location and then we're hoofing it all right let's go talk to gilmore i mean we don't necessarily need to know anybody if you happen to know a very fast way to get to daxio yeah yeah all right back to allura trip three times all right are you fine doing that i can get us back yeah that's kind of a dick what's a shit-ball well actually that's a good point whose fort is this so this is emon's military not syngorn's well yeah if this is for emon then it's for emon do we have any idea on who we're talking to i imagine a kid with a kazoo (laughter) horn noises stocked you said we saw 40 thordak is changing the entire landscape to be very similar to the fire plane all of syngorn actually how is the land around the fort do you have any farm land currently it takes eight hours but it seems like we might have to do some field trips anyway forgive us we've just been through a lot elle i reach in and i pull out one of the teeth and throw it on the table did you see that thanks guys what's unconsciousness (nervous laughter) we noticed a few of the trebuchets when we walked in how many of those do you have percy oh we can get started right now what time is it here just creating farmland all over the world yeah like a well can i get someone to take me to a courtyard or something like that can i do some sort of druidy soil test ph test or something like that see if i can grow stuff here with a plant growth spell just a nature check 15 can i not fix that with a plant growth spell does plant growth fix that all plants in a half-mile radius-- i can plane shift us there after we sleep and i learn it the next morning i could take us straight there yeah can i figure out if the ground is sturdy enough if i start digging little bunkers that would be okay underground bunkers for hiding from a flaming dragon breath westruun we did the bunkers i did a bunker under the sun tree kind of it's like that fallout minigame that they came out with the app basically that question legi-- logi-- (fumbling words) logistical question that's the word i was looking for stuff and things things and stuff they are low on meat because they're low on animals could i do a conjure woodland beings and conjure a bunch of deer and then we could play shooting range oh right they disappear oh that's mean no i don't do that by the way i was asking ahead of time because that would be mean never mind are you trying to think of bringing back supplies just to scout it out i guess i can start on the underground bunker for tonight i guess should i do it on the inside in the courtyard make an underground pod think fallout i imagine closer to the fortress right on the inside i imagine we wouldn't want to go underneath the wall yes yeah mm-hmm could i theoretically open a tree and send people in no not to the feywild if we need to see someone to-- yeah or marquet or wherever are you kidding i don't know it could be any minute now they've been spying on us this whole time what makes you think it will take a few days all right well how do we know that thordak will even come here by the way he has no reason to come here unless he's deliberately looking for us which we have no reason to believe that he cares to come find us we've got that thing-- i could ask potentially my father and the air ashari i'd have a hard time asking the fire ashari there's so few of them we also have a 2000 person capacity here i mean we can always push it and make encampments on the outside but what's our ideal number we're trying to hit allura do you have some way of messaging people and sending messages like super quickly fassbender he's with wilhand across the planes that would be great and me two seventh-level spells it'll take me a 7th-level spell to get there and then i'll have to burn my 8th-level spell to get back bigger allies i don't think she knows anyone westruun was decimated theoretically i was going to say what about tooma who's the dragonborn in vasselheim tofor do you know tofor is the person at the slayer's take vanessa have you ever met my father korren of the air ashari yeah no you're great ukurat and you think that we're going to find those in the fire plane peanuts you don't know if it's going to be one day i'm not like a wonka-vator man we have no way to contact her some of us can go and some of us can stay what makes you think that he would lead the charge to come find us in his eyes he could just send one of his peons to come smash us yeah if we tell thordak where we are he'll probably come with that wyvern army that almost took out whitestone correct while he's gone and the other thing that we could glean from the fire realm is possibly figuring out a little bit more about the connection he had with it and to the heart stone ember seed thing i'd like to bring raishan with us to the fire plane she knows it better than anybody else my gosh you guys the dawn martyr is in the city of brass which i'm pretty sure is overrun with fire elementals i mean we can go we can hit the fire ashari first and see if cerkonos is there and maybe see if cerkonos wants to help us out allura you're certain as soon as he finds out about vorugal's death that he's going to seek retribution do you think he went to the place which shall not be named because raishan tipped him off that we were there travis and why did he go to the place that shall not be named then why did he look there you think they were just scanning we can always come back and i would like to maybe see if we could find out more about the ember seed fire plane oh boy nope well okay if we are-- liam and hang on do we want to stop off at the fire ashari and pick up cerkonos i think it's not a bad idea we are not going to bring along our ally who knows the fire plane better than anyone alive once i tree stride we can there's that portal there and we can go through the portal the tour guide all right we're going to tree stride to the fire ashari across the ravine well how big was the ravine like crossing the grand canyon it has to be to another plane (groans) rip the carpet there's still kids like two kids one of those days they might grow up (nervous laughter) come on kids have a sword yeah i knew he'd be all right cerkonos thordak has taken over emon and in the time that he has broken out of the fire plane it seems there is a certain magic that is allowing him to essentially turn emon into a second fire plane we believe he still has some sort of connection here based on the binding magic that was used on him in the past something called an ember seed have you heard of this do you remember if raishan when she was moving in and out of the fire plane do you remember her mentioning anything about it or anything suspicious about wanting to learn about the connection to the fire plane where is the cinder grove did we pass through the cinder grove it was opened more the portal got weak when it was around the solstice we fought cerkonos who was essentially a giant elemental i don't remember us breaking anything yeah i got a little panicky at one point yeah thordak was connected by the soul gem and we know he busted through you know the fire plane better than anyone we are also looking for the plate of dawnmartyr in the city of brass how long is the journey to the city of brass right here's the worst-case scenario though we're gone we come back thordak has obliterated everything including fort daxio do you think you could reach out to korren well if you don't want to go inside i can plane shift us there we don't necessarily need you i guess i mean we need you but i'm wondering if you'd be better here do you know anything of where thordak was held is there anyone here left that raishan spoke to the most a confidant someone who might have been aiding her well that's fair let's do this shit cool let's go city of brass yo shit a lot came in at the eleventh hour too so if you didn't see yours in the slideshow-- we still probably saw but that would be why yeah she got like real close i'm going to go with woodson schindler aka @criticalcorrupt for his manleth he did a bearded keyleth oh yeah it was legit and his eyeshadow was on point i just want to say so @criticalcorrupt you're awesome overall winners that was so well done he was like oh she did way better than i did we have to go to a commercial break stay tuned we're going to raid our closets hook you guys up i'm going to go ahead and cast protection from energy on myself with fire we have to i think be in a fairly safe space and give me a minute let me double check before i say that nope i lied it's instantaneous me and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle laura ashley and yeah what's our code word 25 25 the efreetis you don't think the day when we were cows was far weirder that was pretty weird can i recognize it as a druid who has spent time as a fire elemental no we have to-- hang on let's do a quick refresher on the impossible needle we have to find in this haystack hang on hold i brought that spell as well it has to be within 1000 feet 1000 feet isn't a whole lot in this really large metropolis correct so wait there's a beacon of protection for the chosen of pelor it is gathering dust on a wall somewhere in the city of brass it was a trophy won by a fire giant in a card game from the suutan bloodline that once donned it it could be hanging on a pub wall somewhere correct do we know where fire giants might hang out or anything about the suutan bloodline i mean it could be in a noble's house for all we know yeah everyone wants to kick our ass do i get advantage because of the fire resist do i have to roll or am i good to go i meant to note i wanted to put my ring of protection on and put the cloak away when we took that short rest i don't know if i said that out loud can i do that now and it takes some time hang on how long does that spell last grog could you recognize fire giants if you saw one are they akin to stone giants and you're like that's a fire giant all right yeah totally i'm going to talk to vex as soon as we get a hot second whenever that falls all right so we both have the locate object spell it lasts for ten minutes and we can both fly we could both cast it and maybe do like a perimeter run maybe yeah if we're flying well i could also potentially polymorph into something or beast shape into something that-- has there been any type of creatures okay are they considered humanoid-ish to where i could alter self to look like an efreeti teeny teeny efreeti no are there any humanoids like like-- or like dragonborn or like what's the thing that zahra is i'm drawing a blank right now tieflings are there like any tieflings around i want to look for the most unsubjugated humanoids yeah kind of the same thing oh shit yes that's really bad that's the gil dice 15 (whispering) a phoenix so they have birdies no i stop and turn around and wait for them to catch up we'll meet you at the axe-throwing just go ahead liam taliesin and i light up my flame hand and i turn to one of the efreeti and i go fist bump pound it man pound it what did you want persuasion ten man we've been here five minutes i'm going to keep pace with grog you're probably making it worse do the efreeti react to them vanishing it's all bad ideas in dungeons & dragons it's really true sometimes you get lucky with a bad idea you busting out the hand cone all right am i standing by scanlan are they in front of us now oh i don't want to do something i'm really bad at which is talking to people i have ideas okay is this what i want to do i'm going to do alter self and i'm going to change myself into a tiefling and then i-- oh god this is really terrible oh my god i am really bad at deception-- i'm going to turn around and say i'm sorry there seems to be a miscommunication these are my slaves they are already owned and my property release them immediately you know i don't have a lot to go off of except for zahra and that one that was in front of us so i'm going to do zahra like a red you know a red with like devilly horns definitely give it a tail i want to look intimidating i want to look like you wouldn't want to meet me in a back alley but that's where we are a bad bitch matt and it's just a straight roll oh god oh jesus christ nine a saving throw oh that was almost so good that was almost great 13 run i want to go catch up with them yeah do these alleyways connect does it block around is this dark i lift my hand and i light it up to give us a little bit of light aw grog it's a very small room what caught your attention on us aside from the utter look of pathetic-ness were you once in chains that's ominous can i do an insight check does that mean he murdered a lot of fricking people let's go druid dice oh god ooh it's an 18 what was it insight right 29 which one was the tiefling and which one was him senokir is the humanoid who is something's off about him uten how long have the two of you been in business together so unprepared does the name thordak ring a bell the cinder king it's a pseudonym maybe thordak has escaped into our realm-- all right that's what we want as well it used to belong to the suutan bloodline yes it was won by a fire giant he said in accent a few of us could look like you to keep all of us out of chains maybe a few exceptions i can look like one of them very simply i think we'd all feel a little bit comfortable if some of us were free i study him and i change to like a-- i don't have to talk i just have to look like someone else that's not that hard i change myself to look like one of him i'm like eh eh passable (slowly) do all of you talk like this do i also need to talk like this never mind
