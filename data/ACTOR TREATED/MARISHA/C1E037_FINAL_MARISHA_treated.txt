ashley when did you get here i lived in mine over the holiday very soft they're so comfy and we found out your parents watch we had no idea your parents watched i think this is also technically yours too yeah we put expansion pack spell cards in there that we can all use and new art oh i haven't seen that one yet i've got body paint ashy body paint well we have all that awesome proof right i feel like they'll see that as a conflict of interest yennen yevon yennen make sure that they notarize it and all that good stuff depends on what we want well he said it would take a year and you'd need to have allura work on that to be fair she was just using it as a rug right they were eaten by harpies there's no teleportation circles is there i can yeah actually long as we all jump within six seconds home to our keep but it's coming it's on the way i have a 6th-level spell called teleportation via plants where as long as i've seen the tree before we can walk through the tree laura and that's true wasn't allura on her way the emperor dude theoretically they were trying to keep allura from us anyway so it's not like she can help us in emon right so we can go home taliesin marisha and let's hop in a tree what well we technically already have a letter coming and we'll have a letter in hand right yeah i hope our keep's still there to see our keep to make sure it's not on fire that's not a bad idea let's do it you guys want some pancakes and bacon the bear will probably be able to come with us sorry he can fit through the sun tree right let's use the sun tree i say hey boo i'll see you soon you be good you take care of you man this is the best tree of all time are these cartoon physics jump why are you sleeping outside you have a bed upstairs how long have you been here so many questions we literally kicked it for a weekend and went to a festival we could've come back yeah thanks to you (excited stammering) did you feel our bag of dicks that we did were you aware of our bag of holy light dicks that was an out-of-context thing me and you teamed up and we killed lady briarwood by-- well i didn't know how aware you were because your connection was fuzzy that was awesome i read it in a book laura and aw someone's going through our shit i will bye tibsy i give him a hug yes how did that work just curious because he was kind of a test run oh good good that's what i was going for sure awesome right remember we were going to let him stay him the guest room but he was like i'm going to stay-- well i mean i'll find it it's in my old notebook what's today what day is it yeah there's days of the week she didn't go downstairs that's mean that's mean how much coin did we pull out of the treasury of whitestone you got a 20 maybe we can just hand over the bloody bag of gold to desmond we have our who has our papers bust out the mustache you think he would go that far tofor what was her last name so this is essentially our jury judge judgment party yeah sorry fort daxio don't forget the mustard don't spend it all in one place bruh watch the flask yeah you know i'm wondering if i was a sneaky bastard-- thank you so much i sometimes get concerned if i was a sneaky bastard and i wanted to make sure-- thank you and if i were to make sure (laughs) i had an emergency escape route outside of the city and was maybe tasked to build i don't know say our keep within the last year i feel like we need to start at home here because our keep is butted up against the border of the city and everywhere else yeah can we get them no i think he escaped through our keep yeah can we ask for transparency and information exchange or something like that with these people so that we can come in and out of the cloudtop district are we cool there okay cool so here's my other question the briarwoods wanted something with emon that had nothing to do with building a bridge right what did they want was like a ruse so the briarwoods coming to emon is assumed to be just a formality that's all they were here for but why send-- why would i go why would you go why not send a representative you know what i mean well you know what they say when you asum (weak laughter) i can't do the arcane thing do we have any idea when the letters came in to emon that we were successful either or when did they get them do we know can we find that information yes that one and it's been about three days since they've seen riskel can i go outside i wanna do a-- no outside dirt i want dirt under me i'll be right back i'll be right back i'm not gonna i'll be right back i just like the bushes better well i'm out in the courtyard i want to do a commune with nature spell is riskel anywhere in town can i take my second question to focus a little harder and figure out where in town he is thanks vision fades that's all i got so i get one more question (laughs) what is the meaning of life can i see any type of underground secret tunnels or passageways that lead out of the city what okay cool beans ah what that's funny i found the same thing but i just meditated for a minute you know i'm glad we got things that overlapped though that's good i mean it corroborates exactly cool well i found good news eskil i mean riskel is still in town i'm pretty sure i got-- his essence was floating in nature's ether and nature told me he was here in the graveyard district it seems like he's somewhere-- i saw that-- he's somewhere underground also it looks like there is in fact quite a lot of tunnels and secret passageways that lead out of the city near there so we have been i thought it sounded familiar wait was this the same tavern is this the one that's got like-- right is this the one that's also like a whorehouse is that that one what time is it right now yeah i think they are i think they're eating popcorn i can hear it i was gonna say what does the clientele of the bar look like (laughing) dr dre (laughter) yeah you know we never get to see you play scanlan not to your full capacity i go and i get as many ales as i can carry and start handing them to those guys here have a drink yeah oh shit it's true what's his name insight check 29 i rolled a 19 i get secrets so you're just out of the good of your heart wanting to redistribute a little bit of funds to help out a few less fortunate people that's all you have in this really and where exactly did you find this information on this dickhead you asked him what well if i know anything about your skills scanlan i think it says a lot about dr dranzel so-- you're welcome forgive me if i'm-- yeah i was going to say he was going to go downstairs i'll go with team downstairs so do we think that the clasp is protecting riskel is that what we're assuming i mean you were with these people once what-- 15 yeah hork like you mean it so there are still two cooks in the kitchen it was just one big full album the song was a whole album i can't believe the jethro tull song with no flutes was the one you happened to find plank hold your abs i'm up next oh it is a rainbow sylvan i do do you want an enhancement of your abilities okay you use dexterity right i give him cat's grace i cast enhance ability on him kind of yeah yeah in their language it's pronounced huh-gluf you already popped the top lock and nothing happened right you've got advantage so why not fuck it so wait are there two different directions can i ascertain if there's any type of draft or any-- oh you already tried i definitely would rather not fight the entire thieves' guild sounds to me like you just won twice can i druidcraft a little bit and druidcraft a little bit of breeze seeping from the box sleight of hand oh did you see that that was awesome 21 i say careful do not open that box without the password or else it will melt your eyeballs from inside your head (laughter) 11 you never know it acts in mysterious ways oh shit can i druidcraft a gust coming out of it okay is it the one we got at last winter's crest that one the one that we were using shards of it to carve through dimensions cool i'm going to go ahead and block in the entryway for good measure yeah why not i mean we can get it out so is this leading into something crazy into a labyrinth or just his cell as far as we know just a cell did half-orc dude say he was just in this cell that's all he said is there any other entrances or anything else around fine go for it 14 okay i'm going to peek around grog and try and cast hold person on him 18 just my spell dc right aw no ah yes i just said yes no wait i don't have it i don't have it nope never mind no go he has to make a wisdom saving throw oh is that what he was doing against my spell save is that what it is do it he wanted to take him to the ground that's what i was going to say can we tie him tie him up he's down on the ground i was going to say i can okay yeah i'll go ahead and vine him to-- oh right because it's got to be against a wall can it be the ground yeah can i essentially just entangle him into the ground yeah he's down yeah that's right can i do entangle instead and just do a concentrated entangle i mean i can try and hold person him again do we want to do that i can hold person him again can i do a druidcraft matt a druidcraft where i druidcraft a vine around his ankles oh okay cool a grapevine grapevines are pretty hard i know it'd be a close grip as a fight-- as a staff user that's-- you know what bring it bitch 'sup miss 17 is exactly what he needed 15 yeah uh-huh is this all for that staff comment uh-huh (laughs) i just go to my earpiece and i go thank you percy fucking dick he deserves it yeah keyleth gets up and bleeding from my mouth and i just take him and i grab him by his face and i just say fucking traitor and i spit a big glob of blood in his face it's true (laughs) oh that's very good the cooks are back in the kitchen yeah i mean what are they gonna do now oh hang on are we about to walk through a very crowded bar playing the long game i like it oh shit forgot yeah scanlan backstory oh popcorn down so next week we're doing critmas next week
