shatter i'm supremely uncomfortable what no but i'm not a leader of these people okay i step forward (chuckles sighs) the bravery of vasselheim remains evident on this day and you all should be proud that your reputation of a city unfallen by invasion or attack remains and that is only because of the faith and the bravery and the strength of the citizens of this amazing city we of vox machina are proud and honored to have fought by every single one of you and we vow to continue to stand by your side through the rest of our days huzzah to 1000 years of vasselheim huzzah yeah 20 hit points now

coffee stains he's really irritable keyleth sits next to vex and lays her head on her shoulder i don't have the strength to argue with him aw that might be the last natural one of this campaign you have to scream it from a mountaintop man betrayal one man's trash yes he taught me how to love and i have a hard time with interpersonal relationships so i would've held onto that one for as long as i could've and i still will as i count you as mine going to have to look out for each other now also fuck that raven bitch what the fuck you're smarter than a sword oh my god you did it oh i'm pretty sure you just handed out an apology after you just said you weren't going to hand out an apology i think percy is a walking contradiction i thought-- wait we-- did you just sitcom mug okay allura (laughter) you were quite an inspiration allura i hope you know you inspired me quite a lot we know a lot about that allura is vasselheim going to be looking for members to join the council totally no right i actually was actually i was thinking pike but i don't know-- maybe they do a dry city after a certain time do you need any type of water or anything we can immediately assist you with do you have somewhere to put it i burn as many create water spells as it takes to fill them up yeah she'll be fine she'll be safe to let him know that his daughter is still alive yeah she's going to have to be introduced at some point hell yeah drunk as shit now's the time kima we're bad influences i see you're working the late shift well we frontloaded our hours which one you bug me about a lot of things yeah and you ask me after i have a bit of alcohol in me and i scry on cassandra looks like she's been tended to like a proper de rolo did i see kaylie and gilmore she was not doing well gilmore was the most able-bodied i'm assuming he got her there i hope i'll scry on the rest of them tomorrow thank you percy you taught me just the right amount of how to be a shithead just enough the most selfless second to you (sighs) it's hard to think after a day that feels like a week like today i've got to get back to zephrah greyskull i don't think i can go back to whitestone with you i have to go back to zephrah bad influences all of you assholes all right one day and then i want to not see your faces for a bit we could go back to whitestone whenever i've still got a little bit of juice left i do believe it or fucking not what oh it was more of a rhetorical-- it's like a trick or treat-- why do we still try to explain things to him i haven't learned we can drunkenly walk there and take our time and enjoy the stars and we can-- oh scanlan-- scanlan we can do little arcane cantrips when no one's looking and break the rules a little bit of vasselheim just cantrips though i know what what i've lost the love of my life today i'm allowed to be belligerent do you have that sandkheg shit i am drunk enough to where i'm not going to stop it or argue against it but i won't partake so that's pretty good for me grog you've had two weapons speak to you-- grog haven't we been through enough shit to know nothing's free fuck it you insult our resolve and hold out on us all at the same time yeah yeah no this one won't work no this won't work sorry sorry next one that one looks good (slurred) see when you travel-- wait no when you travel west to east you gain time see (slurred) happy hour is right now in whitestone just saying okay heading home works cry myself to sleep oh buddy i cover trinket with snot and tears as i sob into his belly first night alone but with trinket aware of the gesture i cry drool and eyeliner and dirt remember i charcoal war-painted wait where are you in the middle of fucking whitestone shut your mouth travis pull good oh please don't bring pit fiends on our heads that can't be good did our internet go (screaming and groaning) you fucking dick you're a fucking dick it is bad you said you weren't going to bring the deck of many things into the game and then you did (mispronouncing) worst fucking timing internet has gone timing worst fucking timing she doesn't get shit she just watches i guess we'll add that to our to do list yeah so grog's body is still there-- catatonic sure it's just an annoyance goddamn it wait we spend two weeks in what i should be mourning right now and i'm hunting your stupid ass down great therapy lesson a healing trip keyleth backhands him with the hand that has the most rings on it of power probably not we can't even see you right now you're a silhouette on the screen but we can hear you it might be a cheap joke how fucked would that be so fucked yeah girl power i think i have the perfect place for this thank you thank you so much i think it's perfect where are we going to put it i think he'd like that something you have to stumble upon it's a little hidden stealthy memorial grog was the reason for this season oh it's 2017 when will we will have better skype oh sam 16 rites of passage that's a lot of names very long names the wonder bear he prevents forest fires (laughter) penny bear (sighs) okay naturally help pike rebuild vasselheim in the most immediate of circumstances eventually retire to zephra go be the actual leader of my people continue to get in any type of frays that these people invite me on as it reminds me of the good old days and keeps my promise to protect this realm any time this realm needs protecting and i find kerrick at some point seek out kerrick make sure he's okay reconnect with him have coffee you know perfect we're weekend buddies we go to wine country and then i work on the propagated sprig from the sun tree and continue to build it out hopefully on the ley lines of the planet and i take the feather that pike gave me from vax and i embed it into the trunk of the tree as well as any other relics from the raven queen i can find care for ravens as much as i can and from the branch of the sun tree create my own raven tree of the ashari take a long long long long long time before i maybe date again maybe but eventually hopefully after a long long long long long time sunset into the tree and become a part of this realm ways off but that's the plan i don't think it's the faces that keep this light from fading i think it is what it is we're lucky to experience it a few are lucky to think it's beautiful you taught me that i don't have to appreciate this especially not after what i've seen but i do only because of what i've seen thank you it's all i ever wanted it's weird once you reach a life goal and then realize you have the rest of your life i guess i just find new goals sometimes it's hard being a prodigy because then you just grow up to be a regular adult thanks dad i love you blow a kiss little scratch oh god i had to get past this emotional chapter so i could get through the next one (laughter) best dm ever we'll be back that was beautiful
