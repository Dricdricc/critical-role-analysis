your balance is probably a little wonky does anyone seem to be paying attention to us so right now they're focused on the chaos of the temple well hang on grog can't be far right no he can only be a thousand feet away they used the spell dimension door that tiberius has well i remember the gods on high telling us last week that we recognized the spell that was used aw man i feel that comes back to bite us in the ass later (nervous laugh) because he is still conscious right i'm going to go ahead and cast pass without a trace on the party that's been a kind die to you 13 you still have plus ten to the roll because pass without a trace 22 no i am exhausted i can't do anything else right now i can make another hallucinatory terrain i can do that still can i make it to where it just looks like a wall i think hallucinatory terrain lasts an hour if i think about it books books where's my book it lasts for 24 hours it's not a concentration spell it just takes a minute to cast and it lasts for 24 hours so i'm going to go ahead and cast it and make it look like there's just a wall with another lava flow that's come out and is starting to happen wait was someone not inside wait here's what i'm afraid of if we sleep we could lose grog's trail he could be nearby right now you are shitting with us right i can use my beast sense that is one more thing i can still do i could theoretically-- we could use trinket but that the only time you can do that right we have to find grog okay theory proposition proposal what if we use your hunter's mark figure out where she is get there camp out nearby tackle it in the morning wait are they in an underground base so we're on the same level as them or are they above us i have a theory i've a new skill that i've recently learned and was practicing a lot when i was with the earth ashari while we were gone for the past six months they taught me the ways of the earth elementals so and as an earth-- but i am still new at it thank you pike thank you i mean i am a little self-conscious about it still but i can travel through the earth it is not a burrowing thing right just me but i could get inside well i am not talking about right now if we do some sort of flanking thing i am wondering if we can make a tunnel though i can theoretically-- okay theoretically we could rest and i could keep all of my spells and use all of my magical focus to tunnel us out depending on how far we are going we can do an underground approach yeah but what if they leave while we sleep okay all right i'm so mad at him why'd he get stolen i could help you with some natural mediciney stuff maybe is there anyway i could assist her possibly that way we can sleep on it i start building a positive chi like a healing chi ball i light some sage is this what i can maybe assist her with we could just own it and call you-- well i was going to say vax the nine-toe we can get you a prosthetic little toe that has a little compartment for poison or a brass claw toe that's fun maybe we could get you a raptor claw that's cool once again are you afraid they're going to take him while we're asleep is this a genuine concern is this something we should move on now are you congratulating us for being murderers is that what you're doing right now are you suggesting now that we control the wills of the deities that's mighty bold and presumptuous of you i do show respect lady kima i show respect when i feel that respect has been earned lady kima i am not saying that what we are doing here is not just i only wish that you understand-- and i humbly thank you for your appreciation and thanks for coming down here to rescue you but you are correct we have lost a friend someone who we have been through a lot with way more than we have been with you so before we start boasting congratulations and you start thanking us why don't you wait and we'll see what happens when we all get out of here first all i'm saying lady kima is that after what we have done and what we have been through and the lives and the blood that even i have on my hands you had better be worth it lady kima i only hope you do not eventually become what you fear so much good night i turn into minxie form and go off in the corner and curl up in the corner we have to pick them for the day right yeah hang on got to think about this i go and cast pass without a trace on us i put stone shape in my ring of holding last night with my unused spells i meant to tell you that last night (softly) stealth check you have plus ten 33 does it look to be natural done by an animal or does it look like people with weapons ten could i do a nature check to see if i would know of a creature that could do this ooh 26 something tentacle-y though nothing ever good is tentacle-y wheel tracks their width is consistent and they seem clean yeah sounds like they have him on yeah a trailer things what so it's like a pebble ball pit in front of us does it look like there-- can i do a nature check to see if this is an old lake bed like there is a river bed i rolled a 16 chunks okay so there appears to be-- are there any whole pieces of bones big femurs or skulls what so we're on the right road no no i'm not touching that nope okay here's my idea we've got that immovable rod i don't want to touch this i feel like we should go over it there's no way to avoid it i mean i could wall of-- bend us a stone wall that's and we could just walk along the path but it goes only so far the side and then we walk along that side yeah we could do that right i can go 120 feet i can make about 120 feet wall maybe we can fashion-- can we fashion snow boots okay sure i use stone shape and i bend down and make a big circle where i am carve out a little cylinder with stone shape disc maybe you could just levitate trinket behind can we make him weightless and then tug him along with the rope we can't do that (gasps) oh we're done we can do this we polymorph trinket we
