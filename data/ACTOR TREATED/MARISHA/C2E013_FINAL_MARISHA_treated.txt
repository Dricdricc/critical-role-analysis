grappled it's literally right here let’s subdue him and talk to him i hate these rides okay i still have him restrained i can't see or do shit still holding onto the rope can i full-on football tackle him and try and push him out of this dark cloud uh-huh oh i'll do that then i'm going to start with the rope wrapped around start like a lifeguard backing out yeah towards fjord i felt fjord go by so i want to try and go towards fjord look what i caught yeah i did help me subdue him i'm going to do another crack to the forehead with my off-handed attack that's a natural one no wait no it is i thought it was a seven thought it might be a seven okay both hit ouchies ow yes please that's great thank you much better ouchies no that's right fjord's turn oh god okay-- i'm going to first try and tighten my grip on him and can i try and bulldoze him down to the ground and pin him to the ground cool i'm going to also try and do non-lethal damage and knock him on the head two attacks yeah first one’s a natural 19 second one is another natural one sorry 1d8 plus four is-- 12 thank you can i take a free action to be like we just want to talk to you damn it still hits nope i don't think he wants to talk to us (strained) oh yeah i've got a-- i can also tie bows in my beau's rope wait you want to put my bo in bows-- boots something three daggers and lots of gold remember when we lost 500 platinum at the bottom of the bag of holding last campaign for months that was funny yes oh that's where i put that we universally forgot it as a team molly do you think this is the weapon from the crime scene that we saw that big glowy black-- see extremely powerful does it look like the same color from the gauntleted hand that we saw in the alley let's wake him up super baity (singing) go ahead and jump by the way last time travis did this i jumped off of a cliff and splatted as a goldfish we could be heroes turn him in invaders in chains that is true these guys were called cricks if anything was true in the porn you can always trust porn to be honest there's always truth to porn this guy is from the dwendalian empire from the julous dominion remember the porn it was a very awkward reading the marrow valley what was-- the army of julous oh conflict between the julous dominion and the dwendalian empire and she was a general for the dwendalian empire she was super in love with this general named theo theo oh he does speak common half-elves did i remember team half-elves did no do you mean rebirth or do you mean reanimate let's be honest here oh jeez is this thing what we saw take out half the zauber spire is it just the two of you or were there more who was your help if it was just the two of you it has to be someone in the city who was it you don't tell us we'll find out one way or another i can tell you that right now you can either help us get there faster or we'll just take the long goddamn way he looks like a good reward to me unless under one condition you tell us who you were working with in here is it kara dolan exactly anything any reactions yeah can me and fjord tag team this yeah let's just each roll we're just going down the list fucking fuck better than me 13 what he hasn't told us shit just leave him he can get out himself he's a smart guy ooh was it the gentleman we could pawn this thing right now it'll be off of our tail in like two minutes what if he comes back and destroys us with this thing in six months two months and super different than five seconds ago when you said we should just let him go does it scare you that much if it's that scary then what do you want to do with it or we can take it now and kill him later just saying it could be like a fun game look i know some people why don't we bag this thing up and we'll take it right over to-- okay i'm not talking about anything-- new plan new plan all right we can't decide if we should leave him or take the thing or take the thing but leave him or kill him or-- why don't we take both him and the thing we go to the cobalt soul drop him off front doorstep leave a note you're welcome and apparently so are we or at least talking about it they hold information they've got a decent amount of relics and spell books and things that they might know and they're technically a little bit separate from the city they're kind of not necessarily a part of the empire they kind of make sure the empire stays in check the dwendalian empire no wait sorry i meant xhorhas right we're letting him leave without the beacon and he's not going to take it (singing) it's in a book reading rainbow i still say we load up both of these guys okay he definitely does not get a secret disguise to help him get through the city just saying it feels like we're leaving an opportunity in the sewer nope should we follow him see where he's going travis and just saying maybe there's some cool portal or something how are they getting in and out man is he heading deeper into the sewers the way the spiders were i don't care about wars between empires i just like having more information for later i should have just strapped him up we had control of it when it was still in our hands we don't have control anymore what did you say you said we're down one what happened to ulog yeah we don't want to be a part of this we were working at the festival we're just trying to get out man i say sir we have coworkers that were working at the festival do you know anything about this attack as we walk i'm going to ask fjord did you catch any weird twitches or any signs that he was lying you know maybe we were assholes for not noticing that him handing over his entire life savings was a little suspicious i don't think we got it which is pretty dope all right let's all be clear that whatever the empire wants they'll fucking take you can disguise yourself you can disguise yourself as crick i'm definitely super injured but this sounds fun they're in an alleyway i'm going to parkour elf get on the-- elf monk get on the roof of the nearest building okay okay okay 16 natural 20 where's nott where are you come on come on come on i follow caleb as he traces around but on the roof i crouch down on the roof above caleb and i go (bird coo) come on caleb trying to avoid the paparazzi i'm on the roofs been tracking caleb this whole time on the roof i drop down in front of the kids batman-style don't take my fucking line before i get a chance to say it close but different motive whatcha buying kids you know that shit will fucking kill you right with advantage jesus a natural one and a four so five i take out my staff and i say do your parents know you're out this late or are you trying to prove something and just for taliesin i say stay in school (laughter) yeah i'm going to stealth and try to track back towards caleb but make sure no one else is also following him i don't think we should go back to the song & supper fjord and i found an additional cellar where we found that skeleton behind the leaky tap doesn't look like anybody-- (announcer voice) thank you for joining us for fantasma the park is now closed (dopey guard voice) it was just like that cat i kicked the other day nott remember that additional cellar behind the leaky tap uh-huh i think that might be safe it was super dead like no one's been there for a super long time super clean bones like at least two years i'd say i think we can wait until morning though how's the city looking are people ransacking are there looters okay it's not that bad break you think the whole damn thing was a fucking distraction i really don't like being used who's at the bar is there anyone at the bar clay owens hey clay how's it going long night i know right can i go ahead and get a double to help with the night had anyone come in tonight any one of the usuals seen ulog seen kara yeah all right you didn't see them rush out with anybody mention where they were going i think he got food poisoning from the finger food at the gala you should never trust that shit all right well thanks clay slam it let's go oh i give him a gold oh i'm sorry i was-- it's just the-- just keep it it's just the stress of the night sorry i'm a little-- maybe next time it's a round on you right okay bye all right let's go no why oh my tolerance is like-- it's at an unhealthy level let's go yeah let's see if those guys are there natural 20 someone's hiding yeah sure make sure they don't try and run nope i'm still out back (whispers) fjord are you dead while all this was going on can i do a quick little casing intelligence to see if there's any thrown-away trash burned evidence or anything in the back fucking-- fuck you gil six did he let me in there's a little town not far from here called alfield it might actually have use for a doctor right about now wait before you guys leave it doesn't matter based on what's just happened is there anything that you guys know that we didn't about any other of the members of the knights of requital that might have a more invested interest in an invasion or getting back at anyone in the zauber spire sorry yes that was the right one seems like you all had your own individual motives for why you were part of the knights of requital you sure yours was just because you wanted to be the high-richter always have someone check your work sounds like half the clubs in la fuck all right i’ll go up and see what they are saying i was just about to say jester’s everyone's little sister when you're a senior in high school why are so many fucking people trying to skip town don't take no for an answer we almost killed a guy and then someone else killed a guy we still reaped all the rewards good for us guys good for us ey represent upstairs yeah convene in-room it's all right yeah it's down feathers all over the place where's caleb he downstairs what's the last thing he said makes sense how much shpizich wait what i thought we just sent him on his way aw fuck i thought-- did you bring me that drink oh sit down sorry i was mentioning alfield but really it's up to him i guess i don't care we walked in on him and his boy trying to skip town well he said he only wanted to be gone a week though right you do know that leaving town itself is suspicious in its own right right just throwing it out there but you have an alibi it's hard to have an alibi when you mysteriously-- i don't give a shit what you-- yeah claudia also skipping town she knew we were holding all those backroom meetings right she helps you guys quite a lot how many platinum 19 and two gold yeah i didn't expect you to wear platforms i look at molly and i take out my bo staff i say parry and i go whack with the sword see if anything happens yeah i mean i told him i was attacking 20 total oh sorry i thought we were just wrestling a little ow fuck do i feel anything yeah a fucking headache do the daggers seem special i'm going to take one of the daggers and i throw it against the windowsill seal damn it that's true what did you say (singing) don't fuck me gil 20 sorry 22 i mean that was pretty awesome right that's true i think what fjord meant was can y'all be trusted very valid question seems like he's taken a few things that he's afraid of wait what happened you do realize that missing things mean leaving a trace right you realize you're not helping your case right we’d already fucked up the rug we probably shouldn't fuck up anyone else's house we were already implicated at one place right are you aware of what stockholm syndrome is yeah yeah it's an emon thing it doesn't matter wait okay hang on before we turn this into a pissing contest-- it's not about earning each other's trust look i have worked with some skeevey motherfuckers in my day very unsavory types but you know what i trust that they have their own self-preservation right so i can trust that these motherfuckers don't want to get caught and that they don't want to die at the end of the day if you want to do something skeevey on the side let me know i will help you out but when we are all working as a team i don't want your actions to get me in fucking trouble we don't have to trust each other but when we are working on a job together i want to know that you care enough about yourself that you're not going to get me in trouble fuck you molly taliesin and i agree with that when you want to grab something for yourself you let me know and you go grab it for yourself i don't have to be a part of it when we choose one objective together i can only trust that you are in it with us we can be selfish as a group and then be selfish as individuals is there you're not the only one who can have the same interests in keeping each other safe oh yeah thanks man super shame that caleb's not here for this entire conversation let's go down there why don't we camp in the cellar i mean not as nice as what they said if he ever does anything to get me fucking locked up i will beat him so fucking bad his ancestors on the next plane won't fucking recognize him thanks i'm trying real hard yeah progress i am an hr liability you caught him stealing your stuff laura and sam and you caught her stealing your stuff this is the most i've liked either one of you motherfuckers and i pull out my bo and i put it down and i say but i'll find ya if anything else happens y’all don't fucking know me (laughter) so smaller than this did any of us hear it from the second floor 13 what are they trying to fucking escape a fucking thump he has the hit points of a kitten what why are you getting teary what is happening was it that good santa klaus oh fuck i'm not i'm speaking as myself matt and what is happening to you now are we doing the level four thing now are we doing the level four thing or we doing it after okay i'll kill you in your sleep okay bye grab all the dice grab all the dice d8 for the monk as well a four right down the middle plus my con modifier yeah we've got to figure out what we're doing with this thing yeah kara she was the most shifty bitch she never said a whole lot she's the one i arguably know the least about-- well jester and i know the code to talk to the gentleman if we ever want to do that generally when a city is on lockdown though the sewers is the first place that guards are looking for shady people to leave where's our cart we still have our gypsy wagon no we haven't (laughter) is our cart in the city or is it outside the city we can bury him under a pile of produce or something like that try and sneak him out of the city also you know who we haven't checked up on bryce's sister right her sister their sister sorry bryce's sister is broken veil the name of a tavern here or was it in alfield i think i messed up and i wrote down where she is but i don't know where-- no wait yes bryce is in alfield yeah feelid bryce feelid watchmaster bryce feelid elf leader of the guard very sweet person these are all the things i wrote down bryce despises the dwendalian empire thinks they get no support being so far south from the dwendalian empire he's not from this region and then i wrote down ‘broken veil’ and ‘bluffs’ you're unprepared so i didn't-- i don't have the name of her damn-- their damn sister i think caleb was because it was right when we said we were going to zadash and bryce was like go look at this person sorry i choked on my spit wait is claudia his sister am i going around in circles it was claudia was it claudia this whole time it was claudia never mind and get horris out first right yannick and jan our blacksmith is taika waititi so into it you all keep talking about this pumat sol guy no i don’t do the magic stuff i tend to do other things oh really see it feels like an inside joke so you started stealing stuff in the first house we had the talk with her that’s pretty good though wait what are you agreeing with that he's nice or that he's working for the empire okay the two aren't mutually exclusive we know that right he can be nice and working for the empire the fuck 'sup little clammy i was thinking the same thing (singing) how much is that doggy in the window i'll go in on it what was in the box though originally how much to make it my concern i'm right here i can hear you all talking about me any other healing potions you got i’ll take one more as well taliesin are you seeing-- wait no are you seeing the potion of healing i'm only seeing the greaters i got one what is happening what is hiding in those corners though he runs the hall of erudition that guy's crazy gah yeah i don't know what i'm agreeing to (yelps) fuck get that i bet we could go back to the chastity's nook for that it's called the daring tales i make sure it's still there he didn't bring anything back to life that's good but now we can put the dodecah-shit-ball in the box and now the box in the bag right still crossing the streams all right all right yeah we have like 30 handbooks around here somewhere wait is she still a thing she's going to come back i respect her ability to handle her own shit on her own time they’re pretty great so i strap on the big gothy boots-- super tall doc martens lots of little fur-lined lots of straps and zippers how do they look yeah it’s hard to tuck your pants into your boots they're pretty great they add 1d8 to my initiative roll does anyone else feel like they might benefit from these more than me your initiative bonus is zero i feel like nott might be able to do some good with these too if she had them okay i’m sensing some passive aggressive-- thank you nott very good thank you thank you nott don't patronize me nott oh do i what kind of a saving throw oh that's not good for me nope definitely not (voice cracking) i am so happy (brightly) go talk to the gentleman of course (singing) 1-800-general i feel like it's all gone to shit i think that's exactly what this is smiling is so painful (groans) yeah yeah you're actually yeah i don't think you're so far off there's something weird that's been striking me with dolan this whole time he doesn't seem like he really has the tenacity of someone who actually wanted that seat maybe he was a pawn this whole time that guy is kind of a coward and i mean this with all due respect -- the guy was kind of a coward that's how you do it right no i am really interested in this kara girl i'm wondering if she's a puppet master throughout this whole game this is clive the bartender hold pause it's something along the lines of-- okay this is clive the bartender right yeah we are so beau and jester walk up and say-- 'sup i mean i know i'd like a drink but unfortunately we have no coin however we are willing to offer many gifts who the fuck how many names have you had no we never said to trust us we said not to trust us specifically
