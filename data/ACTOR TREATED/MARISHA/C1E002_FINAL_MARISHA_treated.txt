barrel for a hundred years balgus yes could we do that is this considered a short rest oh hieris do you know if there's any other entrances into the mine any old secret tunnels something that someone could be using to get in one last question you should come drink with us at the tavern oh that'd be nice oh we should get him something other than dried fruit that's not good for diabetes cross-realm maybe they have magical items i want stuff all stuff so wait-- it seems like they really don't want you in their door it seems very heavily guarded so what's our plan we just going to try again let's do it it's the mine that never sleeps eat some veggies fruit's bad for the diabetes and then you just throw it at him that's not polite grog i'm gonna go ahead and turn into a squirrel and hide in your pocket okay can i do a nature check to see what light source is making all this grass grow or if it's like magical growing is that a talent you picked is that a feat phrasing what are you casting i think you'll just like hit a wall wait wait wait i'm in squirrel form so i go out holy shit what the fuck breathe no wait wait wait cast it on me i'm a squirrel in her pocket i guess it's keyleth (bad scottish accent) oh hello (group laughs) keyleth is not good at this i hail from the mountains up north wait persuasion--i don't have--oh wait i have a zero eight oh i have advantage oh disadvantage so eight and i've been practicing my cornwall accent for five minutes shit i'm sorry i didn't think about the fact that i was gonna have to do an accent i'm not good with that stuff oxygen's good although if we have something to help with poison that might be good can we get some antidotes oh we were just there we don't have pike though i'm still not feeling well on second thought i'll just read some books tonight refresh myself on my healing spells it's what she's good at how much are the greaters i'll take one you should it's been a bad day for rolls it's been bad day for rolling to be fair it's been a long day i'm still bleeding everywhere it's the boot yeah i like the idea of magic perception i'm gonna assist her look for animal tracks five good the trail's going cold yeah i feel like going down let's go further all the way down get low this is scary i've never been on one of these before it's really tight it's really dark tight keyleth's getting a little claustrophobic she's never been in this tight of a space please don't do that most of them legolas style yeah what about the walls how close are the walls are there any scratch marks or anything like that on the walls but there are the drag marks all the way oh shit i hope he didn't hear me just say that about him dammit are there any drafts do i feel any wind flows or anything like that and so that is how i spent my 12th birthday let's see what else i agree with that into the river like it goes into the water why don't we send-- stealth twins a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions (lightning roars) under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics it is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in tal'dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do anyways it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe her father kohren realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hikes down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one thought plays in repeat in her mind is she even worthy yareth (group repeats yalreth in funny voices) oh making it old school while he does that i'm gonna go ahead and turn into a cave bear cave bears have darkvision yeah subterranean bears they
