i want that thank you to whomever got us this amazing super cool looking bottle of scotch matt travis and i know check that out it's taurez brandy there was a card on the box we sort of wanted it now so we jumped the gun i blame sam well thanks prometheus that's true yeah taliesin's coming thank you hi liam we miss you so much hi how's new york yay (laughs) seriously well they're a bit divvied up right now i believe pike is holding onto the sword correct i'm holding on to a ring of protection plus two and a belt of dwarvenkind hello percy hi good of you to join us yes how was your flight that sounds about right please look what we got this is a gift from-- what's his-- it's brandy it's really good brandy i have a ring of protection plus two and a belt of dwarven- it gives you a plus two bonus to ac and saving throws while wearing this ring and then i also have the belt of dwarvenkind the belt of dwarvenkind yeah you guys remember this it gives you a plus two to your constitution modifier you have advantage on charisma/persuasion checks with dwarves and you have a 50% chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you are incapable of grow-- oh that's right because you guys tuned out yeah we realized this at the end of the stream at the top of the day you have a 50% chance each day at dawn of growing a full thick beard if you are capable of growing one or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one and if you aren't a dwarf on top of this you gain the following additional benefits while wearing this belt you have advantage on saving throws against poison resistance against poison damage darkvision up to 60 feet you can speak read and write dwarvish that one you should keep that's just fine with me that's fine with me i generally have enough spell slots so yes we also got the coldsnap leather armor plus two which i was originally thinking for myself but then i realized i actually have decent leather armor that gives me spell advantage so i'm good on leather armor i thought-- are you sure sorcerers can wear it i thought they could wear robes do you have any armor on scanlan would that give him a plus two to his ac who wants the belt of dwarvenkind grog what's your constitution right now constitution up to a 20 yeah that's true i'm not going to lie or does it dissipate at the end of the day when you take it off i would just like something to help my ac 15 are you sure i'd feel bad because grog doesn't wear armor either he has better benefits if he doesn't wear armor you keep take that i think it gives you a bonus to your dex but that means everybody got something right did we divide it up that way it does what the pearl does but times three it's true (giggles) that is a true story he wants to make asami's glove shrapnel oh i actually join him while he's gone can i look around to see if he has any books on how to start-- like a potion making for dummies book more protect-y more-- yes 6500 we tossed it in with a deal

airship made out of and like skipper veera who was oh the airship i was about to say i run over to the side and look over the edge before he says that does the platform have like a ledge i can look over like the empire state building i want to do that guys this is really high i climb up on the ledge grog a little bit guys guys you should try-- grog hold the edge of my shirt i want to feel like

i know bye thank you for the food it's so good we didn't plug 826 at the top either so yeah for those of you who might be new those of you who are veterans you already know but 826la is our charity of choice they are a after-school non-profit program for kids k-12th grade and they focus on creative writing and imaginative storytelling and they're right up our alley and they have awesome storefronts they have the one in mar vista and the one in echo park if you are la local and there's probably an 826 in your area yes we need that i messaged them about that and they're totally down so yeah what what a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet (chuckle) of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions (thunder) under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally (soft chuckle) born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics it is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in tal'dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do (clears throat) anyways it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy what what happened that'll include us we're going to shoot a rap video by the end of the show oh is this going to be like a role reversal thing in like an alternate universe (laughing) yeah oh wait didn't we have cake i want that cake up in here are we going to wait get some shirts we forgot to wear one of ours but they're cool yeah we made those in honor of e3 by the way i will say soul hunters is a misleading title because that sounds dark and ominous and it's a super cute game yeah wouldn't you think it sounds dark and ominous it's super cute it's like with cute chibi rpg characters yeah i know yeah and me too i'll read books i'll also go ahead and-- oh you have this book are you reading that book i'm going to make a few scrolls in my time as well what should i make scrolls for guys what's handy to have what's handy to have well yeah i can make spells into scrolls right okay you're talking about the levitation and stuff oh yeah that's true i'll make a polymorph scroll and give it to-- this isn't world of warcraft well i can make-- i just put whatever spells i've learned for the day i can put those-- depending on the level like a 3rd-level spell scroll will take me four to six hours so the higher the spell the longer it takes so if i spend two days i can probably make four scrolls four or five scrolls yeah that's some pretty good shit so i'll definitely make a polymorph scroll for you that's the way it was in pathfinder i am using pathfinder rules i know (singing) we went shopping it's like i have a little familiar a scroll-making familiar four okay how much gold do we have left anyway okay so i still have a little personal money left too no it's okay no i'm going to do it that's what money's for i'm going to do two polymorph spells and give one to vex and one to tiberius and i'll take 400 out of mine you'll give me 400 all right shit i also rush to the deck feather-covered can i do a nature check do i do a nature roll first or should i do an initiative roll first can i do a nature check first cool look at that turn on twitch turn on twitch oh that's not bad that's all right i'll take that 17 yep (laughs) rolling dice in new jersey grappling oh no oh no he's going to throw him over the edge he's going to toss his ass over the edge does someone have a reaction can someone do anything reaction i have some grasping vines it would make it-- well it would make it difficult he would have to break against strength checks against grog and stuff yeah you say bad dragon or go peace out did you have disadvantage oh ooh you're the shooty guy i'm going to move my speed over here-ish and then would you say i'm 60 feet within range of that guy oh am i well let me back up a bit then just right-- oh i can walk across that oh fun right gotcha and there's still a rider on that guy okay i am going to cast polymorph on that wyvern and i turn him into a bunny rabbit oh i am going to kill a bunny that is true i just think it's going to be funny that's pretty much what i thought i guess make a wisdom saving throw-- the wyvern has to make a wisdom saving throw 18 a wyvern a bunny or you know what you know what would be funnier yeah we'll stick with the bunny bye he came prepared thanks that was my turn fail actually yeah i think-- it lasts for the duration or until the target drops to zero hit points or dies he just you know is a falling bunny will you let me know when he hits the ground when he falls yeah it's the same you throw a penny you throw a cow off the empire state building they'll both fall at the same time you got this ouch ouchies oh these guys got skills yeah okay go percy go percy go what's a wing shot that sounds awesome oh you mean literally right sure yeah (laughs) 24 hours (laughs) birds hate lightning yeah it's been a while yeah jersey i go hey friend let's do athletics oh it's okay 15 it's okay guys i'll be fine i'll be fine this is fun prepare it for dinner oh were you trying to skewer him you and ashley that makes up for so much shit before i turn into anything i take in the scenery and i'm like this is peaceful nice and then i turn into an air elemental (whoosh) yes not a shark i know that would be funny and i'm like oops it's okay i'm air so i'm there i turn into 'poof' okay cool i'm only 20 feet awesome it's 60 it's the same like all of them if you're moving through air and such i'm pretty sure okay so who's the nearest bad guy is that a bad guy next to him or is that a guard my air elemental's a big space right okay so here's what i do i go up and i'm like (whoosh) this big dark scary cloud and then i go up and i'm going to do whirlwind and i go full tornado full twister they have to make a dc 13 strength saving throw awesome on a failure a target takes 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage so i'll do that real quick that's okay so two one roll this one five ten damage and he's flung 20 feet in a random direction and knocked prone hopefully it's randomly off the side of the ship wing fail fail oh wait and if the target hits like a wall he takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every ten feet he was thrown if the saving throw's successful the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung or thrown-- yeah he still takes five damage that ends my turn to be fair you're in jersey so is that wyvern flying son of a bitch come on you guys son of a fuck we can't lose our captain damn it we hit 4000 rap video no wilhelm it's like a word of the day calendar healing word of the day nice nice tug-of-war batman do it come on you're a badass nameless npc is that like the only track we have is that bandit hanging on is that the deal come be protected by my sweet wind gusts yo yeah true that's like the most average that was like exactly average he's making sushi maybe you were counting this in why did i get in this line of work so everyone seems-- the only thing that's left is the wyvern right oh one you've got a rope on and is the ship still like ahhh it's still a little crooked okay i in my air form i'm going to fly over i'll go through and i'm going to use just my air form to lift underneath of the boat and try and stabilize it okay use my air dice eight outside of a natural 20 wow cool well i learn that the boat's heavy as shit that's what i learned this turn thanks oh it's okay i don't need you know comfort don't need validation save it for orion your armor class is 17 did you write that down i know i don't feel bad about taking the ring unleash that load yeah the closer wait wait wait can i catch it as an air elemental and bring it back up 12 oh i'm an air elemental shit shit shit forgot can i try and get that out i guess so to be fair we did lose one over the edge so we might need another crew member i know it was trolling over here i drop the elemental form no longer a tornado i know it's so cool i know it was nice i'm okay i'm okay
