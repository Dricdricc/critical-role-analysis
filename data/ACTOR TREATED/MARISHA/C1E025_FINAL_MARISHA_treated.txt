did briarwood go lord briarwood taliesin and oh he backed up beautiful so i take my staff and i crack it on the ground where i cracked it little ice crystals start forming against the ground and start making ice and i'm going to cast sleet storm i need a thing no i need a-- a laser pointer there you go so it's a 40-foot radius starting where briarwood is right starting in this line grog's not in it from here back so the ground in the area is difficult terrain it is covered with slick ice when a creature enters the spell's area for a first time or on its turn starts its turn there it must make a dexterity saving throw or else it's knocked prone because they slip and fall if a creature is concentrating in the spell's area the creature must make a successful concentration saving throw against your spell's dc or lose concentration and then i move back she's got to make a dex throw it just says they just have to make a dexterity saving throw or they're knocked prone oh is it 18 no they're going to bamf they dimension doored out i can probably teleport us through a tree right how roughly far away are they i still have my sleet storm up it's a concentration spell i'm going to move it over there yeah it's a concentration spell it lasts a minute well then i cast it again 150 feet and it's rough terrain have you guys seen them they're awesome it's been one of the most emotional nights of my life do we see him go find her okay wait we can put him in our cell we'll bring him to greyskull keep he's fine he's not bleeding it was non-lethal damage right he's not bleeding out all right i'll solder up his wounds a bit make sure he doesn't die also you're a common guard i'm speaking because tiberius would say this and he's not here right now because he's a little stupid at the moment but do not interfere with the businesses that we have already arranged with people who have higher authority than you back off oh i'm not good at this shit i'm going to train in it it's coming i also still have scanlan's i'm going to add my scanlan 15 no we'll call you the universal symbol for i'm choking can i do a health check on him 18 what time of day is it would the sarenrae temple still be open it's a church they're 24 hours right lillith that's so pretty let's just keep listing words guys lift where are you from your accent's so-- oh right yeah are you all right are you with the briarwoods well look we've got to make a pit stop at the temple of sarenrae anyway why don't you at least join us and then we can at least go back to greyskull keep for dinner because we also have to drag this prisoner back there it's along the way and tiberius is-- he's an idiot i don't know where he's an idiot right now damn it we lost tiberius you invited them in yes look she is traumatized we'll talk to him in the morning we got to go i turn into a horse and pick up vax and vex and take them to sarenrae's temple he used to be a very intelligent sorcerer this is part of the problem could there be side effects or something ooh do i recognize what herbs he's using nature check 19 so 29 excuse me do you actually have any extra of that glissfoil or any seeds that i could take with me that way i can just keep up on his daily disinfection thank you so much yes do you remember her tell them vox machina sent you yeah actually while we walk back to greyskull what happened it would have been true 30 minutes ago they said your family was still there how do you spell that we had a code word and don't we have a prisoner yes and we still haven't found what the broker-- who he is or what he is i'm pretty sure we would have to have an enchantment on our keep that would guard against scrying i go ahead and crack my staff on the ground and cast anti-life shell get close to me get close-- what did i but that's a spell i cast on myself the closer to me you are the more you'll be guarded by the shell you can still fight around it they just can't get in 11 11 bringing up the rears anyone within ten feet of me a decent amount right now not tiberius not scanlan nothing aside from undead and constructs can get into it you can still cast spells and fire bows and you can still do stuff we can go out they just can't get in do you mean 6th-level that's awesome she will wake up unless you cleave her in half she will wake up he runs he runs smack-dab into my wall my arcane-- blocks living things they can't come in like vampires yeah what is wrong with you but that was awesome that was pretty dope and advantage with advantage and a d6 upon seeing percy go absolutely insane and screaming your soul is now forfeit out of shock my anti-life shell dissipates and i spend my action staring at him you've got asshole this is becoming a monty python sketch we're focusing so much on this poor old woman and there's big intimidating-- 5d4 times two plus five we are being sadistic today oh you just elbowed me yes right in the funny bone plus-one wand of the war mage shall we throw him in the pen with the other guy your purpose in life is only what you make of it and what was the name of your homeland again it sounded very exotic we all have those lillith would you like to stay the night before you move on please have dinner with us and i go in the back into the garden and i take the glissfoil out of my pocket that i was given and i revive it from its dried state that it was given to me in and plant it in the ground what's your twitter that is so cool i was on the verge of bawling my eyes out
