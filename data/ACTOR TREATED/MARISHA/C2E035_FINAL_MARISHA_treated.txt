underground might help the situation okay i'll go with you on that how big is this ship is it like a ship or like-- any iconography on the sail hey fjord you've got that fancy armor that helps you float do you think maybe you could get underneath the docks overhear something no splash no splash ten points yes yes yes queen yes i turn to caleb and i go there i threw our engagement ring and our

drag him back i do that but like why why are my rolls so garbage do i get advantage because he's incapacitated fucker okay i grab him can i use my bonus action to try and drag him back i do can i do step of the wind and then fucking move him back yeah i'm going to come up behind him and grapple him and put my staff around his throat making eye contact with everybody else yeah i back up well you
