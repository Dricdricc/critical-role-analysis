i'm an independent woman all right and we got hacked which means we made it (whispers) grog (whispers) your pants they're sagging a little bit why (whispers) they're sagging where's garmelie i look regal and as we pass elves i say good day that's not normally what people tell me that's right what were the name of the guards in emon did they have a name yeah totally yeah that's true we never really see that this is gorgeous look at the craftsmanship it's incredible good day good day good day they respond better if you say good day and if you have your head up bidet yes good day maybe a chamomile it would be great oh here i pull out some herbs that i brought from my garden some glisfoil and other things they won't scream at you when you pick them good it's good oh i'm keyleth of the ashari good day i think she means your name but you can call him whatever's available as well we're trying to head to the shademirk bog we're looking for the bow of fenthras it supposedly lives inside of a cancerous tree it's like being on a ship forever so you're trying to go after thordak himself that's your first target thordak also it would be nice to find shelter for those of us who are not titled no not you good day (laughter) yeah that one and then we've also killed a white one brimscythe that's the one i pull out a dragon's tooth from umbrasyl out of my pocket and i toss it to him that's the result of the doings of your children you should be very proud percy no don't die i'm being blood out of your jugular just go with it is that a swear word i've never heard a soldier say ah blue sparkly poo i feel like she didn't get that from a soldier pretend i'm pretend handing it off if not reach out to allura of emon i had a feeling you did (laughter) does everything look like hitting on people to you scanlan take off the beer goggles take them off those are plus-two magical beer goggles take them off we're those terrible-influence side of the family aren't we it's the one scanlan burned but you have a title we're respectable i know are we all in rooms next to each other are we in one room have they already locked us in our rooms she was right behind us so can we have like a little family pow-wow in maybe one of the rooms before we all tuck in for the night and you put the masking tape over each of our doors so we don't sneak into each other's rooms high school field trip yeah and wine maybe some wine i was wondering where my tea went garmelie can i try oh i got a 17 i'm way more better than scanlan natural insight 28 i do a little entangling underneath of him and start checking his pockets tsa style start giving him the frisk into the pockets in his vest pockets you little devil is this a pocket of holding i think about the fancy silverware that i might've seen in syldor's house i think of fancy teacups because he mentioned drinking tea goddamn it i think of gold oh i think of gold sorry i'm not materialistic i mean i'm not i'm a barbie girl in a barbie world (laughter) ow that's true i have them written down (laughter) of a threshold crest oh no right in the other dimension that they came from you realize syngorn didn't originate here in the feywild right oh lord have-- oh sweet sarenrae oh my god she's got a pirate tri-corner hat oh my god like peter pan i have a vague idea of why you might want a piece of the threshold crest but why would you want the high warden's hat they stole his emmy because it ultimately doesn't matter you know how awards work come on oh hang on before we all leave vex and vax what did your dad do back in the day because he knows allura and he talked about knowing thordak does he have any type of fighting capabilities because it sounds like he was a part of the mission to lock in thordak 11 or so years ago he mentioned that he's been down this road before well if he sells politics there could be a lot in selling war against a dragon i'm not trying to be a dick but your father was kind of a dick so i'm just questioning it i'm not trying to talk shit about your family okay i'm just saying thank you i've been learning from you i don't mean to question to him he just said a few things that raised a few hairs on the back of my spine about this time i use alter self to go a little half-minxie and get those-- like when a dog is pissed off and it puffs up the hair towards grog i do a little gust cantrip from behind the door to make her hair blow in the wind (laughter) aw man aw they're shedding on it they're those little blue stones that are keeping the city here although grog doesn't have the worst idea and i don't mean smashing vax's head that's not what i mean but don't we have some hidden gems because i'm really terrified if we start hacking away at these stones what might happen so maybe we can do something kind of fakey is he asleep he's asleep right that's an emon tradition we're overseas remember i turn into minxie and resign to the idea that i'm going to be sleeping with garmelie and trinket and just cuddle next to them in minxie mode oh we're not sleeping i'll come on am i going to freak people out if i walk around like this i drop minxie form because that seems very aggressive can we have your hat she might know about fenthras and the bow what if she's wearing the hat what if the hat is on her head good day are there chairs for all of us shadowmurk bog that's the one shademirk that's it i thought it was blue might be green yeah you didn't sleep scanlan so there's no real easy way into the bog is what you're saying got it oh my god they're so cute though they're amazing shoes i didn't notice them until you pointed them out sorry no continue on oh wait wait lady high warden i'm sorry i was just curious it's my first time to syngorn and it's in the feywild it's special right is there a gift shop a visiting the temple and sights of syngorn type of shop right oh thank you do you get the monthly newsletter oh my god vex are you okay oh no what

gift shop it might fix things okay i start pretending like i'm doing a cure wounds spell to her wrist you know wait you're taking us to the lost and found please this is the high baroness lady vex'ahlia can i ask a logistical question is garmelie with us or did we leave him behind what grog wait is this an investigation natural one keyleth starts talking up braum braum braum so braum where're you from oh it's all for-- really oh you didn't see any distraction you didn't see anything okay yeah sure yeah your four-star rating just went down to a three and i'll also pick something random out of spite i'll take this i like it i chose it on purpose that's awesome and did you say i had a half a tobacco box or no just a tobacco box an old tobacco box all right yeah sure keyleth takes the potato okay give it to me give it to me okay wait do we find any pictures of threshold crests or a postcard we'll just go good day i think percy and i can fake them out wait is he around don't say it out loud how long have we been awake at this point but they said they got these stones from the other side from our realm i've got plenty of energy i'm-- marisha and so tired right so wait are we all in our own individual rooms we can go into our own rooms and i can fix it if we don't want to tip people off it's for prayer we have to pray remember right grog keyleth says we're totally polyamorous-- and i turn percy and vax into squirrels with polymorph see polyamorous okay i drop polymorph that's what polyamorous means right guys okay and looks like a crest and i start casting stone shape right under the threshold of the door to the room that we're in and i cut out a crest from the threshold a whitestone crest from the threshold of the door there's a piece of your threshold crest (laughing and cheering) let's go follow the finger my hair is messed up and i transform into a goose and come out as a goose always duskward she's not wrong well you're not entirely wrong i don't know if i can teleport via plants because generally that takes knowing the plant however i do have tree stride which means we can-- nope never mind i can only do that on myself but i'm loosey i'm a loosey goose we can mist there i might have to take a hot nap yeah yeah the answer is yes i can do all those things if we can get to the edge of the bog then we'll take a sleep we'll go until we're tired robert durst shit don't touch the grass it'll get angry at you it'll yell at you for a week what i was just trying to protect him don't does the grass seem angry suck it grass because you suck out the joy of all of us living around you and you're so amazing i mean you suck out bad-- i feel like the grass feels our emotions i do an interpretive dance -- to avoid the green sea how long have we been awake if we want to mist there then we have to sleep but we'll press on for a few more hours question you mentioned we are going into the moonbrush with lycan hunters yeah no
