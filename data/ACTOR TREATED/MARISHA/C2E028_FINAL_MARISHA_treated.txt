we made announcements online we're trying to get better at spercing our announcements out through other things yeah oh yeah yeah we mentioned about going and looking to see if a tasker would be up to it there were the taskers and there were the other group of hired workers is it like the grudge gang is an umbrella corporation of the taskers or vice versa i mean just to play devil's advocate here is it an issue if we get a hired mercenary group to kill another underground faction in their same town is that-- yeah i don't know it's a weird political issue hiring someone in the system well this ophelia wants us to kill everyone in the motherfucking house i think she's right plus who knows who could arrive in the time that we're gone i think we need to be prepared for all of them i miss jester's healing spells i mean look the solution might end up solving itself who know who in this town is even willing to go up against the iron shepherds smoke them out that's actually not a bad idea now that i think about it though (laughing) sorry i'm just imagining an infiltration with the spider like that's feasible go frumpkin go put him in his boot sure literally anything is better than a spider though for that i just want to point that out i mean they've got a lot of eyes i get that but i think in terms of a movement situation spiders aren't the best shady debaters laura make a shady debaters debate team shirt i've got a little bit of funds if you go under equipment-- same i have one healing potions ooh that does help those are good those are great i'm into it yeah i like the idea of getting some sort of fighter especially if nila can maybe take out that outer onion layer with the lightning we should have found a better analogy i like that ophelia mentioned that yeah aid i oddly trust that more than hiring someone from the grudge gang i feel like the grudge gang might have ties to the iron shepherds or at least an inside man i've seen some pretty badass priests in my day did we hear what god they worship i feel like if it was one of the accepted gods of the empire you wouldn't have to hide out in the woods i'm kind of into this idea the ones in captivity probably pretty unstable being controlled they arguably have their shit together way more than the three of us do yeah especially jester what time is it you said it's four hours there brisk power walk there that'll get us there right around sunset talk to people power walk back should get us there back-- yes in time for saturday night live (laughter) great we might be able to go and get back in time is what i'm saying and still be able to attack tonight if it is a total bust then that sucks that's true all right let's go are you good with that nila you seem apprehensive well shall we let's power walk you know like grandmas in malls like around christmas time yes that's still reliance nott do you want the middle fuh-wumpkin that was almost great (whispering) yes yes we can't see over the wall i think this is the place we buried him with it but that's a good idea this is what i used to do to hop fences back in the day i look for a few broken-down branches that might be my height a handful ten before i do anything with it i take it over to nila nila have you seen any type of blight on a plant like this before do you know what this is it's cold feel it i take the branches and i try to lay them down over the vines a little bit and give a little less thorny of a ramp look they hook all on their own that's pretty good thank you look at that on the tombstones that are around do i recognize any of the language or can i tell how old some of these gravesites are 21 until recently okay what's the name tyriel castala casala wait back up a second are you mr clay caduceus clay is that caduceus with a k or a c okay caleb and i will share one and i hand the other to nila a few great tragedies well the first one is i think it's time for caleb to have another bath it's been a little bit being without a shower has been a bit of a tragedy no i didn't want to open the gate like that that's why we're here do you only gauge time in seasons that's fair we're drinking dead people tea very true but you're cultivating dead people for good tea yeah okay yeah that's a good point okay well beyond helping our recently passed friend how do you feel about helping people who are on the edge of life and death in captivity and they might not have long to live we're working on it dead bramble dead mushrooms dead moss is there a watering system or can you put it on a timer if you're not going to be here maybe we're in a rush maybe after well we came to you you don't have a particular penchant or sympathy towards people who eat babies do you was that you saying you're willing to kill people and put them in the ground to make compost oh man you're seeing me at a relatively calm moment actually don't overthink it (whispering) fungal armor your blood-- you got some to spare you can get more of it that's how your body works hey clay did you bury tyriel colsala here yeah him that's what i said (accented) casala were you around when you buried him all right power walking we might be all right yeah no the fuck i'm going to try to catch it okay i roll a d10 a ten plus my monk level right which is five 1d10 plus eight oh it's my monk level plus my proficiency bonus so no damage and third of all that was a killing blow you could fucking kill me i'm keeping this bolt this is mine now i rip the other one out yeah i put that and i'm keeping this one too don't infect me okay this shit's dope that wasn't for you never mind i think we were going to go straight there it's on the way it's on the way i say we at least stop by and scout it how long after dusk has it been are you being facetious i can't tell how many seasons old are you 25 i'm still afraid if we roll into shadycreek-- once again just pointing out what we are two firbolgs a goblin and then some kind of acceptable-looking people and someone with a reputation well by society's standards look come on i'm just saying we will draw attention to ourselves and then we might go around asking people to kill the iron shepherds and that might draw more attention to ourselves in a town that it feels the iron shepherds kind of run or at least have a better foothold in it than we do do you know ophelia clay sorry you just had a face like you recognized okay anyone in particular feel super strongly about going and getting more help should we put it to a vote what does your smell bag say do we go and we get more people or do we go to the house make a smell check i mean she's so convincing all right new plan we split the party half go to the house the other half go look for more help and then we meet you watch all right let's go to the house yeah let's go we're wasting time just talking we'll go look shit i've got fireworks he isn't let's go 12 can you bring him back i kind of want that arrow do you have an illusion that you can do that it's a good idea maybe we should've done that to begin with all right who votes for more muscle let's put it to a vote how tall is the wall how would i be able to get on the wall are we walking the perimeter if we're doing a perimeter walk i want to look and see if there are any branches and trees that might be growing close to the wall that i could-- yeah we've got to do both at the same time ideally there's got to be a team one and a team two on the guy i've got my throwing darts but they're not super great also sometimes maybe it's just a stormy night here in the forest okay here's what i'm going to propose we split up three on one guy three on the other we'll do the plan that worked when we were doing it on kids and we didn't know we were doing it on kids me and you can throw up a bottle rocket that will be the signal we attack both of the guys at the same time two different sides but if it's loud and they're both dead afterwards we want to murder everyone inside and rescue the people who are trapped all right let's split up take these guys out jesus we wait an hour and get into position we watch the passing shadows in front of the windows no i'm right next to you yeah i was just trying to move things along yeah we'll wait we'll just wait an hour that's what i was thinking at least to get into place and then put it back on okay until the next shift change i could use a short rest anyway i think so can i take a short rest and we watch and we solidify our plan how are you lifting that have they done a guard shift yet go charlotte go you're radiant how big is that spider that looks like a three hit point spider that's arguably terrifying i'll give it to you i was a little wrong just a little i'm not terrified of it i'm just saying it could be terrifying hi frumpkin one firbolg each we'll take the old one table and table i don't know i can only hear muffles choice words i think they're talking about you though oh yeah death is weird am i right how tall are you would you be willing to give me a boost up that wall copy also the thing i was looking at our version of the smell bag it's like this artifact that we got from an assassin that lets you look into the creation of space and time and the universe yeah anyway how far does your message work so we wouldn't be out a message range of each other when i get up there and grab him i'm going to bash his head in and i'm going to throw him down and if he's still alive you get him i was figuring i would be on her shoulders and we would suck up against the wall we'll see yeah right underneath him keg liam and but not as short as nott pass it along makeshift harpoon that's pretty cool let's just do this come on we're going to wait for our guys to pace-- uh-huh with pass without a trace they're here go pass without a trace we're going i'm on her shoulders i'm up against this fucking wall you're doing this i'm going to try and (grunt)-- i want to wait until right after he passes and then i want to do some ninja stuff i do that's true mmm then that gives me a 20 total okay 20 i cursed you woo he's held as soon that i see that he's held i am going to jump up and try and grab him by the pants and bash his head in and then throw him down okay just a straight attack okay 16 no sorry 15 aw i rolled a one plus two plus four six damage i go nila now i will finish my attack right as she whacks her staff i'm going to let go and try and time it to where i land on the staff with her mm-hmm 23 23 that's much better eight plus four so 12 damage i do the same thing i slip into the guard uniform would you mind giving me another boost real quick i look over at deuce and give a nod i can unlock the front entrance for you guys do we want to go front entrance/back entrance yeah make sure we get the gold out of our dude's pockets you're right there on the ground is there anything on the dude's armor that i put on investigation sumalee and i say meet at the front gate i think you still have pass without a trace on lasts for like ten minutes i think lasts for an hour sumalee and i signal to deuce i don't know what else to call you clay hey look at the windows too okay i'm going to slowly start pacing around towards the front i'm also going to look into the windows do i see anything from my vantage point natural 20 thanks gil coast looks clear i don't know why i did this with my fingers it's within 30 feet of her so yeah i think she should be good but i think you have to cast it on the people within 30 feet of you for the duration each creature you choose within 30 feet we don't see that i didn't see that kill it kill it yeah she did with the trapdoor yep is it phil i take back mocking you for your choice i thought it was going to blow our cover i do another check to see if i see any movement upstairs i just want to make sure by the window all right the rogue did blow it don't die also 21 i'm actually going ahead and roll my d8 with this as well plus seven 29 sorry 28 wait who was a 12 you okay i want to look at the window do i see that figure i just saw does it seem like the pots and pans got that figure's attention and they're hastily moving okay where am i i'm over there okay i am going to-- do i try and make a distraction or run i'm going to light one of those firecrackers again and i'm going to toss it this direction towards the front of the door natural 20 i want to try and aim it to where it sounds like there's a commotion happening at this front door to draw people this way and not at the back i'm assuming that was my action okay i'm going to use my movement to just haul ass towards these guys yeah okay i'm coming into you though i'm coming into you guys okay have i heard my cherry bomb go off oh what amazing okay i'm going to move my full speed my 40 feet does it get me in 14 okay i'm going to use-- no i'm going to use my action to move again to dash nope i'm going to go that way okay i don't want to peek around the wall i want to ninja dash around and i want to get up against the wall peek and look for anyone who might be coming around that hall as i ran by i went psst to caleb to let him know that i was here and going that way i'm like i'm going to watch this way watch for me let's hope this works the way i have in my head mother's vengeance fuck you phil (singing) i can feel

dash come here i'm going to spend-- do i want to do this yeah i'm going to spend a ki point to do that thing that makes me move fast step of the wind yes can i open the door is there enough room

the table can i get on top of the table that's cool i want to gauge it right over keg's shoulders and throw two darts over top of her shoulders to the giant barbarian behind her hopefully or ricochet whatever's the coolest yeah okay first one 17 13 on the higher one that's a 20 what do these do these do a d8 damage these do monk or do these-- these are the-- no these still do 1d4 right so the
