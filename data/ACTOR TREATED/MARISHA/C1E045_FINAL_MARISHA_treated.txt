yeah the first epil-- episode the first epil of-- epil epilay epilogue the first episode of signal boost went live on tuesday go check it out on geekandsundrycom go watch it it's good fun and you should go watch it so we don't get cancelled and we'll keep making more episodes apparently it's crazy yeah and i talk about rat queens in it and-- and i tell you about cool things that i like that i picked out myself my favorite things done love you seattle and we are not held responsible if that happens that's a good idea i've got a set of green dice i'll get them out sure got to get them all out and i got this in ireland so it counts it counts and this is green damn it you beat me to it i was going to say those two aren't mutually exclusive children and traffic what time is it here that's true we did sleep actually we camped out remember you talked to zahra and i talked to kash then we slept we at least chilled i don't know it's always weird not crawling out of trees that people like us kima-- wait what why i can always attempt to scry and see if i can check in on her okay let's get somewhere safe here i guess i don't know i forget it's not overrun by vampires i'm sorry sorry i forgot it's all right now like right here sorry there's a lot going on your shirt is that new because i love it so much are we heading to a tavern oh corpse armor be very careful when handling this armor is what we're trying to say it's leather do you have fancy leather armor right now what does your armor do right now anything (groans) not again why do things like living in gems it can't be comfortable encased like something put it in there ooh any way we can find out what it possibly is before we summon it well does it change size we don't even know how to open it up do we know how to open it up hang on okay let's think about this what do we remember from the great purvan's story what did he fight can we get purple cardstock up in here what if he's friendly i mean he talks about being an ally well then wouldn't we want to save it she's like-- neutral maybe we should save him and release him when he'll be valuable to us who knows if he'll go back in willingly but wouldn't we rather be friendly with him than him be angry at us the next time we release him but we could win both but we could have a trap and a friend why don't we try and do a little bit more research on galdric first (muffled) what if-- we g-- mm sorry little bit of saliva snacks we go to those goliath caves right outside of whitestone that were abandoned those sorry i just remembered you recognized them they were empty and abandoned we could go there no we saw it on the way into whitestone we're healed right did we sleep do we need to sleep like drink and i should probably scry and check in on allura right where'd kima go anyone else want to go to the-- i go up and put my hand on her shoulder hey how's it going yeah want to check in on allura is there an empty room around here doesn't need to be that long sure we'll try really hard to find better things to do with our time okay just pick one yes the flower that i gave her before we left she's alive her and drake both are alive they're at the cobalt reserve which is in ruins as well as the rest of westruun yes the black dragon is there looks like he's taken up residence in the black spire-- tower what was it called that one no i can just look in and see she was grabbing the last few important tomes remnants left from the cobalt library i mean reserve it didn't look like it i don't know i didn't see i don't know who all's coming his wife and children are here as well as gilmore you haven't met gilmore man i just assume everyone knows each other he might have been slain she's the dragonborn-- not only did he escape he tore a giant tear in the rifts between the fire realm and ours kima kima it'll be-- sit here you want to sit down let's go outside what okay yeah keyleth has a hard time looking her in the eye vex i don't want to ever see you like that again i don't want to ever see anybody like that again we all watched you die it's like-- i guess you could say probably an unseen entity an unseen force oh i'm lightheaded okay percy-- let's skip that when we brought you back kashaw performed a resurrection ritual yes and he called upon a deity and at first he was afraid that it was vesh which he was quite terrified about yes that i don't believe is the presence that answered his call i thought i was going to lose you both i thought i was going to lose you and vax he-- i don't know i don't know what he did he said to take him instead is what he told the entity he offered his life for yours and my biggest fear was that neither of you were going to come back he offered his life for you and for all we know that offer was accepted if i had to guess it was probably the raven queen herself he seems to do that quite a lot i stay behind and burst into tears in the outhouse sorry keep going siege arrow that's fun i have a question would keyleth and scanlan be crying in rooms at the same time (singing) beneath the pale moonlight i open it hey hi you okay come in sit down how do you feel do you still feel her i don't know if it was very noble or very stupid to be honest probably a little bit of both i can attempt a greater restoration spell and see if i can sense anything can i just lay back i think this goes beyond any natural realm that i have any bearing over and i hug him i thought i was going to lose you and i'm terrified i'm still going to and i think i love you i just don't know if i can allow myself to i'm terrified to allow myself to you do realize that if by some crazy chance we all somehow make it through this domination alive with the chroma conclave and i complete my aramente i'll still watch all of you die everything could go phenomenally well and by becoming headmaster we enter a bit of a realm of immortality where i could live for a very very long time i'm afraid every time i look at one of your faces that it's going to be the last and i feel like deep down i know that day is coming so because of that i'm afraid to let myself feel anything deeper than i already do and for the second time today keyleth bursts into tears why do people keep leaving me in rooms alone we're in a drought god damn it it's been a while do we come out and see vax in the armor so i guess i step out and see him looking at it in the hallway i walk by and briefly lock eyes and keep going without saying anything a coffee enema going to the caves on the edge of the woods going to go through the woods wait wait wait fortress whatever should i throw a wall up do i need to bar the entrance or are there doors so we're going to try and talk to it scanlan you prepared so those two are stealthed-- i'm at scanlan's left shoulder back a bit and trinket's next to me i'm rolling with trinket yeah we don't know how to use it i pet trinket like 'chill chill be cool' wait use speak with animals i cast speak with animals okay i cast speak with animals and i crouch down to the ground and bow down a little bit and i say are you the one they call galdric was purvan your master oh my god i get a secret i can respond back right your master died a great champion for the raven queen he has been paid a great honor and now the raven queen has chosen a new master i continue to speak to the wolf a great darkness has fallen upon our lands upon othanzia we could use all of the assistance that we can achieve would you be willing to find a new purpose join vax'ildan-- yes galdric please approach your new master and look into his eyes look into his eyes i said look into his eyes and see the touch of the raven queen inside of him galdric grog don't move don't move look at the dog don't move and don't hurt the dog please just look at the dog i spoke words at it apparently that's not good enough communicating very aggressive okay okay if i turned into a dog if i turned into a wolf do you think he'd respect me more i take my staff and i say galdric i'm being assertive you want a task i'll give you one i don't know oh has it not been ten minutes okay we walked back okay i'll cast it again can i cast speak with animals on other people i can't right no with advantage i'll take the-- what is that 16 plus a six so 22 he talked back okay (louder) galdric only a beast of your great fortitude-- right okay sorry would you like to guard-- -- the town whitestone (shouting) guard this town dog yes galdric in exchange for food shelter and a cozy fire every once in awhile-- patrol these lands protect these lands why does he want details why does the dog want-- (clears throat) a great danger-- approaches a great danger approaches your service is required until that danger-- has passed is no longer in effect you'll know you'll know because they're fucking dragons man you'll know protect-- then you are free to go thanks galdric appreciate it man i look at grog how was that did that sound okay thank you it really liked you you should learn how to talk to animals i think you-- yeah you know sometimes the teleportation makes you lose your lunch trinket you all right buddy you all right there how was the ride did you feel all right how was-- what was it like in there was it-- okay that's good that's good would you mind-- would you mind doing that you know frequently on occasion matt if she wants me to okay you have a lot of men who will do anything for you oh my god you're right we don't have to worry about it we can it's fine that's the other vestige correct but we can go wherever we want as long as we've been there before oh god i'm immediately nauseous oh trinket buddy what time is it does anyone have any fire-resistant items i might pick up some fire resistant potions as well they're pretty sleek are you fully attuned percy you have access here in whitestone to alchemy supplies correct i mean we could take the rest of the evening and i can attempt to make some fire resist potions well we're going to be in for a fight at the fire ashari as well because there's a giant sunder in the fire plane and last time i checked there were fire imps and elementals pouring through there they're annoying well i mean we could theoretically see if there are survivors and i can attempt to close the tear in the plane i don't know if i can do that however i don't know anyone else particularly more qualified to attempt it we're talking about the fire ashari and possibly what to do there we can go and look for survivors-- and someone should probably close the tear in the fire plane if there are survivors-- they've survived i agree it's not going to be pretty i really don't can i start telling that to people in real life yes your secret is safe with my indifference to look for survivors and close the giant tear in the fire plane that evil well not evil fiery entities are pouring through i have another question before we all go to bed tonight can we get like a fuckton of the green stone under whitestone say like $1000 worth and maybe have like a real nice heroes' feast before tomorrow i've got to do it at night because i have to tree stride in the morning yes i like that plan yeah sounds good to me yeah sure why not can i make some potions and then like i make dinner for us before we go to bed i'll do a damn feast all right okay yeah yeah let's do it let's do it let's go in prepared and then we can always rest on that side aw an arcana do i get advantage because of my little skill in alchemy i'm skilled in alchemy yeah okay intellect

go to the sun tree oh god as close as i can get to the fire ashari i guess oh do we gain a few hours awesome can i do a nature check to figure out what's up 16 do they look like people like humanoids 800 feet they could still be ashari just in their elemental forms are there any birds around i look up do i see birds in the sky let's stay far behind let's go quietly the string's so you don't forget 32 as we're walking up i fall behind and i slip vax the potion of fire protection much better that's a natural 19 30 those are druids and i write-- hi hey you guys i write in druidic symbols keyleth

daddy it's good to see you again father father i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for these people they are the most capable that i know however since we're druids we're a little bit more you know geared
