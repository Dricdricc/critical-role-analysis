it's my true destiny yeah we do our best there was definitely more than one it was at least two or three dayana prucine oh orentha i think it might also be smart to see if we can drum up any type of handwriting samples for possibly both the lord sutan and the high-richter so we can more convincingly forge documents with his brain with his head you're good at forging right we have to get some handwriting samples right of the lord and the high-richter that way we can write letters make it seem like they're-- nott i think we’re going to need you to both break in the house and also maybe into some safe that they have in there yeah you're good at lockpicking no we’ll be with you you can say it nott what was the last thing caleb said what did he say that’s not what he said but that is delicious and now i want some i have i am definitely proficient in mail fraud there would be a public record somewhere right and generally those public records tend to need to be open for-- well i will say worst case scenario we don't necessarily need to match her handwriting but some type of coding potentially linked back to her we can almost mimic it people who are doing sneaky things never use their real handwriting sure maybe some accounts of the myriad --of requital where i thought you were going molly which isn't a bad idea to leave some sort of money trail is leave a certain amount of money with any type of paperwork that might also be mentioned in a document in the adjacent house so paranoid rich people are always paranoid rich people right so they always have these safes filled with documents were you guys paranoid yeah we also need to find where lord sutan lives correct they might even have some sort of documentation or record remember dolan was saying that they got ousted from their practice because of this lord sutan maybe they already have a paper trail we do nott tracked them do we have any-- that's going to be really cool when i can do that really cool catch a fly anyway moving on that was me i wonder if we can track down ulog you think we're big fish i tie my robe it's all i've got no i got that yeah okay well then you go feel free to give me like a-- i'll listen for the pigeon there's a signal we have one do i see-- sorry knew that much this is really good all to know now we're getting all this information laura and i don't know i'd say take the foot-in-mouth signal (drawl) mustard biscuits what did they say though okay all right yep i'm keeping an eye out for anyone watching oh and it's super interesting-- also super interesting that they mentioned having other people do their work for them (pause) okay let's go he said they have other people do parcel service and stuff for him see well maybe not even a signature most people trying to be smart about not getting caught aren't probably like my name and social security number you want stationery sure okay well how about this i think the seal is going to be good i think any type of money amount mentioned in any of the letters and then we cross that and leave that type of amount of gold in the-- like there's been a money hand off in between adventureland and frontierland (laughter) yeah yeah yeah okay well how about half of us go to lord sutan's and half of us go check out ren's i'll go to check out ren i could get through the gate okay i'll go check out-- yeah we can manage ourselves we're good we got this let's go what time is it the leaky or the song & supper we're talking about two different-- leaky tap hour and a half all right break i flip it to the blue side cobalt oh i'm-- literally like 24 hours ago thank you are the gates chained shut or does it look like there's a lever two in front does it look like there's any blind spots any trees that go up and cusp over the walls not good eleven it's a big jump but we can do it it's not too big that's doable yeah from rooftop to wall that was what i was thinking wall to wall do they look like one of the-- no balcony so there appear to be-- no balcony okay uh-huh a dog i like dogs yeah maybe a drunk a drunkard trying to break in somewhere else you know a public disturbance yeah i mean our group is pretty good at causing distractions they can do that that's totally- yeah it's going to have to go fast yeah we could do that do i have a climber's kit i don't have a climber's kit but we can go buy a climber's kit yeah okay guys let's challenge ourselves we have to break in only using ball bearings how do we do it yeah do there seem to be any weak points any loose bricks in the walls as we walk by i'm playing with the wall but i'm testing for weak spots oh i understand now oh there's no-- okay you know when i used to hop fences back where i came from-- if you're ever trying to get over barbed-wire or any pointy fences you take a rug or a bedroll and you throw it over there and you hop over and you-- yeah i mean-- i'm just throwing that out there it works a bedroll is not too bad yeah yeah yeah let's go sure (groans) we're just trying out the gym we're not fully committed to it yet all right second time your cat just vanished simon what kind of dog was it its name was princess come on stage makeup class this is going to be the weirdest fanart ooh i hate him i hate him already i'd like to say i feel pretty good about our casing mission in the meantime me and jester are like what’s taking them so long he took an hour to cosplay his dick why are you covered in mayonnaise and egg and hot sauce is that hot sauce you guys look real defeated over here you look palpably defeated what you what all right you know this could lead back to make it look suspicious if we go after lord sutan if his son was just broken into right he’s going to know his medical notes are missing right all right okay sure sure all right well i mean that works because as dolan said these fancy people tend to get other people to write their mail and do their paperwork for them so… yeah that never changed nott over here knows a little bit of thieves’ cant it would look shifty i’m just saying from my experience normally if you’re trying to do a coup-- as a rebellious teenage woman in my experience normally if you’re trying to do something bad you’re not like “dear diary i did this bad thing signed beauregard” you get what i’m putting down correct we want to look-- if it’s too obvious it’s the opposite of convincing this guy goes by the gentleman because he is smart that’s all i’m saying “spoke to the myriad” yeah… it doesn’t really matter and a little bribery if we’re trying to go for something it depends if you’re just handing money off to an assassin if it’s a lowly level person might not need much doesn’t need to be the whole amount just needs to be a payment maybe the big o thing the plan against the big o “it will commence-- “ “commence as discussed” and it sounds super boss aw you beat me to it no signing it with a kiss what kind of dog can the cat become a mastiff here’s the deal nott-- yeah we need to leave no trace the only way this gets pulled off is if-- is if no one thinks anyone was there ever we also have good ol’ fjord who can always disguise himself as a guard correct i think that’s a good idea a few papers are always good why is there a magic pack in there beau gets a little too aggressive with the pillow fight sorry sorry should we get some awesome all-black clothes yeah something a little bit more stealthy oh i like that i see what you're saying yeah do we know anything about this festival like culturally do they wear masks i think we should go shopping masks on sticks but will it get us through the gate are you afraid they're not party people well then we go from there she's got a point show us where melrose is leave it in the trash that's not bad that's not bad man that is the oldest trick in the book sure don't write “the knights” though just write the little symbol to fight orentha to kill her i feel so political you guys i feel like i'm participating in our politics in a way it does it feels like i'm making a difference feels like it matters yeah we didn't get paid in advance i hope that doesn't come back to bite us once again we should leave no trace that we were there correct so first-- with the cat we've got the cat plan yeah the last thing we want is for the crownsguard to think that this was all us in front of the-- marisha and i was going to say can we hop a ride no that brings a lot of attention chasing after a carriage that doesn't mean that won't change in 30 seconds do you want to distract him and we'll meet you on the other side okay nott or caleb can send you a message 15 why is that their natural response in this town rat-balloons oh fuck shit we were supposed to go fucking meet ulog damn it we recapped this at the break too damn it oh come on ulog it’s open mic night you got this (laughter) (pigeon coos) oh shit we almost forgot about ulog oh shit how well do you know lord sutan’s place and the area all right yeah the fiviest i hate the color yellow i just hate it any of them look familiar don’t fuck me gil meh you kind of fucked me there ten fuck why does it feel like you roll crappier when you’re lower level 13 same guard are we catching them around the same time this is his shift same watch all right all the way around with the spikes and the gate is closed but he can still be enough of a distraction to get the guard to chase the dog while we get in if we can get the dog-- maybe to the front side that’s what i was thinking go into the cellar as soon as the dog chases away the cat well-- maybe that’s when fjord can come and relieve the guards or he can do that now but how do we get fjord on the other side of the gate what were those guards’ names there were so many guards yeah but as long as you do a guard that’s semi-recognizable yeah but spikes all right all right up the tree i'll go first so i can try and help anyone else as i go up can i do that athletics or acrobatics (whimpers) but parkour that's not great-- i got to get up there eight give me a boost (whispers) sorry (pants) i'm sprinter i'm not an endurance person okay you're strongest oh god don't let it get caught i don't know what to do is it flying out of our grasp is that what’s happening she's going to try and catch it wait quiet shut up (whispers) okay maybe if i get over i could hold the other end and help people i think i can look we're basically gods okay (laughter) i'm going to cast step of the wind-- sorry not cast it i'm going to use a ki point i'm going to take a breath gather my chi along the edge of the branch anime run-- step of the wind gives me like double jump distance or triple jump--dump jist-- hang on (victorious laughter) i don't trust gil right now i'm not going to trust gil i'm going to go with cobalt die natural 18 i go along the rope and tighten the rope as i land i was like tracing the rope when do we do the cat the cat there is a chimney stack though right what who would have a door on the roof i look around is there a door on the roof 18 okay it looks like they need to re-roof like they haven't done it in about 15 years right so maybe we could get in or go through the cellar or be like santa claus it's happening now it's real time real time i think there was a guard named cloen who was the guard who saw the spider just throwing that out there got to get through this roof i step around how do the shingles feel nott do you have a dagger can i borrow it can i borrow any bladed thing thank you i'm going to jack it up and see if i can-- does it feel like a trap door oh my god yeah pull up the shingles those could be valuable are they clay shingles very valuable yeah (laughs) okay do you want to let them know that we're going in then beau will go down first i do the cool thing where like i slide down like a fireman down the ladder a little bit well i look real cool for five feet jester can you go ahead and cast a spell the locate-the-thing spell leds yeah oh fuck there's undead bodies in the armor breaking the law that was him that was him i did not say that dope yeah someone stay watch we're

something that i have yet to do which is extract aspects then i'm going to see if i can catch any reverberations off of the rug constitution fail i want to know its damage vulnerabilities what's it vulnerable to what do i get something else hey guys nott's in the rug hey guys nott's down-- oh shit hits hey guys i think this rug (choking) and before i got wrapped up i said it's not immune to any-- (choking) it has no weaknesses-- (choking) no it's fine (choking) this is the best can i do any type of attack what can i do i just have disadvantage okay i'm going to try and elbow the fucking

about ulog do they have any symbols on them on the statues do i recognize any symbols or see any symbols on the statues ten it's okay he always gets his squires to do his dirty work but we have the seal he's working with the myriad and all that stuff earlier but we wrote up the letters for the high-richter too just so we can stamp yeah we did because we put the knights of requital in it the kr
