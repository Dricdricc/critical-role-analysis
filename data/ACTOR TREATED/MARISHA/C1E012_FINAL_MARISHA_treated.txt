hello may birthdays for the win dan casey dan casey everybody dan casey in the house yeah dan casey hollywood squares we have more gifts i kind of think that the idea was so that you can be clarota i kind of think that's what they were going for but can you eat can we blow it up can we try it out uh-huh dragon strippers that's hot right ify thanks useless rogue thanks scott i was gonna make a he was asking for it joke but i feel like-- took the long way around no i don't think anyone does that anymore like goes y'know-- if everyone can turn to page 62 in the player's handbook we haven't short represent also having a healer is really nice yeah nice being able to have a healer just saw zac perk up there total boy scouts this is feeling really meta true neutral do it i have the four-- those four right up front there you are woo if your stats are super crappy we'll roll again no we won't not tonight never mind but normally if your stats are super crappy-- what we generally do is roll all six and then write them down and then decide where you want them okay yeah i generally have a charisma of eight but i have that circlet which is boosting me which just makes me average right yeah you get certain racial stat bonuses depending on what race you choose okay who wants to pick who for their coach do we have like individual coaches we're doing backgrounds now yeah but do it do the background-- pretty good an hour later (laughs) i'm pretty stoked for the characters we've got some good stuff going we've got some good stuff going don't forget enhance ability hey don't forget hey the hunter's mark hunter's mark don't forget hunter's mark actually dan made his character with his background this way so we can just hear about his background as an example but he did roll a dice to randomly generate it he clearly fleshed it out which is incredible some of my favorite-- oh go ahead i'll go first some of my favorite characters that i've played with have all been people who decided what they wanted to be first and then picked a race and a class around what they wanted to be so our good friend paradox really wanted to be like a roadie who-- (laughter) so one of the things i like in pathfinder there's like you can make a geisha dancer who did damage with fans so you can pretty much be whatever and then figure it out from there oh my god i forgot we're sponsored by them i love gilmore a little thing for vax that piece of fortune you handed over no that's gonna fuck us so hard one of these days it's been very helpful one of these days though you're gonna like get a-- you're going to roll a 20 and something terrible is going to happen yeah and i did something similar with like my four tribes of the ashari you know i've got i've got the fire tribe and the earth tribe and the air tribe and the water tribe but from keyleth's perspective i'm from the air tribe i don't really know a whole lot about the other ones they're there so i gave him the idea of the tribes and the backstory that they exist and now he's fleshing it out for me that's so cool it was very frosty yeah see i'm not the only one don't saw off ify's arm don't-- nope put it down drop it drop it 12 well that was like two weeks ago for you he's not trying to outwardly kill you he is scary we say fear the wrath of god for a reason d&d has a lot of life lessons in it we're all gonna die someday yolo it sounds like you're being a little bit racist right now by the way when one of us dies we're all gonna fucking bawl our eyes out it's sad well you also i mean you have this handy screen deliberately so we don't see what you're doing bullshit it's a roleplaying game it's in the title come on go ahead i will say while you're looking for a question-- yeah just like real life anyway should we trade places so that some of us are sitting next to them-- but i didn't know if we wanted to help them salty pete (whispers) it's a clue this door is gonna be the worst boss in the entire game that poor horse i'm pretty sure this is about to be manslaughter deception check i made it silent oh shit what you gonna do (scottish accent) vehicular manslaughter classic dwarf we fought some golems before san-de-cline eh sandy cline oh shit total reload that bow dat bow though had some habanero sauce recently oh snap i knew i should've stayed home today another die believing in yourself is a lie once again d&d teaches real life lessons believe believe salty oh no salty do you have eldritch blast one's all he needed how many hit points did you have left are you trying to say stop the bleeding with thaumaturgy is that what you're trying to say by screaming at it finger-scouting mission what is it party title party title all about that you looked so happy i was the same way i feel your pain i really wanna see salty pete with his cape what do you look like salty pete nice (laughs) metal chains i've seen that at anime conventions i'm pretty sure i have so here's my question 'cause was this your first time playing d&d too dan but this was your first time did you feel like it was intimidating the roleplaying aspect of it at first and how-- did you feel any awkwardness easing into it oh we missed that resurrection appointment reschedule oh shit it's the good the rad and the nubbly run run they're the fuckups of emon you're just that adventuring party where whenever you roll into town we're just like (sighs heavily) i actually had someone tweeting at me being like you know talking about us mentioning how you shouldn't be intimidated by roleplaying they said yes but conversely not everyone's an actor and i just want to address that like roleplaying has nothing to do with acting roleplaying isn't about acting it's about playing pretend it's about make-believe with emphasis on playing so just play it's not about coming up with a character and a motivation and any of that it's just about playing or that money as sarcastic as zac is being it's totally true it's totally true like if you guys notice they made their characters while matt was talking about dming and then they had fully fleshed-out characters by the time they started playing and mainly that's because they just had a few solid ideas and then their characters built as the story unfolded and that was great that was awesome and seriously if anyone judges you because of your roleplaying fuck them they shouldn't be in your game anymore where is this going where is your cake the non-licensed happy birthday at least yeah fuck you twitch (laughs) winston birthday and we had to leave i locked my keys in the car cake attack classic birthday huzzah
