that was so good that was-- are those the critical role dice sets oh my goodness it's true i put a bunch in my bra walked around for a day boob sweat high five deuces (laughs nervously) she found you same that was two natural 20s it's true and he was all poo-pooing on the dice keyleth goes up and does a simple medicine check just to see what's up with him 18 i think he needs his rest percy can we station some of the best sages and doctors to watch over him yes can i do an insight check she seems worried is something wrong do you have to leave immediately you seem tired we've all been through a lot you should rest a day let us know if you need our assistance oh yeah what time of day is it so crass we weren't done on our side keyleth taps vax and says smooth nice one and i turn to kerrek and just give him a massive hug thank you so much for following us into the fray literally into the pit of the beast-- so thank you there's not a lot of people who would blindly follow us there i don't know if would say risking your life is a pleasure but i appreciate your positive attitude on the whole thing (chuckles) i'd say you definitely spent your time wisely what do you plan to do next okay well thank you for everything sincerely i give him another hug and say goodnight and go in the castle i then go i was going to go find allura and actually ask her if she had a message spell or a sending spell and i was totally gonna do that before (all laugh) everyone staring making the jokes about us being shitty and forgetting because that would be awful-- --to wait for 12 hours to figure out if your friend is alive or dead (all singing) somewhere out there-- she must be insane right now or half drunk or both yeah i would be okay thank you you too thank you i think we'll head back with you tomorrow to emon so we can check in on our keep once vex'ahila comes back of course swamp ass swamp crack yeah i know that's pretty funny well the math is always how much you've had to drink versus distance it takes to travel to your goal 'cause they kinda balance each other out the longer you have to go-- yeah but oh i gotta go a mile ehh half of it's down stairs i don't know i had nights like this in college you guys this is not cool (all laugh) this is not cool when you wake up like this eww i feel like i want to do you've got the nightgown and you've got the pudding now what are you gonna do in cross stitch on my wall oh oh shit we've been playing this game for like five years this is like two and then-- two and a half four and a half i think it was spring break cancun how was your night where are-- did you-- how was it how was that town yeah no oh sure yeah really i never pegged him for like-- no way what shut up (shocked gasp) eskil you devil you little pit fiend you look at you (whispering) oh he's having a hangover meal (sigh) well i guess i mean we-- i know allura's going back to emon to check in on things since we kind of left in a hurry but i guess we should wait for scanlan to wake up he didn't come back last night so i'm assuming he stayed there she's in a really good mood i know i didn't know you guys had that kind of relationship (laughs) you said girth vex taught me that was funny (all laugh) dress sequence oh shit ooh yeah ooh i wrote that title down grand poobah this is very important-- grand poobah de boink is the title i wrote it down of all yes in charge of all of this and that de boink like des moines but de boink of the vermont de boinks i immediately look to the sky do i see any sign of the ashari and what do the clouds look like really okay no sign of ashari he slayed a dragon the big green one it's true he's a badass kerr vox machina was better to have you and you know where to find us there's a green dragon waiting for you he's in my house and you have to fight me to get it so but it's technically yours whenever you come for it oh shit that's fair you got stuff i imagine it's wood and it's box-shaped a ton of stuff we need to do which one and a rakshasa to kill maybe we should start with checking in with home seeing how the keep is we haven't been home in a long time i guess we were just there in passing no i'm tired marquet right now maybe we should also check in with some of our other keep members and see who's alive and who's dead oh that's right i totally-- that's right did he come back with us or is he still in whitestone we're fine right that's true who was acting as-- so as a quick recap he stepped down and gave this whole speech that he sees the flaws in one ruler and wants to hand it over to a council rule-- right he essentially switched it from a monarchy to a republic okay do you need help in finding your friends okay kima's with us right i grab vax and vex really quick and i say hey you guys are really good at asking people back for the stuff that we lent them i feel a little rude doing that but you guys are good at that so-- the boots see you guys are good at it pike is very clanky no offense pike you can keep it they're like stealthy boots they're silent and you don't have to attune to them look we smoothed it over we're cool now (laughter) you are the cutest thing sometimes well wait aren't we going to check in with our keep if anything that means we came to emon for nothing-- --except to go to our keep that's true and as i'm walking through i keep an eye out to see if there are any ashari lingering around but i'm sure they've all bounced at this point alright i'm gonna use my druid die oh okay just straight perception 26 sure yeah i've been gone awhile okay so the storm crest still fighting all right thank you any bodies that i pass by that are ashari i druidcraft little flowers and do my own little rituals as i walk by yeah get this place lively again hire people i go through and use my gust cantrip and dust off some shelves and straighten some paintings i'm fine with that it's not like we're gonna be using it any time soon yeah let me check on the garden too pike do you want to join me how's it looking wow overgrown's better than dead all right cool it's nice it's kinda rustic so adorable what time is it oh man so we're just going to go bury ashes in vasselheim no fighting yeah we're not gonna get into any fights right okay grog why are you making that face grog why are you holding your breath if we run into bad people we can fight them powder i didn't eat any no unnecessary fights okay all right well that's not unnecessary didn't we kinda look before we thought the same thing and it's-- but didn't we do an insight check and-- right but it was protection from what i remember from my-- i can look right from senokir cause didn't i do an insight check we plant a seed of a demon spawn okay hang on hang on give me a second his wifes name was zofin senokir's wife was zofin zaafin nope that's all i got i feel like i remember-- well we already have a tree but yeah make like a leaf and wait-- make like a tree and leave (laughs) well wasn't he kind of stuck in the fire plane-- yeah oh man you guys i thought this was something sweet and we weren't gonna question it and now we're making it complicated i don't know anymore we're all too scarred and damaged we were all on board for this until 20 seconds ago when we started questioning it (all laugh) vax are we taking a peek it might backfire vax the raven queen is like your girl can you maybe like there is remains in here-- pike you're a cleric if you're that concerned man this is so extravagant you guys when he told us it was his wife we all went awww when that happened and now we're questioning it who is trying to sell you magazine subscriptions who pike we have to sail the ocean i just wanna let you know i feel you but i'm trying to make this our first step into being a more positive vox machina this is me forcing a smile there's pain under here that's why it looks like that sorry oh right i'm supposed to hide behind and bottle those emotions right no things are great yeah that's how normal people talk right things are great yes we're all huddled around a box just like freaking out right now all right let's go huh what he told us where to bury her right i have passed by on the outskirts so the abundant terrace is a forest on the outskirts of the town oh right right right oh perfect farming district okay is there a tree there in trees that's cool i want a tree house okay and you said it's safe this isn't arcane it's natural since melora i'll probably be okay people aren't gonna look at us weird when we come out of a tree on the other end sure sofine sofin zaafin that's probably true (laughs) we saved the world but we're still a bunch of assholes what am i doing abundant terrace ho we'll have six seconds to think about it can i do a quick nature check to see if this is a mystical realm or if they've done something naturey to make it-- 22 i remember he said he wanted us to plant the box under a tree the birth heart hi ask them where the birth heart tree is whispers with their next theme taliesin and build tension build stress yes build anxiety disorders i guess we'll find out they said we couldn't miss it all right we're trying to do that thing where it's not like you're walking to your car after you've already said goodbye yeah yeah we do does there seem to be one central tree in the center of all this or just a massive-- yeah yeah yeah i thought we already were doing that the birth heart shut up don't judge us of melora oh shit all right there's a starbucks i know this is so romantical i go up to one of the worshipers of melora oh hello i am keyleth of the air ashari what's your name lamor pleasure to meet you i was just curious-- lamor i want to write this down before i forget uh what l a m o r okay i was just curious we are here to pay our respects and to do a favor for a friend and bury his fallen wife is there a specific place where we can do that and spread the ashes in a respectful manner below the birth heart tree i just don't want disturb the grounds really of course i have no problems with that thank you do you have any suggestions kind of new to this one of her favorite locations yeah okay well i think we would just like to bury the box without disturbing the box right guys okay yes that's great yes great okay look i feel like this is an exercise in simplicity for us and trust right right it's not you it's us (sighs) we really are wait did you say something about a resurrection you didn't say that did you right yeah totally they might be chummy well well melora's more neutral she's more nature is-- earth tones you know fall colors guys when we set out to do this we promised we were going to make this easy and simple and we can't even do that we are torturing ourselves we are-- -- making this far more complicated-- okay okay look all right pike if you want before we do this i could do a commune with nature and maybe study the lands and see if i could maybe connect with melora maybe through my spire if you want okay or we could just put the box in the ground jesus you just put like a we are not responsible for any damages clause into the contract would it be okay if i just picked a couple flowers to press and take with me for remembrance thank you i could stone shape something simple that's true that's true i out of the ground stone shape what looks like a simplistic fire branded wedding band okay (lets out a deep breath) who are the priests i was just curious because you see i have this staff that has melora's marking on it wow that's-- you know that's quite a reaction i wasn't expecting that i found it through a series of very hard and troubling events and circumstances okay (inhales sharply) (all laugh) (laughing) fuck you travis yeah okay you know that's enough that's enough touching what if her aid-- (clears throat) what if her aid was best used-- -- in the world and not maybe in a museum look-- (sighs painfully) you know i don't want to hold on to anything if it doesn't rightfully belong to me but this has also been lost for a long time so who does it rightfully belong to and i'm trying to do good with it okay i just-- i don't wanna-- uh-huh i promise you i will and i'm very grateful and i do feel very blessed that i found it and that i have this power you know-- (sighs) is there a way 'cause you see i'm not great with the gods but i've never really spoken to melora i have a lot of friends who are very much supporters of her is there something i could do to show my thanks thank you lamor i will not forget your words (exhales) okay people keep telling me that okay all right thank you thank you (whispers) i'm so conflicted thank you okay bye yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah shut up percy i think she had just left no i'm sure we bored you several times with our god mumbo-jumbo tell me how you really feel grog yeah you know what never mind i take all of it back the temple of the raven queen do you even want to today you know you never came back last night thought you were gonna come back carry on (laughter) (aside to taliesin) what do you want for me to cantrip two plinths yeah i think i can druidcraft that show me what you've
