wow that was so authentic to the actor experience it's a regional spot it smells good too it smells like new comic exactly yeah it's bottomless in the name of science a little burny is this quickly like not paying close attention quickly yeah we're fine i think he was being genuine i feel like that was the most emotion-- a little his ears are getting a little pink i'll helm sorry 17 moving what does the weather look like are there clouds in the sky it looks like the landscape is going dark not something moved in front of it or like something is moving who's got good eyes and knows about clouds and shit does that look natural to you if we move though we have to move fast and maybe a little bit carefully all right can i go ahead a little bit and see if i find any hidden paths that might cut through this field off the main road scout ahead a little bit i have ball bearings i rolled a 15 how far away is the army okay i'm going to come over and be like i think we should hide and wait until these guys pass with this being the situation are we going to get questioned nott you should hide i agree what's our story we're just traveling hired hands we are going to go to the swamp and look for yard work maybe they can help us fix our wheel good day the labenda swamp you included the horse have you seen the frontline before it's fitting that the traveler helps fix a wheel it's very poetic i like it she did just lift up the carriage hey fjord have you had any more weird dreams are your dreams affected by the weather like if it's cold do you throw up ice shards instead of salt water or something because that can be cool okay we don't know if it's seawater though right it could be like saline maybe that's your problem this whole time are we exposed like out can we all huddle under the-- i mean (snoring) full tauntaun style soaking i was curious of that too how close are we to the xhorhasian border oh there's druvenlode there's max load i mean if he was taking the leonardo da vinci approach then it could be accurate max of lode i'm going to get on the cart and try and put my cloak over me i look at molly underneath me on the cart and i fart a little bit just a little sorry oh shit (yelling) that would be fucked up if you used that as your exit wait where-- what do you mean ashley left (whispered) lemonade i heard it was bad luck that's what i was told fuck attach it to the back of the horse go yeah yeah how do you mean you need more incense what kind of a shelter like a dome like a bubble dome how do you mean beau does pushups while waiting for molly i'll be in the cart i'm okay at surviving i'm going to take my staff and poke it in the marshy bits it sounded like an alert to me (cawing) maybe it's a mating call does it sound like multiple or from the same source is this considered the berleben path the bromkiln so this is not-- does there appear to be any sign of wreckage or anything else that looks like it might not have made its way through this path because of other dangers 15 but that was a bit ago that's not as good this time 12 nobody move if you're going to move move onto the cart are we on horses something just moved in the water it might be able to hear our movements though it moved away though i take a ball bearing out and toss it and throw it into the swamp see what happens he's probably going to die oh man poor guy he'll be fine would we know if this is the stretch of road that they were talking about that they were having issues with what are we saving i'm still on a horse yeah i'm on a horse yeah i'm staying on my horse (galloping) how cool is that the thing that we've been hauling around you have to stare at it for a minute for the next eight hours 15 mm-hmm from my perspective it looks like the gator is super stoked about having this lollipop (heavy quick footsteps) this is so prehistoric we're the brigade are we doing this birds die this way all the time what it's feathery what if it's febron am i able to have enough movement to get on this stumpy stump i don't think i'm-- i'm not within 60 feet of any of them am i no i guess i am to throw a thing can i use my bonus to move a little bit further onto the top of this tree my step of the wind i can't get within range of them with my step of the wind though right fuck god damn it if i move straight yeah i'm going to ninja star for my main attack and if i can-- i don't know if i can-- i can't move on my bonus can i only if i move a ki point right nah fuck it ninja star okay that's a 20 for the first one ooh and a natural 19 for the second one these are 1d4s right yeah i think it's 1d4 for the first one that's seven for the second one that's five gambit style i point at percy and i go he did it oh i called him percy i think that's the first time i've done that i point at molly he did it aw i miss percy that's cool how often do you get to add that see now i'm getting little mermaid vibes though from the gator (singing) up where they walk up where they run up where they stay all day in the sun caleb or fjord sure can i get to this guy who's got nott okay i'm going to parkour off i'm going to do a parkour off of the rock and come down and try and get it right in its mouth to try and get it to spit out nott so the first attack that's good that's a 21 that's better that's 22 spit it out both of those are the same which is seven uh-huh i'm going to spend a ki point now to do two more flurry of blows that's an 18 and they just keep getting better and that one's not great that's worse that's a 12 you know what i rolled the wrong damage die for those first two but that's my fault six damage i rolled d6s instead of d8s that gator got lucky well wow yeah question would this trigger my reaction for sentinel okay okay okay that's good to know oh this is nott's turn sorry now do i get that opportunity attack i whack it right in the nose because that's what i was taught with bears i go no sam and they're all the same in the nose natural 20 be high okay 12 damage he's going to phone a friend but in the case the friend is nathan stewart hey chris perkins it's the chalice dilemma hero's feast with the chalices oh yes it smells a little like tuna and that's not me though i'm telling you it is a bird person maybe he only repeats what we say how far have you traveled do you recognize people that look like her matt seems adamant that can't be good would i recognize what species or race of people empire kids wouldn't know the whole studied thing that's what i was thinking it's kind of creepy man oh yeah you've got oats let me hold this dagger for just a moment i'll give it back i just want to test something okay we're just going to test your reflexes here no a little sparring punch here hit here can you-- (punching sounds) i just want to see before we give a dagger to a child to attack my hand okay i don't know if she needs a dagger here you go child we're going to die first can i take a short rest then to get my ki points back that's this kid's parents the cousins yeah like a rorschach test well he said that they were cursed they lost their ability her sisters parents are alive we shouldn't go fighting with her i don't know we gave her a dagger point her in the right direction that her parents are going well if she comes with us then we will kill her unless we can drop her off on the nearest town exactly i don't know guys we've seen how people react to nott around here what if we drag her in front of some crazy locals birds don't like cats sorry cats don't like birds frumpkin starts chittering
