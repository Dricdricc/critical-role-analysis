we're winging it today sorry it's so hard to get all of us in one place at the same time yeah we'll bless them or he will valentine's-- next weekend come spend valentine's day with us even if you're not a dm you should go look at them so you can keep making more be a kind clicker (last of us clicker noises) the internet always understands sarcasm hey scarf man thanks to the critter who sent us bacon jerky that was amazing honestly it's impressive that you were the one that lived yeah are you kidding me he'd be the first one that would be like oh rivalling-- it is adding to like the tavern-ish feel of this place we don't know we could be all that's left but does it lead out into the city what where gilmore's it depends on who knows it's a way out of the city once again that was all through the-- through the bar in the-- allura how far does your arcane connection reach can you feel when you lose connection to other cities you're leaving this is a takeover for some reason thordak doesn't want to leave this city why well they just made it to westruun several hundred miles away in all of 40 minutes i'm tapped out too you're going to go on foot allura if you're going to westruun and what you say is true that we have two potential options for finding out how to defeat these dragons should we be heading to vasselheim maybe that's best where we're needed right now yeah for the most-- yeah yeah it's the city that was closest to pyrah my people my tribe we could pull double duty we could go and i can-- grog now is not the time it's a hazard zone right now yeah that thing was also several hundred feet below ground how are we going to get that dragon down there being shady that's not a bad idea you might be surprised you might like it you know speaking of spies does anyone else feel like this is fairly convenient timing someone in that council had to have known this was happening wouldn't you all of the cloudtop district was in one place someone knew it was the perfect opportunity to strike they took out the entire upper echelon of the city in one strike they waited for them all to be in one place the timing was perfect that's all i'm saying what if we go and find a shady individual like he was saying what if we don't send in scanlan what if we find someone you're probably right which happened at nighttime remember what time approximately after midnight i druidcraft a little tulip and hand it to allura in case we need to be in contact yes we've learned that much what time-- wait hang on i still have one 5th-level spell left i can commune with nature and try and find out if a few people are still left in the city before we go to sleep if we're not going out i can commune with nature and try to find certain people all right i go out to pike and the sarenrae temple you will be all right everyone calm down we've had a rough day and it's been hard on everyone but you should be safe here for the evening hopefully everyone-- look i'm not-- i'm trying on this whole leadership thing okay ugh eight any little bit of hope works secrets your sword you're promoting gilmore's to your sword i reach out and i grab her hand and say thank you truly for everything i don't know but i want it well i'm doing my commune with nature spell i drop down and mediate do i sense gilmore's presence a few miles a presence can i focus in even harder and find where that presence is coming from more directly his shop okay last question do i sense uriel i don't know it's hard to say we should check his shop first uriel i don't know maybe he's dead maybe he's gone i don't know i don't know how about this let's find gilmore if he's alive or dead then that will answer a lot of questions how's that so we're going now tonight i don't know maybe we should go how bad are we okay i remember well-hidden wait what we only restore half each night just half good to know i don't think i used any sexy sexy exotic accent wait you hear that it's pens

polymorph we need to make him tinier anyway what do you want him to be i have a question if i polymorph trinket can i then use beast sense to be able to see through him would that be able to work beast sense lets me see through the eyes of a beast but does it stack with polymorph and if he is like polymorphed into-- i mean i guess he's still a beast all right it's fine but if i turned him into a bird i can make him an aerial scout is what i was thinking like the wargs in game of thrones i will make him a cute little sewer rat or like-- can i make him a lemur (laughs) how about a red panda
