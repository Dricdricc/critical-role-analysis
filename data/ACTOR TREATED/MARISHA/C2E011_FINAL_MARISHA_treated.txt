saturday we have the sagas of sundry panel in room 300b at 200pm i think somewhere around there then after that we have the women in pop culture panel everything is happening in 300b nein are we making our way back okay let's go back is that a thing the greed of the crown man i love the rain let's go to sleep okay that's a good idea i hate ticking or repetitive noises that's so obnoxious that exactly like that that counts as well yeah the same umbrella category yeah we just woke up we're real tired okay jesus you're super spooky at night you know that you're a little pale so you have this ghostly quality to you i don't know why i'm whispering we're all awake now you all right maybe she was a ghost the whole time that's heavy metal that's a possibility she probably just took off to handle some yasha business right though we'll ask molly we go downstairs that's better we were talking about a couple people watching out front right someone from your deepest imagination green's pretty maybe you have a cleft chin yeah and very curly yeah she did that thing again does she sleep she's a little creepy in like a hot way but a little creepy yeah kind of it's very mysterious i mean we all have personal issues who you us yeah it did seem very pointed and targeted see i'm having a hard time myself getting through to caleb so i feel like it's hard for an asshole to teach an asshole i should punch him in the face i was having a side conversation you can learn a lot of things from being punched in the face maybe we can also take the day to ask around and get a little bit more of a bead on the opinions of the locals on the current political climate you're very smart jester are you going you're going to the fancy place he's going with jester yeah i'll go with you guys along the way can i look for a tailor fucking balls seven someone who can sew me a custom coat a cloak or add a lining to something like that do they do custom there that's fine done i would like to take one of their cloaks and have a blue liner put on the inside to make it reversible like one of those baggier poncho coats one of those thank you sir so many things i had one of those last campaign that was a ring of holding yeah good stuff i'm all nice and buttoned up belt tied looking tough it's a good name zombra spire-- zombra okay it's bel-air okay it was so good too almost did you see that history six yeah it's like the zauber spire the constellation bridge and whatever the triumph tower is chime i think it's a church or a cult or a church-turned-cult i don't remember it is like a tiki bar maybe we can go shopping and come back i'm following by the way oh my god edubation it's because this whole place is magical caleb does there appear to be a used book section like trade-ins huh okay you can learn a lot from what people wrote in books hey jester do you think that the fact that this place is called chastity's nook gives everyone a complex who shops here yeah (whispers) aw you beat me to it i would love to see it right now do you have a sample what is it she's very heavy-handed with her innuendos they keep talking about the heft of his equipment a lot of reference to his equipment yeah it's-- do you-- oh do i fuck i was thinking of fjord as i was trying to be nice it's cocked right okay thank you 18 you know there seems to be a lot of machinery knowledge and like heavy machinery knowledge was that also an interest of yours man i've never seen engineering and-- combined consider me interested yeah i almost asked if there was is there a mailing list you got to get the word out get people interested sure oh caleb yeah there are muffs like hand muffs (skeptical noise) as we walk along to the pillow trove when we walk by the flowery bushes i slowly pop all the blossoms off the flowers as i go she's really pretty yeah sure your hands are dirty you're covered in bread oh that's right would you like that would you like some mitts you know this is how diseases are spread right okay did we get a good view okay natural 19 plus three so 22 at the top of the zauber spire what do they look like are they wearing any colors just looking just you know people watching these two assholes up there on the top of the zauber spire liam marisha and hey the whole cerberus assembly thing do you know much about them yeah no i know we're both empire kids right more so than the rest of the nein what do you think about the empire about the crown okay i think it's kind of bullshitty i don't know look at this look at how much money is up here compared to elsewhere this is a lot of control (laughs) (sighs) no i just want to make a ton of money and drink a lot of booze i think best we can do is try and be happy in as you said this shitty situation that we've all been granted yeah anyway should we go mind if i take a look at it i'm going to flip through it does anything catch my eye based on what i know you know this reminds me of the stuff that i used to read back in school no like all the history stuff it feels like a bored monk wrote this a real bored monk i might read it later when you're done reading it really it's a great gift honestly i was thinking about buying it and then you beat me to it great minds right what's this book called does it have a name courting of the crick i know yeah i'm not going to be able to type that in i'll write that down you see why i left this town ugh people good when you all are good (singing) okay before you leave real quick beau asks you if you found any information out while you were on your journey really i'm with it right interesting we went to the fancy end of town where i'm pretty sure everyone is super into the crown because they are all funded by the crown and they are the crown so i was like eh probably a bad place to start asking political questions we did yeah went to a smut shop as to be expected smutty what should we do yeah in case it's a trap or something also we know that people are looking for these type of rebels if we can see a board ratting people out so can other people we don't want to get caught in a sting operation for lack of a better term yeah big money are you fucking serious wait they're both threes i rolled two threes both threes four so seven can you try and pick this oh my god i'm going to stand watch in the opening of the alley i'm going to make sure while he does this we could get nott in here to try and pick it just leave it nicely looked like it's not opened yeah i'll be right back nott i hate to interrupt your dinner can we borrow you for a quick second can you pick this yeah yeah he takes one end i take the other jesus fucking ballsacks seven again oh that sucks oh i have thieves' tools can i try i give nott my thieves' tools yeah i stole them off of a really rich guy yeah you'll just owe me later how about that i put on the goggles it's not the same cellar there's no entrances no secret entrances no trap doors hiding behind barrels don't fuck this up this time come on it's cocked on a 20 what well okay what am i doing investigation 11 any good bottles of wine or brews laying around there's a skeleton down here did they not clean when they bought this place yeah hang on no one's around right i'm going to pull out my adventurer's kit and light a torch because fuck this darkvision shit no one knows we're down here right the door's closed okay do we see anything else weird more dead bodies anything like that that's really gross yeah anything else now that i have the light on i don't see anything shit (long sigh) i take one of those bottles of beer then i leave frumpkin i don't know let's do that you can message caleb or any of us okay any other prep we should do okay let's do this get food i'll read some of my book iva go kill-- that feels a little premature i want to know who he is though super interested to find out who this guy is i feel like we should deal with one thing-- i'm super focused on this current-- last thing we want is to take the fall for these assholes whoever they are read the book you go back and forth conflict between the julous dominion dwendalian emp that's good 17 theo okay sam and ruined forever okay test of wits like dinner with andre style the assassin removed his helmet wait am i writing down smut right now travis matt and hang on are you going into how theo and the assassin had a thing okay keep going i'm into it though this has to be important he's telling it to me okay he's a dark elf right or a drow that's cool it's meant as an intimidation tactic it's this high-pitched screaming cricket chirp that rushes in so that's where the term crick comes from it is used in a derogatory fashion towards individuals who live within the empire of xhorhas and kryn the book talks about them dueling wits finding common ground and getting angry at each other and murderous then turns into this torrid love affair in this very anthony/cleopatra feel to it it's very dry it's an older book it doesn't match some of the imaginatory flair of some of the other smut that you briefly perused as you were walking in the bookstore earlier you glean a little bit of information should this be accurate at all of some of the relationships or dynamics of the empire and the xhorhasian folk that live beyond the border it's not like by the third lamppost remove this brick okay cool this book sucks halfway maybe couple hours yeah tton it is yeah let's do this okay table right is it just the four of them no more okay yeah we sit it's polite a valuable asset good with things thrym the human male especially considering you said the richter was already pretty corrupted seems like assassination attempts in reverse wouldn't be out of her bailiwick here's my question to dolan why do you want-- horris wants to be in the office dolan what makes you think that you can beat the system that you would then be joining yeah sorry about that well you could do a lot with a seal from a lord a lot more than claiming an assassination attempt just throwing it out there literally anything else it's an okay name you could workshop it there's always more names there was also the notice on the king's hall looking for y'all i don't know if you knew that by the way i imagine a notice in one of these people's houses might mean that they have concern of being found you could win twice now the lawmaster works under the high-richter right yeah kara i think it's kara i like that tell us about this myriad a little bit what is it exactly that you guys are so nervous about with these people what name should we be looking for i'll give you one piece of advice dolan though i would challenge you to think about this for the night think real long and hard if you're willing to jump into the ring some pretty high-ranking asshole gladiators should probably be willing to take a few licks shut up you know make sure you know what you're getting into awful people powerful tricks that's all crazy travis and i agree who knows we can't be replacing someone corrupt with someone even worse yeah we don't know anything about this dolan this horris' motives or their agenda should we go now we would have told you the two humans two humans house rule yeah just a clown actually that was pretty cool you learned something i agree yeah maybe we can even split a team some people go and spy on the house some people maybe go to the stockade talk to the people she's locked up i'm down for that well is ulog still sitting at the other table at this hour interesting i don't do anything for altruistic reasons well if this plan gets pulled off and we help dolan get in that seat of the high-richter than we suddenly have friends in high places and i love an owed favor yeah start there why not is the pillow trove still open we can try and ask there huh i know that's what i was thinking sleeping no more oskar for you should i not yeah see what you can find have i finished it i haven't finished it i'll give it to him it's fine he needs a little self confidence a little encouragement lot of great shirts in the store great shirts that's so great can we go to sleep now did you find anything good in this it doesn't really ultimately matter but i feel like that was like a toxic relationship i didn't really feel like the assassin and theo should have-- i mean he led to her death that kind of sucks did you get a book circuit judge i have this inventory sheet that i got from the baumbauchs we could use this as claims that it got stolen and hope for reimbursement this is like an order invoice that i have right no the order ledger no but in that i have an order ledger so we could claim that he never paid due and we are looking for some sort of representation to try and get our money from the baumbauchs does it say on the ledger the company that it came from does it say like from dryer supply and co me me being an asshole the timalt store house so it can be from the timalts they never paid due on the order that we sent them no they're in trostenwald timalt is from here right they are in zadash they made a shipment regardless it's just a story so we can get a bead on her right that's not bad what time is it is it early enough to where on my way there i can pick up my custom coat okay are we trying to go through the sewer we can still find the back sewer entrance have nott pop the lock and we know how to go with my coat kind of-ish we're going to have to distract them yes so into this is the sewer locked that was awesome ooh that guy is definitely arrested we're all rolling stealth 22 can i take the brown side of my newly purchased reversible coat take out my brewer's kit that i have and take a few of the bottles and fashion them to my waist a little bit awesome okay let's ask around and find where this richter lives lawrence is great worked for me before actually no let's do something else considering i already used lawrence once francis francis titmalt-- timalt not titmalt let's go super official i think it was a fundraiser last time you were up for election especially that demedan she directed us here we thought well dayana is just so sweet she would of course help us out here is the invoice from the amount due that they have not paid from the timalt store house oh my god what should i roll give me something good that's not too bad 15 and of course we would happily pay you for any type of additional services you might be able to help us out with no i don't think those were my words at all no and of course we are always willing to repay in favors while he wraps it up can i do a quick glance over her table or over her desk to see if i see any type of papers oh i thought she pulled us inside i'm sorry okay that's what we were looking for this whole time it's hard to find good help these days go guys let's go but we're assholes without power though i don't know it's less dangerous i don't know it's that harvest fest remember there's another tournament and stuff that we can enter into i mean look people in power tend to get corrupt they don't start corrupt in my opinion it doesn't matter who's sitting there as long as we get paid from it who cares yeah i guess let's head there meet up with these guys it's probably about that time yeah before we walk into the place i turn my coat inside out back to the blue it doesn't look like anyone followed us in okay fjord and i will go over is that a problem hey friend people like her make you uncomfortable you sure what about people like him people like him make you uncomfortable all right just checking he's fucking everywhere he's been following us a lot you said he was shifty a little criminal-- wait 500 from his personal stash (whispers) just under 700 breaking in that is really nice that's good you could do this some graphic design if anything i feel bad feels like they're investing a lot of money on this play if he's high-richter correct it would be super unfortunate to see someone else slide in there other than him but like you said not our problem we have a little bit of time we can still do a little bit of casing maybe go talk to the gentleman and see what he has to offer in between right a day and a night we got to go back to the tri-spire which we can do is that where lord sutan is in the tri-spire he respawned okay well at dawn we plan at dawn we plan i think we're going to have to reignite our planning thread it's time yeah dust the cobwebs off of it it's good we're going to go full ocean's nein you guys and bear claws
