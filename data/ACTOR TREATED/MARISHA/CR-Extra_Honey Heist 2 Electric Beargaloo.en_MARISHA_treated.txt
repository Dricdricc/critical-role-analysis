hello everyone and welcome to our very special one-shot edition where we are paying up on our good word for you guys that donated so much to our 826la charity drive a few months ago top of the year whenever that was anyway here it is welcome to the game i'm a little nervous i'm going to say the title of the game that's going to be my line to go into it come on always a director anyway 826la is-- oh shit sorry 826la-- (laughter) it is very nerve wracking okay here we go 826la is an amazing charity that we support that helps children-- kindergarten all the way through senior year of high school-- to learn better skills to read and write creatively they do a wonderful young authors program and they always have these amazing little stores that you can go to in their front out here in la it's the time travel mart they're great little date places as taliesin has pointed out before go check it out see if one is in your area and maybe volunteer i think that's about it without further ado let's get into honey heist 2 electric beargaloo [jazzy theme music] trinket you are sitting poutily in the foyer watching the hustle and bustle and the chaos around you as vex and percy try to rush out the door you know what this means they're leaving and you're not going with them vex walks up to you percy darling are we almost ready to go (quietly) where are you (louder) keyleth will be here at the sun tree to pick us up in five minutes (laughter) i know but i need you here to hold down the fort you are in charge while i'm gone okay i have arranged for plenty of treats while i'm gone yeah so you have to be a good boy--  no don't that's not for you okay i love you i'll see you in a week she rubs your fur and gives you a kiss (yelling) percy come on (laughter) they quickly in a flash gather their things half of a sleeve on percy's jacket as he runs out the door and the door closes behind you you're a little bit alone it's a little dark it's a little quiet whatever you want to do for a minute take this moment for yourself okay roll for bear you have to roll a d6 equal to or lower than your current bear stat ooh okay so you're a little bit frustrated you can't find them i don't think they're actually-- --here yet so move one point from criminal into bear as you decide to move into the pantry back into the cupboard you're looking around as you step out you try to go downstairs into the basement into the cellar and a light clicks on little torch (laughter) magic torch sitting there in an awesome blue blazer power suit is tova from the high bear nation she crosses her legs she has red lipstick and she looks at you and she goes oh hello mama's bear long time no see yeah seven months actually almost eight but who's counting look the high bear nation is in need and you-- and whatever that team was that you had six or so months ago-- you're our last resort oh i know i was waiting for the perfect time look i'll make sure we have a representative here watching over the place while you're gone nothing will happen but i need you to go get the gang back together look here's the deal remember those ninja bears that kind of crashed into that cellar yeah me too they're representatives of the bear acuda we have gotten word that their leader hattori bongo-- (laughter) it is tal'dorei's largest honey depot it is owned by the government it's also known as fort lox (stifled laughter) now look we've seen a few people go in there and they haven't come back we've sent a few of our own and the only person that we have gotten information back from is through one message spell a man named kody kody yak apparently hattori bongo is trying to make fort lox his new criminal headquarters this means there have been no shipments of honey coming in or out of the fort no shipments of honey means no delivering of honey means well it just means no honey i feel like that's pretty clear so i figure with your interests in the slayer's cake and the good work that you did last time maybe you would be down to help us i promise i will put my best men that are under you because i would have sent them into fort lox but they're not that good but they're good enough to babysit a house sure yeah i'll take you out back she steps out and she gives a whistle which i'm not going to do because i'm not very good at it you see a couple bears stand up out of the bushes didn't even see them before one tips his head roll for bear yeah they seem good enough they look tough they look like guys who you probably wouldn't want to meet in a back alleyway or a back forest or behind a tree or wherever bears hang out i've caught a little bit of word that they've been hanging out in the woods just north of here actually yeah we have informants everywhere we keep an eye out on everybody and look this is a risky task i'd like you to go ahead and clear out all of the bear acuda's clan that has rested in there including hattori bongo either get him to surrender or kill him i don't care if you do this you can take ten percent of whatever honey stock is left in fort lox if you fail well say goodbye to any income from the slayer's cake i guess she pulls out her kind of big awesome thick muscular hands (impressed noises) what's that uh-huh oh yeah she works out you can tell with that tova slips out wishes you farewell says check in with me when you're done i'll be waiting nearby feel free to do anything you want to prepare okay so you're raiding vex's closet all right go ahead and roll for criminal as you're kind of stealing from mom's wallet right now okay ooh okay you look around you don't find anything move from bear to criminal unfortunately it looks like she has packed all of her remaining bags to take to dalen's closet and a lot of her wardrobe seems to be gone as well she's really cleaned out her closet okay you make your way downstairs to percy's workshop room you try and trigger the door a little bit and it seems to be locked you know where the silverware is no problem roll for criminal you've seen percy go in and out quite a bit you know how to open this and you just simple latch it's like a cat who knows how to open the bathroom door you go downstairs you take a look around you find some rope pretty easily what else were you looking for roll for i don't know what would this be searching bear it's so hard there's only two stats it's probably criminal right you don't find any chains or any weaponry the one thing that you do find though is a potion that was sitting on the wall brian and everything else seems to be properly locked up in a very well protected gun locker with the key very well hidden okay any last things you want to look for it's pretty dark when vex and percy left it was already getting right at sunset they were trying to get a head start on the time zones you know catch that red eye anyway make your way do a bear sense as you go into the woods you don't find anybody you look for a few hours after a while does someone else want to make a bear sense okay roll a d6 just one every one of you have things that you are good at trinket you're a grizzly you're good at terrifying things if you're good at something you get to roll twice and take the lower you basically have advantage that is a one okay as you're looking for honey you think you hear something in the woods you're thinking maybe hyenas or coyotes coming up you are all together as a group yeah you hear some twigs snapping under what's clearly a very heavy weight about this time trinket comes out of the woods very frustrated very irritated and a little tired okay roll for bear he slaps you you all head to the banks of the river and find the cache of bamboo that vex has been slowly working on growing as you talk and figure out your plans we're going to roll for roles you're the face i love it you can be the same thing if you want i'm going to say your choice you're the brains the face and the brains cookie and waffle peddy tuxpin you're the driver liam las vegas has taught you quite a bit over the past seven months he got his license revoked the thief all right liam las vegas looking for a one or a four all right roll for bear i think with advantage okay you successfully chill out a little bit i would say you take one point from bear to criminal calm down a little bit you guys are planning currently but yeah if you want to take it to voluntarily move a point i'll allow it that's true if you want you can move a point from bear to criminal it's voluntarily you can voluntarily move a point from bear to criminal if you all choose to take a criminal planning sequence flashback that's up to you guys if you're feeling like you're on the brink it's voluntarily so up for whoever wants to be a part of it if you are getting pretty high on criminal you can move a point from criminal to bear by eating a shitload of honey yeah you all currently have no honey you forgot to pick that up that's actually true you are still close to the castle if you wanted to backtrack you could okay are you leading them to the slayer's cake (laughter) you go down to the hat store knowing you you probably have written one in canon to whitestone that i don't know the name of nothin' but hats you guys head down it's pretty late it's the middle of the night nothin' hatters is not open tonight trinket is so cocky i love it okay waffle why don't you roll for criminal to keep watch and you roll for criminal to try and pick the lock you move a point into bear because you are frustrated with that you hear (knocking) ey ey what are you do-- aww fucking bears again git git it sounds a lot like the same guards from last time oh this one's been getting into the brew stash git git on yes there is back in the alleyway behind the hattery a wagon it is not it's by itself it is unhitched trying to do a drive by pick up and run thing okay roll two take the lowest because this is your specialty as this guard is poking at you with his javelin situation you see this giant panda peddy tuxpin (thudding footsteps) from behind pulls up with the wagon they're pretty big and probably have more coming roll two take the lowest you should all always have six points that go back and forth okay about that time the guys drop their javelins they take off running i'd say you have a little bit of time but there will now be reinforcements your presence is known roll for bear with advantage (crashing) your shoulder goes right into the iron brace bar right across it stone pavers about this time you guys are hearing more clickity clackity of guards running up that's what he just tried to do okay yeah sure yeah roll twice take the lowest why not i'm curious to see what happens for criminal okay you get enough of a running jump and as you turn you get a nice section this big or so that crashes through you splinter the door inward i don't think any of you could fit through with the exception of liam las vegas come here they're over here come on charlie okay it's like a vending machine just hats you guys catch about that you get a pretty good stack and you guys-- --see the guards coming up running okay peddy as you take off there's some guards who try to flank you coming around the other side roll for driver to try and get around them you're like i can totally make it i can totally make it ooh it's getting narrower as i'm getting closer roll twice take the lower for criminal oh god and that's pretty much exactly what happens you go through some of the edges of the cart start shattering off you guys who were riding roll for bear to see if you can hold on oh god peddy you are oblivious you keep running the three of you fall off and the guards are catching up to you what do you do roll twice for criminal take the lower okay you have six points right yeah you're good your success if you succeed you get more greedy and you move one from bear into criminal yes when the plan goes off without a hitch move one point from bear into criminal the guards stop were those bears hurting you good sir you must be a tourist i am so sorry that you had to experience that in our wonderful city we're really trying to get our animal control into a respectable situation here sir and he pulls out a little welcome to whitestone patch we like to give this out to some of our favorite tourists okay sir uh thank you so much and he turns and walks away he half-understands you you guys that fell off you gather the hats that fell off the back of the cart following peddy into the outskirts of the city you guys all know more or less where you're meeting up after a few minutes you all convene and you all sort through your prize and get to pick which ones you guys want let's roll for hats sam and roll for hats yeah let's go this way now since yeah just give me the number and i'll tell you you get the fez okay trinket everyone's rolling a d8 for these right you get the cowboy hat hey team where did that-- oh here it is the number would've been the same thing you were destined for the cowboy hat all right peddy okay what color bowler do you want we have gray we have green we have black waffle so you also get a bowler unless you decide you want to mix it up you want the gray bowler cookie you also get a fez liam and yeah we have multiple of a few things you guys all look like members of the shriners association okay as you guys are now in the middle of the dark north of the woods of whitestone you know the direction to the 1972-acre woods it'll probably take you an hour and a half you also have the entire guard and everyone out looking for you roll twice take the lower for brains for criminal to track down this place you feel like you remember-- you fail you don't remember where this honey is you guys take a few hours walking the edge of the rivers he was rolling for criminal and you failed so you should-- did you go-- when your plan fails and you run into difficulty you move one point from criminal into bear you didn't really run into difficulty that's true do you want to voluntarily move a point is that what you're wanting to do okay go ahead and move a point but unfortunately i'd say you don't quite remember where these beehives are if anyone else wants to search okay it probably takes you about 45 minutes now-- since you guys had walked a little bit up the river looking for these-- to get back the guards stop you who's this guy all right he steps out of the way you go in you look around you go to the pantry it's pretty easy-- you only find two jars there's not a lot there but i'd say there's two uses you gather your stuff-- anything else roll for-- what is searching is searching for bear like a bear then roll for bear you destroy the kitchen you knock over a coat rack-- one of those freestanding coat racks that was standing yeah it was a pretty bad idea it falls over and this big long trenchcoat falls over you and you go eh might be useful i don't know mm-hmm the brains is there okay you guys gather your stuff you meet the rest of the sweet brothers at the edge of the forest and you slowly start making your way towards the 1972-acre woods it's a little bit of a trek-- it takes you the rest of the evening by the time that you get there the sun is rising wait for it as you the approach this clearing in the woods you can hear soft music in the distance a string quartet rich smells of cured meats and cheeses waft past your nose that are immediately counterbalanced with saccharine sweet maple honey and cinnamon scents as well as the very coveted-- you can tell this is coveted grade-a honey this isn't the cheap shit following where your senses are leading you you all begin to see blush-colored roses and wild daisies draping from nearby trees an old and opulent brick and wooden manor reveals itself in the dense forest treeline and the full picture starts becoming a little bit more clear a beautiful courtyard gated in iron-wrought fencing is spotted with several tables being dressed with tablecloths and matching floral centerpieces to the rose and daisy garlands you saw upon entering several bears in aprons skitter around as they set up for what appears to be a wedding server bears they're bears a dessert table is being adorned with honey cakes the bar has copper mugs with bamboo stir sticks being placed you all have made it to vinnie the pooh's manor okay liam las vegas and cookie-- opulent very victorian sitting room as you walk in you go up the stairs that are red-carpeted opulent paintings on the side of the wall you know where vinnie's office is you go down a long hallway-- at the end with the giant double oak doors as you all approach you see another man with dark slicked-back hair in a suit come out bear man liam didn't expect to see you coming around here boss is in an interesting mood go on in you open the door and you in the dark heavily-lit with only a window coming through see a portly golden-brown-furred bear with thick black hair slicked back and a thin pencil mustache on his fur (laughter) ah liam liam las vegas it's been a long time since i've seen you they're doing okay you know my daughter she's getting married today it's interesting for you to come here on the day my daughter is to be married interesting you know that's hard to believe seeing as you don't even come by anymore don't even stop in for coffee you don't even have the respect to call me the pooh you know what do you want liam well that's very interesting it's interesting that you think you have more information than the pooh you know is that why you're here with this other wise guy you think you can do better than me you think he knows more than vinnie call me vinnie the pooh i don't know you you know you don't give me respect yet it's a very blessed day i worked very hard for those extra nine hundred and-- one thousand-- i worked very hard for those other acres (laughter) you know you have a very good point liam las vegas i'm sorry to be so testy tell me what you know what can i do for you one of the best you're talking about the bear acuda yeah brian chupacabra and come to find out there's this guy hattori bongo you heard of him well you know on top of moving all the honey he also controls the underground xhorhasian smoked salmon smuggling grounds i actually ordered a bunch of salmon from him for my daughter's wedding and it hasn't showed up yet it's been a little delayed i don't know why i heard something like that too i didn't know if it was true i don't like that there's only one pooh look you know i like you liam but you're not necessarily part of the family and you-- and i don't know you so look i'll tell you something you go up you go check in on my smugglers that are trying to bring in the xhorhasian smoked salmon you find out what's going on you come back let me know i can trust you and then maybe i'll give you the information you know you can't just come in here and ask me to be a snitch you know that's not vinnie all right the wedding ceremony starts in about three hours well i sent them northeast up on the path just right behind the house i expected them to be back around four hours ago that's the path that leads straight up to fort lox the same path see what you can find and then we'll talk okay kiss the rings oh i like you i like this guy you know how about this you go get yourself one of our premium honey cocktails themed after the bride and groom you know these weddings these days and get yourself one for the road all right okay okay you go back down and you are chilling in the courtyard feel free to go get-- the guests haven't arrived it's very much still getting set up so you can go in if you want when liam las vegas and cookie-- this is very confusing-- come back down you let him know that you can go in and get a cocktail get some honey get some bamboo you're welcome to it if you would like brian and you have the good graces of the pooh so it's not open bar but you can have enough if you would like to move a point from criminal onto bear you are more than welcome to do that feel free to pocket bamboo some honey okay okay go ahead and roll for criminal you take another two servings or so of honey you can use them for the cocktail looks at you oddly and then goes yeah okay and hands it over okay feel free so make your move you can move a point from criminal into bear if you want to okay you pocket a few sticks for later oh okay you walk up and she's busy and she's setting the table yes what can i help you hi oh really the whitestone and vix'squalia oh my god what's it like living in a castle that sounds pretty nice really well who do i say when i-- who requested me when i show up ask for trinket it's high noon she makes a note and she slips you another jar of honey just for yourself actually the woman who cookie was just talking to was moving over champagne glasses placing them onto the table and they're behind her a little bit she's distracted it's an unattended drink cart okay roll for criminal roll twice because you're the driver take the lower you slowly (creaking) pull it away you all meet out front of vinnie the pooh's house you're all going northeast you hop on the drink cart you all hop on the drink cart it's a comedic scene it looks like a clown car but it's a bear car and right on top of that pyramid is liam las vegas surfing on the shoulders poor peddy pushing behind it's true you don't necessarily travel any faster after not too long maybe two hours you start to head to the edge of the woods and you get to a clearing that's opening up you can actually see in the very far distance stone fort walls as you head up you start to hear some shouting and arguing in the distance sounds like an altercation in bear as you all get quiet you hear look man if you're not with us then that means you must be against us all right come on you see the outline of three polar bears and beyond that vinnie the pooh's guys and a cart you know man you don't want to sign a petition you don't want to hear us out you don't want to play our game you know it's just not fair a hundred yards the polar bears and you can hear vinnie the pooh's guys being like look we just want to cross we're in a hurry we don't want to take your survey and we don't want to donate any money we don't care everyone stops and turns around oh hey hey do you guys have a minute to talk to the polar rising no you know what man we're the ones being harassed all the time no one wants to sit here no one cares about the polar bears look i'm sorry we're just really passionate about our cause you know we've been trying to get the polar rising off the ground for quite a while and no one even wants to (stuttering) talk and-- look i can't even talk i'm so upset you do look like half us like exactly half it's pretty cool man brother from another mother look we're just trying to raise awareness that polar bears aren't weak okay the media's always depicting us as these helpless creatures stuck on this floating piece of frozen water and that makes us look weak man you know and then they want to talk about how we're not reproducing as much as we can be have you ever tried having sex in the middle of fucking frigid temperatures man it's hard right your dick it just doesn't work right and i feel like-- everyone's criticizing our dicks man then the other guys go yeah stop criticizing our dicks the other guy goes yeah stop hammering on and criticizing our dicks that's because it's not just below freezing man exactly they're always hammering this idea that our dicks just aren't good enough just stop hammering our dicks call me chief of polar rising no you're totally right man we learned that a few months ago sitting here collecting signatures that didn't do nothing the high bear nation don't want to listen to our cause council of tal'dorei doesn't want to listen our cause it's a real problem just getting stuck on this floating frozen water shit so we thought maybe to bring awareness to our problem we'd make a game brian and yeah a game very politically-driven social awareness game so all we're doing is we're out here we're trying to have it beta-tested because we can't test it because we're alphas so we're looking for betas to try and test our game give us some feedback well you want to see it well look if you'll just take a look-- well how else am i going to get the game out of the box it's not a dick-in-a-box it's a game-in-a-box see you're hammering our dicks again is that true all right i want respected opinions here you know from educated people these guys don't even want to listen you know that looks clear that's why we'll never go into alpha testing with our game only beta all right hang on so whoever breaks the polar bear off the floating piece of water first wins but you can't hammer our dicks okay you're playing don't break the frozen water but you're not allowed to hammer the dicks the first team-- sorry we'll do team one and team two first team that makes the polar bear fall into the frozen water and gives him a complex loses well you can't hammer the dicks no if a dick falls that's no one's fault and that's what we're trying to communicate but if you hammer our dicks you're immediately disqualified and you lose unfortunately no isn't it depressing all right who wants to go first he's half polar bear that's why yep that's bryce's dick don't hammer it yeah that's bryce bryce goes hey 'sup man no this is good game testing good to see what the trolls of the game will do you know oh if you lose the game then you just lose the game we're looking for honest and constructive criticism no we just want your feedback yeah yeah that's what i've been saying man yeah what do you mean are you kidding me no one can get into fort lox it's impenetrable not like our mates well we have an extra cart that we're using to haul all of our games are you willing to distribute our games if we give you the cart yeah would you be willing to do that because you know we've got the creative side but we don't have the publishing side man you know what you've got a deal brother from another mother polar rising yeah not the dicks careful that one's chad's yeah bryce take notes you taking these notes okay bryce write that down the person who knocks in the polar bear first loses or the first person who smacks a dick yeah sure wait you can lose dicks you just can't hammer dicks you just came from a wedding sam and you serious man chad bryce you hear that man i appreciate your guys' gentleness and candor with keeping the dicks on the board for as long as possible smells like carcinogens and plastic we bought it in the children's toy aisle that is literally the block of ice that's holding up the polar bear man you got close to our dick but i think you're all right i'll let my brother from another mother pass taped no that's the thing he's floating on he's on a four by four he's on a two by two he's hanging by a thread that's true you can do that oh god it's vibrating all over at least in the temperate weather we have a chance i hope you liked our game everybody do you feel like it really brought the full feeling of being a polar bear floating on a piece of frozen water thank you well thank you guys so much i feel like we really learned a lot from this experience here we made little stickers for anyone that says 'i'm an honorary member of polar rising feel free to take our cart and thank you thank you for everything don't break the frozen piece of block the bear's floating on don't break the frozen water okay that's good write that down bryce write that down we'll do that on our second printing thank you guys and they let you go you start your way back thanks man we'll see you at the wedding and as you guys start making your way back to vinnie the pooh's we're going to take a break don't hammer our dicks true it's a good message it's hard to have more than one cause okay enjoy this quick break and so will we we'll be back you know what a face is right oh wait are we rolling hi everyone and welcome back to honey heist 2 electric beargaloo okay we're just going to go we're just going to jump right into it yeah yeah we're resuming the game and not just the tap as you guys make your way back to the 1070-- 9072 acre wood you approach vinnie the pooh's house and you can see preparations on the wedding have progressed quite a bit even a few guests are starting to straggle in and you make your way back up to vinnie the pooh well whoever wants to go you go in vinnie turns around in his chair and he goes oh liam i see you delivered on the goods pretty good good job man my guys got back a few hours ago just in time for the ceremony it was some of the freshest that i've ever tasted in my life you do good work i'm glad i can trust you boys that's good to know you guys are part of the pooh family now well i'm the pooh but you're part of the family well look you know it's fort lox you can't walk up right up to the front door they won't let you in you'll be killed immediately but i can tell you that when i was smuggling for good ol' hattori bongo there's a tunnel entrance about 500 yards north of the fort if you look for it directly north of the fort in the woods you'll find a little hole with a little cave entrance not really you have to know where to go it's a moderate size doorway you'll be fine cookie my daughter was hoping for a temperate partly-cloudy wedding and i think the gods will bless us today on the day of her wedding well look you know this is hattori bongo we're talking about there's going to be guards he's not a stupid bear there's probably going to be guards guarding the little secret entrance but from what i remember there's always a five-digit code that he changes every two days or so to make sure no one gets wise on the code you know what i mean people like to leak stuff i don't know i can tell you it's some alternating two-- five-digit code between salmon and bamboo so i'd be on the lookout sam and that's the only thing i ever heard when i overheard some of his guys talking about it yeah that's all i know that's going to be your best way in i don't know i know hattori bongo never runs with less than eight or so guys but if he's taken over a small fort who knows sounds like a pretty big job he's trying to pull pleasure to meet you trinket welcome to the family no i don't know of this mr yak that you're talking about but may god be with him today on the day of my daughter's wedding it's a blessed day you know well my daughter she's getting ready to be married today is her wedding day so proud i didn't think of a pun for this um finding flaws in my narrative it's a man and he's probably banging one of the bridesmaids right about now happens in the movie all right be on your way (laughter) that happened you're welcome okay if you're passing back through feel free to stop by the reception get yourself a cocktail that's an excellent question you know he's a very smart man very (slurred) ruthless that's what i said i still don't hear a problem he worked his way up i knew hattori bongo back when he was just a lackey for the bear acuda i heard about six months or so ago he (slurred) worked his way up the ranks no problem godspeed on your journey on this blessed day (laughter i heard they keep some very special prize honey up at fort lox some rare shit there's some good stuff you know if you find something keep in mind your good ol' friend vinnie the pooh yeah oh there's-- hm there's honey all over the fort (laughter) thank you good sirs oh thank god i didn't expect to talk that much as vinnie some nice blush colored roses and daisies there's nice wooden chairs with furniture legs it's more of a daytime wedding sure there was a string quartet you roll to see if you can steal one you roll to see if you can find explosives no you see cookie go up to the string quartet and as he's about to reach for the violin he trips over the tambourine set up and causes a big distraction and at this point-- --you look behind one of the folding screens where they're stashing a bunch of stuff and you do find a crate filled with a few small sparklers bottle rocket-y things nothing too crazy something that would look good on instagram that's what you found okay roll for criminal being good at thieving to look for things you look around there's a lot of people in tuxes it's a lot of pink (sighs) it's hard to say there's also a lot of-- this crowd is already shady-looking being that it is happening at vinnie the pooh's mm-hmm okay you now have pocket salmon outside afternoon reception you get on the cart and you go back north the way that you came when you ran into the polar rising it takes you another hour or so and you crest into the opening the clearing which leads into a valley where you see in the distance fort lox you all-- taking a wide berth around the fort-- head north does someone want to roll to search to see if they can find the hidden entrance i'd say roll for bear since you're sniffing and searching you're tracking a little bit you're having a hard time into bear yes okay you have an advantage on sensing honey so you roll for advantage-- oh you're honey bears so both of you roll-- and you roll to see if you can see any structures or doors okay and wait to see-- at the same time you all get the waft of honey it's a little bit tough because there's honey all over the place being that you are near fort lox it's hard to discern what is wafting in from behind you but with the help over here of liam las vegas you get this sweet draft coming about-- not too much-- 50 feet in the woods not far from you guys as you walk closer to the door you see sleeping propped up against it a ninja bear a member of the bear acuda looks a little dozy he's not anticipating anything being a bad guard okay roll with advantage because you are a thief and you're stealthing i guess oh god so yeah you get more frustrated as a bear as you're trying to lumber back you don't really anticipate how dense honey badgers are-- that squeezing of liam las vegas's thighs around your midsection squeezed out a fart about this time it's not the sound that alerts the guard it's the smell and he (sniffing) huh and spots the two of you you're not far you're ten feet away from him okay roll for bear you have advantage because of carnage oh muscle and carnage how'd you fail oh shit well you get more frustrated because your plan failed and you get a point in bear as you're gauging the trajectory of your jump i'm going to do this awesome flying leap and as you fly you just fly right past him faceplant fascinating roll for criminal i'm going to say i don't know how stealthy you're being for this success peddy roll for bear with advantage as you leap at him your crazed panda claws and your soft demeanor is totally off-putting and you go right for this guy's throat you succeed that's gory and impressive brian and you're doing okay you're holding on but the taste of meat after you're so recently trying to cut back is a little rough you now have the corpse of a bear acuda member okay roll for criminal he is you are a little too nauseous you throw up a little bit and you have to step away okay you strip you take his clothes as you search him you guys end up finding in one of the pockets-- no one thus far no you seem to be alone waffle as you turn around as you're looking at this you see this wooden door that's carved into the side of a hill encased in stone a little bit reinforced with some paving and on the side there's a little keypad box with a cover over top of it there are two buttons one's a salmon and one's bamboo and there's a little led screen up top okay all right bleep bleep (door unlocking) you do look like a ninja and shit it's pretty awesome once you're in you see this long corridor that stretches almost as far as you can see into the darkness lining it are dilapidated crates and broken glass many of which have honey oozing out you also see a few wheelbarrow wheels cartwheels a few broken down wheelbarrows and carts themselves okay i'll say each one of you make a check with advantage since you're all doing your skills this isn't a bear thing this is a criminal thing yeah okay i'm just going to do two out of three you're a little bingey still a little tweaky yeah you're doing okay with what you know about carts and motorcycles you're able to figure it out and luckily with percy as your patron saint right now matt and quincy de bolo quincy with a bolo yeah it's that guy that we all know and love it is not motorized you all have to pedal though flintstones style all in a line mm-hmm it's a long corridor you guys have to-- in about that time-- (laughter) as you guys reach a fork in the corridor the very abrasive noise you were making alerts two ninjas and they drop down okay las vegas is taking the one on the right there's a fork so there's two guarding each corridor las vegas is taking the one on the right roll with advantage for your carnage this is bear you're going full-- ugh okay you get more frustrated take a point in bear poor las vegas the bears are just too quick they saw you coming and one of them goes (kicking) and punts las vegas out of the way okay are you taking the one that liam's taking okay roll-- what was your skill honey sense but you're the brains roll for criminal i think you ping one right off the top of his head you papercut his eyes a little bit and he's like ow what how ugh you got me right in the eye roll for bear as he is holding his eye he goes (grunting) it's like a three stooges movie he goes down he's not taken out but he is a little incapacitated okay while you do that what are you doing peddy flashback (warbling) (slowly) only when the temperature's below average you have a board game piece at the one that he's attacking okay roll for criminal back to bear these are crazy bears he goes (pinging) wax on then he's looking right at you trinket you've downed your honey roll twice for terrify he goes (whimpering) and you feel a little warmth on your paw you may and you have advantage as he is pinned and for your carnage with that trinket all you see is his eyes go (popping) a little bit as two of liam las vegas's claws go up through the back of his head and into his sinuses a little bit of tears of blood come streaming down his face he (chokes) and slumps down he slumps down you still have one more on you guys' side that was awesome wait what okay and go for questioning is that what you said okay roll for bear you bear hug him right around his throat and he just oh god he collapses right down you are on-- yes success move from bear to criminal it's like a wrestling pose you are right on top and he's stuck whatever you want to do look man there's a few safes all around but hattori's moved most of it to his own office and his own personal stash okay you're going to go down this left passageway you're going to get to your first right you're going to take that-- left passageway your first right second left at the end of that corridor you'll see his hideout he is what what okay i don't know what that means just don't kill me will you not tell just don't tell bongo about this okay okay look i don't know if you guys are with that yak guy but i didn't hurt him okay i wasn't the one who-- yeah he's alive okay you know how you go down that left corridor and you take that right and then there was the second left if you keep going past that second left and you keep going all the way down there's two more rights you're once again going to take that second right yeah he's not far though it's just two doors down yeah okay thank you it's a big fort can i run away and will you guys not say anything (choking) we got three ninjas okay you guys have plenty of honey that you have stocked up on so if anyone-- yeah if you eat a lot of honey you move a point from criminal to bear you head down the left corridor you take the first right you're coming up and you take that second left and you keep going you're going to kody yak's or you're going to hattori bongo the first-- kody yak okay you keep going past you have a little debate and then you go past a cell a little door as you pull up you hear someone go is someone there i hear something that's not my name anymore yeah that's me they changed my name to wagyu yeah i don't know i feel like i'm their prized meat no they're just been training me to help hattori bongo are you with tova okay please if you let me out i'll help you i'll help you fight him (clanging) (muffled clanging) roll for thief lock picking with a few blows you eventually bend the lock to where you can get in out steps this man who's been half in the bear acuda colors the scraps tied around him giant horns he's a yak he's definitely a big yak he comes out he's hunched but as he straightens as he gets out of the cell you can see that on his hind legs he stands about your guys' height but he seems a little bigger with the giant yak horns no not really i like grassy things yeah it's a little sweet for me but i like it all right shaking he desperately shoves it in his face he's been training me he's got these code words i don't know i could never remember them i just go blind i just go after them and he's been trying to make these new contraptions i don't know i think they're around here somewhere i don't know there's stuff hidden all over the place i'd never seen anything like them before no they make loud booming noises they're shiny and people use them-- he leads you down that first corridor that you guys passed to get to him you go wrap around to the right and you see the storage room that's filled with crates make a search you're going to have to destroy the crates first so i'd say make a bear check with advantage for carnage you make a straight roll for bear luckily liam las vegas just tears into the first one with full-on alcoholic rage just gnaws the corner off it's crazy as you tear into the first crate that you find you find tiny shiny things you open a little bit of a box and you find not a lot of it looks functional but you find one shiny ball there are a few more crates okay roll for bear unfortunately waffle you try to punch a crate and it's a little too hard for you roll for bear this one that you're going after crushes in you succeed so you go from bear to criminal succeeding goes from bear to criminal failing goes from criminal to bear no matter the stat you roll as the crate breaks in you feel this thing jam up right into your left cheek it's like a pipe-shaped thing there's a few more crates you guys can search if you want roll for criminal you get a little more frustrated you move a point from criminal to bear as you don't have the opposable thumbs to dexterously enough-- roll for bear you successfully are a maternal bear you mama bear suck the splinter-- you find a case of the shiny rollies so you have a couple more (whispers) that's just right there are like two more crates left that you guys haven't messed up with okay you take one you take the other you have advantage you roll for bear oof man you get a little bit more frustrated each of you feel free to-- do you want to sit on one more okay you open it and there's one of these shiny rolly balls in its own separate case and it's got a stamp on the side and a little bit of this magical aura to it wait i did the exact same thing that i did to you last time i gave you the wrong one okay roll for bear okay i was going to say because you're pretty frustrated you crack it open and you find the remaining bullets i mean roly balls kody yak goes you got to be careful you know he's got a lot of people hiding around here he's got us all at his fingertips he can destroy anything you seem deeply convincing look like a bear that's seen a lot you guys lead the way-- kody is coming he's a little shaken and disturbed-looking but he goes down and follows you guys as you guys approach the inconspicuous door it's a stark opposite from what you guys just experienced at vinnie the pooh's a little hidden a little inconspicuous it looks like any other of the fort lox doors in front of it the brains has a point this appears to be according to the directions hattori bongo's room you can roll with advantage for criminal okay you pull out your corn cob-shaped skewers the thinnest ones that you could find you go in there-- ting don't-- calm you focus after you felt one little pin go and-- (clicking) you're going to have to crank the turn wheel i will count that as a-- if anyone wants to a do a flashback planning you can and move if anyone wants to down any honey you can move one point voluntarily at this time or bear to criminal if you want to down honey or yeah you know what i mean if you want to move a point you can yeah i'm considering his little pre-planning just now a flashback the gun in the first act it's a heavy iron door but with your terrifying rage you immediately slam it open you see it's a small room but there's a big window which is odd because you haven't seen a lot of windows it seems to be a mysterious misplaced window in front of it in a long cloak slicked-back hair he turns around big black bear white around his mouth big brown eyes that looks at you oh hello trinket i've been watching all of you sweet brothers right welcome i'm assuming you guys are here trying to overthrow me right hmm we'll see about that i just want to say you need to think about anything that you want to do from here on out because i have this he pulls out a little tiny vial with a little fleck of crystallized sugar that has congealed in the bottom left-hand corner of the bottle we know all of your weaknesses all of them now that's not what we're after this here this is balootonium oh come on you all think that the harvest fest was just about controlling the honey trade is that right you fools we were after that crazed man the little bald one with three fingers he's the secret we've managed to cultivate this balootonium a highly-concentrated explosive of pure nitro-honey all of westruun if i have to yeah it's actually quite densely sweet so sweet just the touch of other molecules aside from its own will make you explode and blow your head into a million pieces well this right here can demolish all of this fort if i wanted to you will definitely die no-- any introduction of outside atoms like water will cause a quick chemical reaction and you all explode very quickly i've thought of of all about this i have plans don't try to brain-drain me you're not going to get my plans i'm just saying if i drop this you all explode no it's (emphasis) baloo baloo-nium there are a lot of deep-layered puns in this entire game no i'm asking you to fight and at that time-- hattori bongo-- --exposes himself yeah i've put a ninja mask-- as he drops down two of his lackeys drop down in front of him here's a ninja bear missed with that first pop kakoof did you hit him no it went wide i'll give you that i'll give you one you get a ball back with that first explosive round and then that second explosive round as you fire two rapid shots pow pow from your rifle kody yak has blood vessels pop in his eyes he enrages as that seems to be the cue and he turns against you kody yak is now a ninja bear what are you going to do about it what are you going to do-- oh my god i'm only counting hits so you've hit him twice no i'm now solely counting hits okay roll with advantage under criminal you can roll for criminal i think success as he is distracted he's like ha aw with that kody yak trips he is down temporarily on the floor floundering the ninjas are still up though roll for criminal they go wide they pop in the corner these are ninjas they're used to explosives they've already been expended the ones that he has one more oh he is still up you just have to hit him hang on the strange flashback music playing you steady your focus you think about-- (loud cheering) (laughter) it hits him and upon impact you see the blue cascading energy course around him it crackles inwards and he explodes into a thousand pieces with the energy of the ten-plus powerful bullets okay it was from a list of passions and he just ran out of passions and made a potion he just stole a d&d fireball roll this under your criminal thief stat with advantage oh shit it crashes it kills them instantly well you're full criminal so i'm going to say roll four dice 14 points is plenty it singes their hair these are like three hit point bears there are no points he had three hits (explosions) you see flames lick out of the front door of the corridor you guys run down further the left over gunpowder you hear (popping) like someone threw-- you turn down the left corridor (motorcycle imitations) you're the driver you're guiding so i'd say you feel the heat coming behind you trinket you've got the nitro-honey in your hand-- oh no you hear a little bit of popping and shrapnel coming up from behind you and a piece of crate gets caught in the spoke wheels of the bike (shouting) roll for-- you're going to have to roll for criminal you auto-success that's right you chase after him okay you guys had made it through that fork in the road where that main-- you came down that right corridor and there's that main stretch of corridor towards the exit so that means trinket you go up the right way up the fork in the corridor you guys had not been down there is so much honey you can i would say all of you make rolls yes you get advantage just roll for bear as you're running after him you catch up to him okay you roll for criminal you roll-- you auto-succeed on everything no you're good you're good i would say you roll for bear-- muscle with advantage to see if you get in you are successfully honey-waterboarding as you wake up you see cookie at your testicles doing a little speed boxing routine as liam las vegas says that trinket you realize you do not have the balootonium you guys find so much honey you find some rare honey a rare black lotus honey that is valued at quite a lot you find more balootonium some bamboo as some of the bear acuda were pandas but not as much as the honey there doesn't seem to be as much of a market for it kody is definitely dead with that as you all scoop up your spoils tova comes in and graciously congratulates all of you you all are adorned with accolades and honey for life you all get new suits you are hired members of the high bear nation for whenever you feel like working and that is where we will end today's honey heist 2 electric beargaloo thank you you guys were amazing what was it don fontaine don lafontaine was his name though or was it the
