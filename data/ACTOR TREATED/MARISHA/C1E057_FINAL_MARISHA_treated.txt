all right (laugh) okay hang on we know it's here there aren't that many white dragons walking around-- certainly not anymore we know it's here why don't we sleep on it think about it if we're ever in a pinch for money we can come back oh wait vanessa wait that's me where's the temple of the raven queen okay bye we should drink those to be fair percy you do a lot to remind us to try not to forget that you're titled those are probably bad good idea i like that percy do you still have that raven's skull i gave you all right oh i was going to say giving sorry angry i'm not here i can not today but i can over time yeah yeah yeah he's just not home sorry guys victor's on vacation (whispering) hey pike (whispering) i think vax is talking to himself yeah it's gorgeous it's very intimidating do you know anything about this you've lived here for a while pike never been in can we recognize the language in which the runes come from what did you say the name was of the raven queen's temple again raven's crest okay i turn to vex i swear to you we're all coming out of here alive but if like an hour passes and we don't maybe come in but we're all coming out of here alive so don't worry about it it's fine we've faced way more terrifying things than a few albeit creepy men in robes it's dark like an interrogation room like one-way mirror type of thing do i get the sense as a druid as an ashari that we've switched into another plane oh i rolled a 19 (laughs) 21 oh goodness gracious do you need anything before you go in any enhancement of any kind okay i just kind of squeeze his hand we're right out here on the other side of this door if anything terrible happens you have the earpiece no one will stop pike and i from getting through there if something terrible goes wrong rules be damned i guess we'll wait yeah i stand at the bottom of the stairs and i watch i walk over you look well what did she say to you did she speak to you at all (shocked laugh) do you believe is that what she told you that this was fate why i don't know as someone who is constantly questioning mine i don't think i'm the right person to ask but i do know one thing-- and i grab his hands-- you were amazing and talented and special way before she found you if anything we can call her a god we can also call her a great opportunist she didn't give you anything special the vax that i see before me right now is no different than the vax that i saw before me ten minutes ago i'm not saying that what you experienced wasn't real and true i believe you whole-heartedly is it what was meant to be or what you just really wanted and it found you he talked to her they didn't let us in the room we stood outside he didn't talk much about it maybe you can find out more all he said was that he knows that this was fate oh yeah well that's one way of looking at it (giggles) is that riegel (giggles) yes yes is it like one of those old-school leather helmets oh football yeah okay cool yes (laugh) yeah (laughs) i'm so excited for the art (laugh) that's like another 12 inches to you you look so tall oh yeah go go go go pike go go yeah he might have saw the face of a god yeah ritual communion oh no taliesin please inspire oh my god it's a 10 i get excited sorry plus 10 oh sure i was thinking go-go-gadget finger that's right dm (laughs) (laughs) oh shit (laughs) yes yeah just give him an anime weapon and get your joe mad poster right now pre-order oh and giveaway (laughs) yeah and a high-five we did talk about the feywild one of the vestiges is in marquet hang on cabal's ruin which is a magic-devouring cloak-- (whispering) okay i'll speak quietly there's apparently a magic-devouring cloak who is being worn by the-- it's in ank'harel it's being worn by a merchant warrior with a missing eye so technically we don't even have to head towards the feywild do you guys remember how i kind of did that thing with grog's evil sword and kind of banished it away for forever no right no we're not bringing it back i can do that with the rest of us no it's not like a banishment i can plane shift us wherever we want to go to an alternate plane yeah we just hold hands and think about it really hard yeah it's druid magic it's great i can take us to where we've been before to where it's familiar very briefly it is somewhere i am familiar with i believe through means that i am familiar in general terms such as city of brass on the elemental plane of fire no if you guys want to go to the plane of fire that's like a hike and a jump through a hole all right yeah i can get us there it's very big i imagine we'll figure it out once we get there what about me team half-elf yeah question hmm okay it says the wrath of the fey warden is what we're looking for the bow and that it now acts as the heart of a cancerous tree corrupting the verdant land is there something i can do maybe try and it says offline guys i'm so glad we won dnd we beat it can i maybe sense a sick tree you know what let's go to whitestone let's go to whitestone and drop some stuff off yes they have something underground already all right bless you the water ashari live in the ozmit sea no i think they've got an island really how familiar are you with the sea a blade forged from metal pulled from the far realm it was the center of many dark rituals have i heard about an island of glass have pike or i heard of an island of glass all right i rolled a natural 1 guys water isn't glass that's stupid you rolled a 20 oh go pike team ones whoo what's the story of the shrew it was really bad you know what grog we will put that in our back pocket and we will think about it we don't need an airship when we kill all the dragons we'll buy it with all of the gold that we've stolen from all the dragons it'll be great we're going to whitestone (repeats piercing spell noise) through a tree can i do something while i'm in the tree can i do something i missed you have you heard of this whole cancerous tree situation in the feywild shh no i'm in the middle of the tree i'm in the tree aww i step out of the tree i'll talk to him later i don't know let me find it yeah he told us yeah he's got a tramp stamp oh are we all going down to the ziggurat sure aww how is whitestone finding you sure hi gilmore i give him a hug back oh before dinner i think we were all just curious on the state of the ziggurat as we were calling it spinning orb of death is what we call it all right yeah sure back to your old self i go to vex and pike and go is this a good opportunity for us to break out our formal wear okay the ladies take like 20 minutes not the feywild but maybe soon (laughing) yes yes yeah hang on what exactly did he say by the way circle back treat proposals like we do our dungeons (laughs) we circle back (giggles) i understand that i don't know if that's a good reason to say yes though yeah what is with that i didn't know that was possible i don't know yeah no and then i feel really-- right and you kind of think about it for a second and you entertain it and then you feel really gross about yourself no of course it's not gross if you're actually interested wait what i know and we've been through so many uncomfortable things together most of life is so uncomfortable be comfortable right now we understand you look so cute laura ashley and i do a little air cantrip to make the skirt poof out hey do you guys mind tying me up a bit nice and tight (grunts) (strained) no but that means it's right all right i'm good we look fabulous yes we do (laughs) 2 pm allura kima keyleth goes over and gives her a hug it's only for a few hours don't worry about it so nothing survives the transfer it is destroyed into its purest components it sounds to be fair grog i might have tried that a little i sort of stuck my hand in the spinning ball of death and let's just say i'm glad i'm still here standing with you all it did a considerable amount of damage to my hand and definitely felt like it was sucking me in and i had to resist pretty hard but it seems like anything that goes in that sphere doesn't come out the other end intact it's for their own safety yeah my choice is the unmentionables i like it the rivers are called the gilded run and the shademirk bog pours out of the tree the tree is responsible for a swampy bog joran the what so much so that she could almost pass as a druid wielding natural magic i want to kill her so hard (strained) i want her to die i mean i'm sure there is something bigger than thordak probably in the fire plane but the fire ashari closed the portal that was the portal that thordak came out of it ripped apart my entire-- well allura how did you lock him in the fire plane to begin with all right so that's all good but he did escape exactly that was my question (laughs) so these heart-stones embrace the essence of where they reside and he has the heart-stone of the fire elemental plane living inside of him a heart-stone right so you're thinking the chroma conclave was simply a temporary alliance we can use this turning them against each other is not a bad idea so we can take-- yeah do you know exactly how these heart-stones are forged oh that's right it was good to see you (laugh) (whispering) it's not great though it stands home is where you make it kima we do let's go get you a bow i have one thing i'd like to do i want to go back to our little cave that we dug out under where the sun tree is is that still there i want to go there and i want to kind of sit down and meditate for a second and i want to cast speak with plants and have a little chat with the sun tree i reach out and i touch the roots can i just kind of feel sense the arcane ley-lines that allura was talking about that the tree's in the center of okay so i just reach out touch the tree and say hey old friend how are you feeling doing better you're pretty cool sun tree hey sun tree i was just wondering if you knew-- if you could tell me anything about this terrible cancerous tree in the feywild if you knew anything about it he might be like your brother or something no no okay there's this tree in the feywild and it might have a man living in it called fenthras no sorry that's the name of the bow the bow is in it named fenthras and it might be a really sick tree can you tell me where there's a really sick tree maybe in the feywild barkeley hey sun tree you apparently kind of live in the middle of all these arcane ley-lines of the world how far do those stretch can you kind of give me a rough idea do they go to the other side of the world can you stretch all over the world who pelor right so you're not a natural tree you're a tree from the gods all right well anyway you're really awesome sun tree yeah you're so cool okay so it was good talking to you i'll walk through you soon okay bye and then i leave (snorts) (snorts) (laughs) oh my god no nooo is it a rakshasa what the fuck has he been a rakshasa the whole time wait is it the rakshasa who's different is it not gilmore so many questions liam and right why is it always you hang on wait oh wait did you get the final blow in the rakshasa in the slayer's take but he was dead what the fuck is going on no because i'm not a psycho i can see chopping someone's body up might be psycho
