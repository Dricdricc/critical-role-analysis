discount code i love that you called it a modifier and taliesin high-five there we go oh is it skeletor oh this one's a small too on this side this is a rad shirt this is dragonball right dragonball you did yeah i know i was like sounds legit sure i'd believe that well they might belong to geek and sundry but it's going to be all of us no one wants you to leave but you're leaving and i have to get on with my life is that what you just said it's hard to think about 12 things that you legitimately feel passionately about oh dibsies it's like slapstick pizza i don't know if i got a tooth count either does it turn into a pearl we have 60 pounds of scales left (laughs) i want some black and white armor how-- i want to work most of-- i want to take as much as i can-- how much did we put in about how much is 500 pounds worth of gold maybe that's a better question how much did you say was the total again so 20% would be 15000 yeah i agree we would ask an entire town to come to a decision are we sure there's people capable in town to bring back all this money that we trust i can stone shape like a little no stone shape's permanent okay okay stone shape's permanent so i could stone shape a little cubby and put a little symbol over it so we know-- we have the hunk of quall i'll go ahead and here i hand scanlan the hunk of quall it finds things with magical essences here do you want the hunk of quall do you want to hang onto it boo huh i'm covered in-- i mean i can-- hang on wait grog grog come here i cast create water and i fill the jug with water do you hear the ocean grog do you hear the ocean i scoop up a little bit of dirt and i put the dirt in the jug dump it out it's like a birthday cake shot dres vina's spellbook abjurist noja that's right see i was going to say how to win friends and influence people thank you scanlan thank you i mean i guess because i happen to be holding the vase at the time sure no you can-- you can have it no you can have the vase i'm going to continue eviscerating a dragon yeah we can make a decent amount of armor with 40 pounds-- yeah cool cool cool through walls and stuff yeah so what's that deal i go to scanlan scanlan did i hear you had a hot spring or something like that or like a spa here i feel like you'd have a spa-- because i am covered in dragon bile not no no just can you point me in the direction of the spa thank you is it a very fantastic bathhouse i go over the comms and i say hey vex pike i think i just found the new hangout spot for the ladies-- i'm in the third basement come down oh i mean shit uh this is not keyleth this is another transmission you're picking up it's-- i'll change the channel you look so intent i love the hot springs aren't they fantastic (coughs) oh wow you just said a lot of things in a very short space of time you know we just killed a dragon we just killed a dragon okay so that's about as far as i got i wasn't sure if i was going to you know live past that i wasn't sure if he was going to live past that i wasn't sure if you were going to live past that really any of us-- yeah we did we did now there's three more and i have a lot that i still have to do and still have to figure out about myself (sighs) i'm afraid what will happen if i say yes maybe will you hate me if i do you sure because i kind of thought you might for a very long time maybe we're not people who are allowed happiness and what happens if i lose either of you you've been to the other side what did you see anything is there an afterlife and death is a natural thing that happens with or without him do you believe in the gods do you believe that vax actually serves death what do you think that means for the rest of us you don't think we're just destroying everything everywhere we go (laughs) i don't know if i'm cut out to be a hero (groans) i don't know about that maybe there's another time and another place where we don't have to but now i feel like we do i cast breathing underwater on myself and i just sink to the bottom of the pool and i just stay there for a really long time at the bottom of the pool alter self yeah totally gills i can do that wha-- ow and i just let myself sink again (laughter) wait what are we doing we're doing a cannonball contest oh sure we've had a short rest right okay acrobatics check not bad 19 and in midair i use my bonus action to turn into an earth elemental i come out yeah can we refill the pool after each use is it magical enough to where we can refill the pool isn't this is detrimental to your health (shouting) percy no i don't want any part of that oh oh okay oh that one brought tears vax yeah you have to rub it on you does pike want it oh you what was the name of that tome again scanlan uh-huh no keep telling me about myself scanlan today sure i don't want to-- what i don't like wanting things i don't care you-- all right we'll think on it no oh for the next century sure i'll hold onto it for that long are we still old it would have worn off right between pike and i-- he said begrudgingly what were you going to say percy that's kind of my hesitance about it i guess i'm honestly kind of afraid of what kind of leadership things and influence it could possibly tell me i don't know i don't know i don't know you can read it scanlan that's true i know that's my-- actually my only other regret is do we want to turn scanlan into a charm nuclear weapon because that's what we'll be doing he is tell me what kind of leadership things-- who wrote that scanlan tell me what kind of leadership skills lao tsu wants to bestow upon you if there's any good ones pass them along all right sure tooth me so i do the vox machina crest and then one down who speaks draconic from westruun wait what fassbender but you have the circlet still is the gold pile trap still there it's a dwarf the fucking asshole that peaced out i do the same keyleth takes a minute to druidcraft some wildflowers around the pyre very important cannonball competition we had to get to is that with a c or a k okay kerr i like it and what's your position been in westruun okay before we start hitting him up for work probably we don't know that's not a lot i think the dragons' motives have probably shifted by now and where the dragons might not be interested in plundering anymore instead might be interested in any city that we are in but that's no secret scanlan literally hasn't said that to me in the entire three years i've known him kerr you said you were an adventurer several years ago did you have a party that you traveled with as well would we happen to know any of them allura asum but no one likes having their ass handed to them we can't be everywhere at once but that's not indefinite they'll be back but if all of the survivors are evacuating the city-- but he said some people were incapable of leaving there might be elderly and sick here that can't travel hang on hold the phone hold the phone yeah quall did want the circlet at some point it's not necessarily ours to give away selfish maybe what were you going to say pike we could leave it with wilhand actually yes we remember did you send her towards refugees but these people are prisoners here they feel like they're prisoners in their own home and that's not a home hey hey it's really important i need to tell you right now about that time i reach and grab percy's hand before he leaves the door percy percy this is giving me a lot of anxiety there's a lot of people here no there's so many people calling us heroes we're not heroes no we're not we're terrible people we're terrible people why are they telling us this oh god oh god if i have to shake one more townsperson's hand oh god i feel like i was cursed i was cursed i don't want any of this i don't want any of this (hyperventilating) hi i'm keyleth do you want to step outside okay no not enough (groan) does the nausea always happen is that always a thing maybe it's the fact that i feel like i've been lied to my entire god damn life and it's all crashing down upon me right now so druish so yeah you could say-- how about a little bit of column a and a little bit of column b yeah yeah how did you deal with it really like what oh i don't know exactly what you said sure right yeah got you i don't know at all what you just told me i'm not going to lie but i think i get the message yes jeez you're like the first person-- no one else gets it no they don't is that it that's it we will destroy everything we touch we will cause more harm than good we will carve a path of destruction and make it seem like we're doing good and then people will worship us because they think we're heroes when in the back of my head i'm thinking about all the death that has come by our hands yeah you know kerr you're not really helping make me feel better about this i'm not going to lie so much thought i swear i've gotten nosebleeds keep going that's beside the point grog yeah i so badly wish i could have what he has so you're saying this is my curse this is my duty and what if the ultimate problem is that i feel like i've had zero control from the start since birth i didn't want any of this i didn't want my abilities i didn't know i was special until now and i so desperately just want to be normal i want to go back to being ignorance and bliss shoot okay thank you yeah yeah i give in yeah yeah you know kerr even surrounded-- so game of thrones yeah and my headdress is a little wonky i was pretty much going to say that in character but yeah that's pretty much what i feel no no that's-- i wasn't-- yeah yeah i tell kern-- car kerr care bear i tell kerr even surrounded by friends i often feel so alone thank you for being a friend even though we just met it's crowded inside did you think we were going to-- never mind we had a bender yeah say water to the endless jug i dip my finger in and take a taste i cast a create water spell so we can all have some water yeah we should have a big meeting let them decide what they want to do with the rest of their fucking lives i make a tonic out of the glissfoil that i had in my pouch from the garden back in emon pass it out a little hangover tonic yeah just a little crushed herbs and water like a tea it's fucking squatters we only got a c on our general inspection rating (laughter) i guess i could talk to them percy a city is nothing without living people in it a city is made up of the people that live inside of it we have to protect them first which we can facilitate can we even say that these people are in-- and kymal hasn't been hit yet i'm afraid with each refugee we add to another city we're only making it a larger target and there's no point in rebuilding-- why there's no point in rebuilding right now when there's still three other dragons who will only come and go 'stomp stomp stomp dead' they will yes but you're also not a vain dragon who just had one of its allies taken out in this very city these dragons are going to have a huge vendetta against westruun now i stand up on the podium um sorry while the terrible man and the terrible woman both absolutely have a point-- i look at the man who's off to side i agree with you that finding your loved ones is most important i believe we can actually maybe do a little bit of both here and solve both problems me alongside with the help of other magic users can help quickly build an underground bunker and i would be willing to help escort any party to kymal in order to help find your people whereas i do agree to an extent with percy that we should not let westruun fall to this this city is only as great as its people uh to westrunn huzzah we don't want to rebuild a city that's going to be stomped by dragons in another three months honestly if we take a couple days i can make a pretty extensive-- those we've lost that's not what you were going to say i don't really agree with immortalizing ourselves in stone-- --way before we're even dead-- if i complete my journey it could be upward of a thousand years or more less than a hundred if you're lucky how long no kidding not all of us are lucky enough to have a lineage in a name not many of us are lucky enough to have a lineage at all i guess that is one thing we can both agree on yeah no you're probably right look at him i guess this little guy is like the moment encapsulated hey bud are these two things happening simultaneously so we're all going to go i guess so you guys are going to need me to get back unless i can get you there and then you can walk back fly there walk back or you can-- i can mist form us and then we can get there in how many hours teleporting is more fun all right have fun you gnomes (magic crackle) high five high five asshole yeah scanlan you suck (laughter) well kerr i'm certainly glad that you showed up in my life in this time when i am building this-- whatever the hell this is thank you i put some ashari decorative stuff around it totally what's the flower of westruun beautiful it's covered in white irises his name's fassbender and he's got an awesome mustache and the bracelet's kind of just a bracelet but i made it it might be a friendship bracelet it might say friendship in ashari if you go up by the funeral pyres where we set the trap you'll find him percy will tell you where he is just read the directions i give kerr a big hug i'm going to miss you kerr no it's okay you don't have to say it back i'm sure i will see you at some point later i hate you no i have to go to the water tribe of the ashari why do you need to go back to vasselheim right now no it's in the opposite direction it's south of here i pull vax aside do you want to go alone do you want to go by yourself because if you want to go by yourself say something and we'll let you go if you think this is something you need to do by yourself then say something no you didn't to vasselheim to a far wooded area where magic is permissible outside of vasselheim patrick my new best friend kerr bear share it makes us feel like we're a grown up show now we're a real twitch stream with sponsors
