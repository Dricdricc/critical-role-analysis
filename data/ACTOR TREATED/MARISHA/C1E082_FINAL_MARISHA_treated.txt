gimme those boots also these boots may be good for our wonderful cleric these are boots of elvenkind while you wear these boots your steps make no sound regardless of the surface you are moving across you also have advantage on dexterity stealth checks that rely on moving silently sprinter's boots are pretty clutch for pike well then how's your stealth percy oh you have spider-boots what about you grog yeah my stealth is pretty all right i'm gonna do my circlet my antlers as always ring of protection spire of conflux is it an attunement thing do you have an extra spot kerr to attune grog grog how many fingers am i holding up this is the deck of many things so -2 to all of his saving throws permanently pike is just universally cute she's like a kigurumi if you wear it you're just automatically cute grog if you want also you can have my ring of protection which is a ring of protection +2 and it gives you +2 to ac and to all your saving throws i was gonna wear it but i could wear the cloak of displacement instead yeah okay you're welcome it's a little bit of a girly ring so i understand well you're full on attunements right you're full up yeah would the cloak work with armor right it wouldn't replace his armor a cloak are you okay with that vax kerr we have this cloak of displacement that's pretty awesome if you want to wear it okay i take the cloak and i throw it over him you gonna tweet it to him or text it to him whatever do you have a picture of the ring do you have a thing no yes we should pike how are you looking on feasts can gilmore and i'm assuming trinket is eating and allura is eating should i do a scrying eye see if i can still find raishan can i we don't if i scry on her cave would that tip her off the cave of opash only one way to find out i mean i can always teleport us there and scry there that way at least-- minutes that's a massive thing to consider i think we should too i know we need to get him another salt lick grog that's caca putting rocks in the bag of holding just filling it with rocks ox oxen troll dicks pet rocks just a bunch of pet rocks does she look badass in her full sorceress armor paint a picture what's she look like (laughter) what power-- how much energy do you use when you teleport mm then let me go with our transport via plants which is more of a six you know level yeah it looks like a very pretty island

gonna let that go (laughter) i'm assuming i found a tree that was close to her cavern that's big enough okay i try to stealthily sniff scanlan does he smell like-- okay 14 (sniffs) ah so nervous does he smell like the incense that i smelled from him before you smell like a sad man all right let's go i say to the sun tree i say i like your new haircut i have a new one too okay let's go does it look like the blight of the trees is getting more concentrated the closer to the top of the mountain grog is this what happens when you pee on trees we should talk with pike when we get home make sure you're okay no his bladder infection's fine did he find anything out did you find anything out can i do a nature check fancy that that's good 21 we have pass without a trace natural 20 marisha and if only it mattered right now pew-pew-pew 37 thanks for that microsoft outlook that was gonna be my question so like the petrified forest in arizona so these trees have been dead for hundreds of years all right and there's no new scarring that's very good did you read if the island was trapped or any type of arcane presence on it thordak made this his abode like the kind that gives you a really bad headache can i from a distance maybe do a nature check are these almost like siphons like wells where he was sucking the life force oh my gosh always quicksand why did i never find quicksand 22 so it's like a magical quasar that blasts out you figured it out grog good job i got a rock i can stone shape it a little bit thinner does it look like there's-- am i there i'm not there yet all right i'll go up is there a crack that looks like it can kind of just whittle it away that's kind of already started with the boulder i only have a limited amount of space that i can carve out so the boulder might be too thick but if i do it at the seam line i should be able to do it i want to do it at the seam does someone want to check for traps do i want to scry on the inside or are we just going in do i want to scry and see if she's there are we just going in well if she's not there yeah that's better oh they're still alive god damn it god okay all right that's big all right does anyone need to do anything else before we go in i have to pee too i have to pee so bad (laughter) it's both little bit of both does anyone need to do a thing okay okay okay i know we have him you've got a little bead of sweat on your forehead vex it's such a humid jungle i'm waiting to sculpt a hole in the door son of a bitch all right in spelunker-keyleth mode i'm looking through the hole with my darkvision what do i see oh son of a bitch that's a one it's so fucking dark you guys i shimmy out and say vex go in the hole i could try like what you said i can always worst-case scenario burn another 4th-level to finish this off yes we have do you have a relationship with all of your inanimate objects sure why would you say that percy man i feel like there's a lot of secrets well let me see i crawl back in the hole all right you know how like a blade of grass can break a block of concrete i'm doing some monk shit all right (laughter) no creeper no creeper okay i shimmy back out and i say no apparently that takes like 1000 years (laughter) the what of whatness it's a giant rock it's a boulder bigby would be an upper-level spell grog do you want to try and use some of your basic mechanics of physics of leveraging don't assault it don't insul-- don't insult or assault it if you could just-- i know i know this one isn't for you if you could take kima's sword pry open a crack let us slip in-- well don't you have the dragon sword definitely pike pike and grog pike and grog oh that's such a good idea we can just wedge it in there yeah that's a good call you guys wait we're all doing a strength check just straight strength 13 because it's wedged she could turn into a person she can also teleport let's not forget that okay let's keep going what is it these are dead things this is bone yeah yeah in terms of my vision it kind of rushes past you really fast it's a little disorienting can i do a-- this is some csi shit 30 total can i do-- i wanna do a quick check this is some bones-type shit can i see if these bones were charred recently or once again if these bones have been there for a long time i know this is some weird carbon-dating shit ooh that's good 28 years old if not longer okay but wait was thordak here over a year ago that's when allura and her team encountered him it's kind of like buying starbucks with the company amex so easy when you have the pin code (laughter) you freaked everyone out matt no don't worry about it mind you she's still closer to death yeah i go and find percy and i link arms okay i kinda guide percy as we go through being stealthy as fuck oh like some weird pompeii shit like he died that way oh jeez she didn't bring thordak back did she we're gonna have to fight an undead dragon what if we turn and just face the skull so it's looking into the corner so it's not looking at us oh man we should totally invest in those little pantyhose eggs no one else is in this room yeah can the half-elves with darkvision do a little-- don't fuck me gil oh thanks gil that's not bad perception right 26 keyleth is gonna go ahead and light up her fire hands go percy go percy go it's all a cosplay prop that's all it is oh it's so blood oh you're so right i think that's the word yeah and then i come up and i say can i pet your wings i've never pet them before this is our method we are spinal tap i have this ringing in my ear don't ve-- vax (laughter) oh that's cool it smells like strawberries perfect nightvision nothing for you still blurry i look over vex's shoulder maybe i don't know anything i know primordial scanlan goes up and looks at it i thought we figured something out oh i don't know i was lighting my hand i can do it are we gonna light this brazier keyleth goes up and just sticks her flaming hand right down into the middle of the brazier do i make a dexterity save as well yeah that's fair grog did you see that that was awesome (shouting) is the door open i'm sorry if i'm speaking loudly (laughter) (shouting) the door is not open what i go with percy i do that inspecting the shelves completely it's open flame-wreathed skulls (laughing) it's the kiss army i think you have zebrawood oh wait we're rolling initiative fuck me that's cocked natural 20 why can't i have these when it really makes sense 22 total me and scanlan nat-20 brothers for scanlan who's not here pike who rolled one it's a 2nd-level spell oh dear god i knew you were gonna say that hang on hang on i'm looking up the parameters of the spell let me see l-m-n-o-- (sings) for a revolution huh i got inspired sorry i got distracted okay which direction were we heading there's only two right now okay i'm going to cast moonbeam on hm let me do this one that guy that make sense so it's 120 foot it's a concentration spell up to a minute and it's a five-foot radius 40-foot-high cylinder it causes searing pain and takes 2d10 radiant damage after a constitution saving throw it's a five-foot radius can i then i do that fail oh that's good above average six plus seven is 13 points of damage you know just a little bit of radiant damage i'm on the-- are we all on the carpet we never did that then i will back away towards me and towards the southeast corner yeah southeast to you no no that's right that's right that's good this is the room it's also still the room everyone except scanlan or still scanlan wait dex throws how many do we-- oh we have to roll it each time natural 20 on my second we're trying to beat a 13 i cleared all of them no rolls for scanlan okay you saved from all of 'em same 17 natural 20 14 18 made of polyester if you saved against all of them 56 that's with a nat 20 with a nat 20 you still take half damage i saved all of them so i'm at 50 hit points there's one that's almost dead what's the one that's almost dead fucking dick do you get a grit point you get a grit point back kill it kill it grit point back did you know yeah i saved all mine you saved all yours with a little singed hair what the fuck is that it's a number it's still alive kill it why are you running backwards pike do we have maybe like a group heal 'cause i'm half hit points after flaming night riders i passed all of them one with a nat 20 look man we can't all be grog the barbarian that gives us advantage on all saving throws how long short rest i mean i could burn a mass cure wounds and heal us i don't know i feel like that was gonna happen she's a smart woman the least that we can assume is that she knows that's something song of rest is 1d12 healing points plus 12 plus 1d8 plus sorry plus 1d12 right he adds a 1d12 hit dice i'm not doing great i'm gonna burn my last few hit dice i'm at 95 would he do a bump right now he probably would wouldn't he probably is he-- wait hang on wait i feel like he texted no he didn't hang on how many bumps of suude does he have left would he do it for after raishan or before i think he would do it before too so he has one hit of suude left holy shit this feels so weird it feels so dirty he gave us instructions come on just straight constitution okay unextended spell metamagic so what does that buy us he has one sorcery point wait how do you spell sorcery how do you spell sorcery he can double-- so he could theoretically die by doing this so wait he can double the length of one spell the duration of one spell and it could be-- wait question what if it's one action could it be two actions he could do it back to back so only if it's below 24 hours one sorcery double okay all right all right holy shit keyleth is going to just before this short rest is going to give one cure wounds to herself just to top me off keyleth is at 116 hit points is this a spell attack bonus what what ability check his charisma plus his proficiency bonus big money no whammies that was good get some police up in here who hasn't made it down have i made it down what's going on with the blue light that's what we pay you in i'll be behind grog kerr with grog that looks safe guys in latin jehovah starts with an 'i' i go up to the edge of the rope bridge that percy's now standing on i lean down and on the dirt i cast druidcraft can i craft some vines to help reinforce the bridge as this happens scanlan sings hey percy you're so fine you're so fine you blow my mind hey percy hey percy hey percy you're so fine you're so fine you blow my mind with your gun with your gun and then he gets a point of inspiration thank you i feel like i had the same witty repartee as sam riegel that's cool 14 can i as a quick reaction grab the rope bridge an infinite loop of falling six seconds oh come on no come on what about from keyleth are they both attached to the broom does keyleth have an action you still have the inspiration right 'cause he's on the other side correct all righty keyleth's gonna go seeing percy misfire keyleth is going to grab a grasping vine on the side of the wall and she's going to go for that broom 'cause both pike and her are still grabbing onto that broom yeah you said she was 30 feet away can she not hit the wall get a vine off the side of the wall and bring her down i've got a 60-foot range to this spell plus 30 feet from the grasping vine right or is it 30 and 30 i thought you were still grabbing onto the-- to the broom and pike's still grabbing onto the broom yeah i'm going for the broom come on man (laughter) grasping vine what what just general dex what i love you that was a natural 19 so that is plus my dex which is plus two so 21 hah i mean (yells grunts) everything's okay sorry i'm holding on man also as a bonus action i can switch the direction of the vine to lash out at the same creature as a bonus action so can i grasp a vine and hand them off and stair-step them down right it just says until the spell ends you can direct the vine to lash out at the same creature on my bonus action so well i don't wanna do that but i can't change the origin of the vine i'm not on the rug can i get on it as well and still maintain the concentration on my grasping vine what i'm trying to hold the concentration on their grasping vine so they don't get fucked so i'm going to get on the carpet that's true but i have advantage on concentration checks these days also grasping vine's not a concentration spell it's a bonus action and-- no no it's a concentration spell scanlan does have dimension door i'm maintaining concentration while floating next to kerr on the carpet how close are we to-- so we're not close to pike and vex if kerr's kicking me off i'm reaching for pike and the broom and still trying to maintain concentration while trying to reach for those guys i do 14 i have my advantage 'cause of warcaster yeah that one's cocked okay yeah i beat that ten with a 26 what are you grabbing onto the carpet i let go and can i switch to a gust cantrip to try and push us down it's a pain in our ass but it's really awesome dead bodies falling to the ceiling reaching up yeah no it's cool this is definitely a brendan frasier movie and i go over to percy and i say smitten smitten i thought everyone was over son of a bitch grog can you backpack scanlan and jump really hard can you attach the chain of returning to the hammer how much time has it been what's up top gun high-five and i give her a big high-five what high-five woo it's her and pike now i give her a high-five don't put these ideas in his head we're just not light enough i reach down and i grab a little pebble and toss it towards the fountain pebble how high roughly is the ceiling only 15 can i do an investigation can i do a closer look at the fountain man i hate investigating 20 total on the fountain 20 no gems i don't see any gems something magical about the fountain i mean we could have scanlan do a dispel magic on it dispel the fountain or the gem or i could carve the gem out of the ceiling but that means you have to touch it i can teach you later grog hey grog if it comes to that don't worry about it i stay with grog and percy nothing no sway both have light do we wanna split the party half one way half the other we can dispel magic the fountain i could also get rid of that gem we have options for dealing with that fountain i mean if it's just a trap then it's just a trap and we avoided it and we moved on i hang back with grog grog what do you think man what do you want to do you want to fill it with water do you think a full fountain would help our case in this instance we can try it do you want to fill it with water all right i support this endeavor if you want to do it grog she rolled good and then what what hang on what was your theory maybe we can do process of elimination hey allura good theory let's run let's run i knew it or in la and as always don't forget to tune in for talks machina on tuesday night with brian foster i'm sure he's going to have at least two of us throughout the week i'm sure he will announce two of us i hope they got those tetris stickers again that they had a year ago those tetris stickers were dope
