holy shit you've said too much about it now he has 40 floors how we're a happy family you know i do feel like our teamwork has been getting better though we've been doing so good synergizing oh a hundred percent he's inspiring you because he thinks you're going to fucking fail stop get off of me why your hands are a little clammy oh god why are you sweating why are you nervous you're nervous no that's his silence spell that he got recently scanlan are you experiencing a bit of cotton mouth maybe are your pupils a little dilated i turn to vax what did you do towards vasselheim tary the ashari we activated the chaos orbs crisis orbs i always mess them up we're not worried about you what distributor do you get your wine from just curious okay do we have a plan before we get there before i teleport us into the middle of a city that might possibly be in the middle of a war zone also i'm assuming he's traveling with an army how long would it take us to get out oh wait we chartered that boat do we care about those people or are we just going to leave them in the middle of the ocean okay fair argument we did put a 500 gold holding deposit on an incidental that we will not get back it would probably take us a while to get up and out to a tree right i'm being a little selfish with my upper-level spells okay you know what don't worry about it let's go let's just plane shift yeah i plane shift us to vasselheim where will you not get arrested trial forge oh hell no pass over maybe one of us maybe not all of us is the crazy zealot still running around i walk up to him yeah i believe you i've seen it too wait how did he talk to you okay yeah no accurate man i don't know how to deal with that type of abrasive personality but that guy resisted he knew when others didn't and he was crazy i don't know can i do a nature check to see if this is above my capabilities a minor miracle this seems like a minor miracle i could maybe try to carve out a patch of sunlight above us but i don't think it would be anything more than a morale boost at this point we have to keep people from defecting to him the more people that he has the more of his symbols that get spread around out of fear the more he'll win i turn to one of the guards of vasselheim sir if there was a universal sign of vasselheim a symbol of vasselheim or a sign to fight what would it be (laughter) okay i didn't know if there was like a rally or cry or something that you all universally believed in there's got to be something a symbol of vasselheim all right you know what never mind jeez your politics thanks lieutenant for nothing okay maybe some sort of sign will help them all right we go to the temple of sarenrae right now okay go and we defeated it kind of yeah performs a miracle he needs followers (stammers) just look outside but i'm not sassing have you met them before are you friends are you on the same mailing list i wouldn't be surprised if there is a spy in this room you have citizens of your city that are starting to paint his symbol on their doors out of fear this is the last thing you want in the middle of this crisis all time spent with any volunteer hands need to be from any spare clerics who can help calm the minds of the afraid okay so the crypts of (stumbles over words) tholmeer crypts of tholmayer and the silted veil yeah which are the two places in the zenwick mountains yeah angry icy terrain or cannibal zombie dwarves what all did we say i'm rolling with someone's lucky die that i got delivered audience yeah who's getting proposed to all of us why would you take it off what wait did you make a decree and then turn to us and say what's your plan she wants that paper also the hotel printer was broken you know what we should go shopping no grog no and maybe we should convert i should just stab myself in the eye right now let's do that silted veil and the crypts of thromora fromora but has turned violent because nature is angry didn't he already hear our two options marisha and man how does it work does he have several lines open and he switches back and forth and how bored is this guy yeah he's just trolling us but if we know that's what he would do then wouldn't he know that we would go to find him at what he would do undead icy zombies you could always do like the astral projection thing right i don't know if it's for pike or for the dm she destroyed a whole undead army being a laser light beam remember we've talked about this there's also the thing that if she dies while ashley's not here we're fucking assholes travis and she won't die if she's a (bubbling) thing but we can always easily go get her and now we have two immovable rods (cheering) what yeah did you see that they think we're going to die (laughter) so what exactly is our plan is it to try and keep vecna from gaining more forces or are we trying to cut off vecna and his forces then why go through the crypt is that not what other people are doing but he mentioned vecna has to be severely damaged-- so we're talking about doing this hey dm logistical question how many days does it take me to make a 4th-level scroll spell spell scroll 4th-level how many days allura also said yo plan maybe plan a little i have freedom of movement but i have three 4th-level spells i can start burning into my 5th-level spells as well but it lasts for an hour so i was trying to figure out if there's a way-- oh yeah oh my god there is that's hilarious i like your technique fucking druids are badass four miles he's passed them if we get a little bit closer i can do a commune with nature spell and try and figure out some stuff it's all i've got i can scry the way they're heading i can scry on lady briarwood ooh all right scrying on briarwood oh she rolls 21 is he still with her though oh hi vex all right i'll scry on undead douchey it was shaking-- oh is it on the back of some giant turtle or something (laughter) it'd be so cute oh (giggles) yeah man inspiring speech so we're on a brass dragon wait what you know scanlan (cheering) what i'm saying is you should believe in yourselves the way that i believe in you scanlan and the way that you believe in everyone else scanlan because you're all strong and unique and we're probably going to die (laughter) ooh cedar can i do a nature check yeah (cheering) i am doing a nature check if it looks like a path has been bore through in a straight line like it looks like it's going through 24 (anguished sounds) it is a giant turtle it totally fucking is yeah yeah probably bigger can i do a nature check to find out how fucking big this guy is yeah let's do this lucky one that's not too bad 28 hang on though caverns undead caverns of dwarves inside the titan yeah maybe or fight it from the inside out i do a bit of a gust spell ahead of us to clear the path give him a little more visual line of sight yeah theory time maybe this primordial is marching with thar amphala on its back to vasselheim if i were a god wanting to prove that i'm awesome and do a big miracle thing i would drop a giant city on top of another city can i do it too i do well i grabbed some so i can cultivate more of it yeah let me see what i packed okay we could do wind walk it's going to take a minute to transform in and out i also have animal shapes i can throw out a fog cloud and try and fog us the rest of the way we're in clouds oh yeah that's a good point you make yourself more nauseous by closing your eyes 30 that's it he's leaking from the back of his calf from the back of his hip i don't think there's any landing i think there's going to be-- yeah but you know what let's see what happens this is a group success or failure thing right vax whisper wait what he hits our entire relationship has been psychic damage baby (sputtering) hold on and i go giant eagle form no keep going (cawing) tell them keep going i dodge it i try and dodge it it's just on me add a d4 yeah four yeah okay 24 total you
