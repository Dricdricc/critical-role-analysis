a first impression of keyleth would  leave you with little information on the half-elven druid  you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet  (chuckle) of course it would be unwise underestimate her  based on first impressions (thunder crack) under that unintimidating petite frame is a  vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of  champions pee their pants literally  (soft chuckle) born to the air tribe of the ashari people  keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics  it is her peopleâ€™s inherent duty to protect the  delicate areas in tal'dorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl she had quite a knack  for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and  flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do  (clears throat)  anyways it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe  her father kohren realized her true prodigious abilities and  she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and  replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions  and exceedingly high expectations  every druid leader to be must embark on journey  to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect  amongst the fellow headmasters  they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path  to truly discovering herself  not knowing when or if she will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben  she meditated on the task ahead  part of the aramente is proving yourself  a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader  with this knowledge one thought plays in repeat in her mind is she even worthy
