watching after we take a short rest maybe give it to scanlan scanlan do you have anything in your head slot (laughs) have we done some healing has healing been done is it what time is it i wanted to talk to my team can we talk now or talk after break it's up to you well we'll wait for vax to get back well i don't-- where's kima (whispering) i don't want to talk in front of kima (speaking) kima earmuffs kima scanlan do you have an earring okay so scanlan can hear i think we should get out of here well we've got grog we've got kima we came here to find kima that was our mission i don't trust her well look she's been she just gave me the wrong vibe up front she's been very rude-- right but look what happened she's brought countless people down here only to meet their end right look all i know is that only a fool believes that his path is the most virtuous see and he's got an intelligence of six why (crying) how do we know we are doing the right thing we've killed a lot of people you guys we've killed a lot of people how do we know we're not just interfering with issues that aren't our own we didn't know any of this until we came down here and look she wants to take the horn she wants the horn and she wants to take it back herself i understand you clarota and i'm on your side i swear but a lot of people-- there have been a lot of murderers who said they did the things that they did because their gods told them to do it right i just have a bad feeling this horn can't make it back up to the surface you guys have to promise me that she wants to take it back why if it's that bad why does she want it i just hope we're not the darkness oh god orion oh is that-- i'm sorry kima i just wanted to apologize i came across too harshly that night well i can grant you that only if you promise to grant us respect in return because i feel you were a little untrusting of what we were doing up front which i once again understand same here a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet (chuckle) of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions (thunder) under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally (soft chuckle) born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics it is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in tal'dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do (clears throat) anyways it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy wait also the paypal is working again for donations and indian food apparently did you mean clarota you said k'varn summon the staples yes what i'm doing okay yeah why i'm here for you too i know so glad we have him back i think it's a trap he wants us he wants us there did you say that there was mushrooms a mushroom forest a fungus but we haven't seen it yet but we're starting to go into the crystal caverns does it appear to be producing cold can i do a nature check to figure out what kind of crystal this may be 13 for my nature check not that great it's all right we also have a fancy bag of holding make biscuits trinket make biscuits on grog's back it just looks like a death trap how long-dead wait wait what (all laugh) half-orc okay hang on you listed all that off how do we get rid of this what did you touch what did you grab are you just having party arguments right now what i go over to one of the crystal walls and i put my hand on the crystal and i cast daylight trying to see if i can emanate it up through the dome i want it to light up the crystal trying to see how far i can get it to reach up to the top okay plants look living things 20 me i run over to the edge of the water and i do a swan dive and as i swan dive i turn into a shark in the water i do a lap go check it out so there's nothing in the boats at all weird make a perception check (mumbles) yep yep 12 as a shark right i go and i see that grog's underwater and i flipper him and go up under him and hold on here we go well you've heard of those-- never mind i'm just going to keep going i carry grog over to the island on the other side i go over and i swim grog over and can i as a shark give some shark push from the bottom sick potions i tried to look but i'm a shark so i don't know shit really it's a boat you want to jump on my back i can see him i try and push it and i try to swim underneath it (singing) the love boat i'm going to stay a shark and follow in the water can i tow them yeah yeah not as much rowing do you guys want to get out the rope and put it around me i swim through the loop do we want to check them all out clear out the fog of war i think if we can go here to this little island i might be able to do some think-y spy-y scrying stuff before we storm the city cave first i'm towing us i'll hug the far wall though i'll hug the wall i'll stay with the boat as a shark ooh pretty flashy grog's running in i'm a shark still can you yes and we broke paypal save grog it's like a walkthrough yeah actually if you want a good creative
