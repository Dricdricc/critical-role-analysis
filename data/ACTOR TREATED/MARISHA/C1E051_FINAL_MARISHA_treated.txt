wilson wilson standing there leaning forward at a large though you know i will say though initially what is your dc on this it's through the hand cone so it's 20 okay that's a lot we're birds on a wall we're standing together in like the tall grass that's right okay circle around 26 shit i think he's too far away you guys i don't know so is there anyone coming towards the-- at this point in time you guys on your side notice --and you as well--a cluster of about six individuals come rushing towards the gate and the two guards who were over to the side earlier join up with them they stop for a second and they discuss at a distance then they all turn and rush towards the gate as a group of nine (gasps) come on trap work trap work trap 180 feet all of it i know all the dice 21 34 34 turns to 68 plus the bonus is 70 74 okay bring it go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw to try and grab the ledge before you plummet that's not great uh 11 unfortunately you don't even know which way is up as the talons chuck you forth and you plummet from the top of the wall you fall down a total of 45 feet can i go like can i turn back into a raven as i fall my other bonus my other action yeah i'll say go ahead make a constitution saving throw as part of your concentration check just to see if you're able to focus your mind in that quick period of time uh 19 19 yeah (applause) as you're spiraling backwards seeing the eagle you look behind you to the ground close your eyes swoop upward into the form of a raven since i'm a raven now can i do a loop back to the center of town and see what's going on yep so you're heading back to the center of town it's gonna take you a little bit to get there yep they get back up to the top they spend most of their turn getting to that edge and taking a few steps away from it getting their weapons out and kind of glaring at each other and trying to figure out what the hell they can do right now as you start looming towards them i unarmed start walking towards them and i say where is kevdak pike is back with that the little bit of noise distraction outside turns his face his eyes peeking out the corner of the eye sockets and that's just the little moment of opportunity you need to go ahead and double up and slam upward with the butt of the hammer go ahead roll damage for that attack how does he get four attacks is he a fighter yes yes five feet oh my god yes oh my god let's count let's count fucking asshole yeah go go go am i back to town yet it takes a while 23 whee all right i'll say as you use your movement to push forward go ahead and make your athletics check 18 and with that he-- (mimics fight sounds) reaching out grasps catches the very edge of the ledge behind him and the rock just breaks (laughing) no he vanishes screaming into the pit below as you step forward and look over what little glint of daylight even makes the bottom area 'cause it's far out of your range for dark vision you just see enough of a movement on the bottom and then no movement whatsoever have a plan has been hit has not returned correct i'm looking for scanlan on my way back by the way yeah you are currently hunkered down with kaylee dr dranzel and this cluster of nine survivors you've managed to parry off one incursion of these herd members within the temple the barricaded door is still slightly ajar as closing it would make quite a bit of noise okay oh no can i hear him am i close enough by yet i'd say by now you've returned in raven form you can hear him over the earpiece they might have him held prisoner why didn't we give a gatestone we should always give-- are we trying to get this-- we're talking about 100 to 150 feet up comparatively are we trying to get this eagle is that what we're trying-- yeah it's trying to kill me yeah well i was headed that way hang on wait well oh i'm headed to the body still it's inside the gate yeah yeah it fell inside the gate of the city you approach and it's a rough scene fell on like the head and the shoulder the rest of the body's kind of-- gotcha but yeah there's no inclination this is a member of the ashari okay so is there anything good on her there is a a soaked set of leather armor (chuckles) non-magical non-magical from what you can gather what about parkouring but if i can parkour it i can find i wanna be able to parkour parkour i wanna try and be smart about it and find it any way i can make it right make an acrobatics check we have a plan i thought we were going in we're heading into the city-- i don't know did your plan work scanlan it appears they are doubling down in the center of the town do you have any idea on why they would be doing this well i don't know they're very perceptive i may have alerted all of them to our presence sure and in a sense that was my mission so-- a distraction from their terrible terrible lives yeah where are you okay grog right okay so we go to them and if we get too close they slit all their throats it's like basic goliath logic okay all right all right well are we nearby a sewer system scanlan do you know oh i happen to know exactly where a sewer system is we can try and sewer cross town or we can just walk right in how do we get out of this with the most - or sorry with the least civilian casualties grog sure we were supposed to also pick something up yes a two-story-- a half hour will they start killing people yeah 30 minutes is nothing in a hostage situation does anyone else need to heal up i wanna burn a hit dice well we should try and probably have a few people on civilian duty as well kind of like we did before okay if we know the city this well how far would you say is wilhand's place from where we are now i'd say it's about i'm gonna go-- i'm gonna stay with grog okay are you guys bee lining it like straight through-- no i was gonna say-- what were you gonna say yeah i was gonna see if i should switch out the gauntlets of ogre strength for these braces of defense that give me +2 to my ac but if i wear that then it takes out my natural armor what about-- no it's not considered armor not actually wearing armor it's designed for somebody who does not so well i could do it ahead of time-- just do it grog oh shit what is this just shut up and take it scanlan that was the cutest thing now i walk out oh god no are you guys following behind or just letting him do his thing we stealth like-- we watch him leave he's pretty stacked okay ooh 33 go go that's so bad ass all right onward with our murdering spree let's go wait wait are they going to know that their two people are gone oh then 24 hiding (laughter) they move past and all of you companions are currently gone you're by yourself hiding this big underneath a doorway in your elemental form what do you want to do they're gone though okay i follow them okay you guys make your way since i'm already elemental form i'm going to go ahead and start parting off from the rest of the crowd i'm going to flake around to the other side i'm going to start flanking okay so you've got to the other side now the bells have now fully subsided all the various warning bells that would go off every few minutes just kind of keeping the state of awareness going have begun to just dissipate and stop the elf behind you is kind of glancing back and forth over his shoulder but still keeps a blade forward you go past that t intersection continuing onward into the open central square on the north portion of the road there's the main central road that you guys have been walking and it opens up into brick and cobblestone upward with a slight square road interfacing the center a series of shops and tents and on the left side you recall is where noja's shop once was abjurist noja who had saved you at the first winter's veil not that you guys see this at the moment but you see this glancing off to the side the door's kind of half open it looks like a window's broken and the inside has probably been ransacked as well and as you step in you can see that there are a number of tents that are half fallen over carts that are tipped over with fruit and vegetables that have scattered across the floor and they've just been left there to rot there are barrels containing looks like rain water that has gathered over time and section after section of these wedged barricades of pieces of wood that have been jammed into piles with giant spikes and pole arms that have been jammed in there as a defensive place and just to be an ominous position for anyone who attempts to walk into this vicinity and you see about every five or six of these there is a head adorning it that has been just kind of wedge on pushed as a warning yeah you did i don't think you've told us yet seven yeah you glance around a little bit nothing catches your eye you're too focused on the goal at hand as you step through each barricade as you go through the first set already you can see the cluster of goliaths and as well as individuals that step forward and are like hey who are you bringing here and the elf behind you says apparently a blood relative of kevdak's is this true and a few of the goliaths step forward and say oh i doubt that and the one on the other side says blood relative the only one is up inside he steps forward and you see the next goliath that you recognize this is one of the older seers who has one eye that is completely clouded over white and is this kind of swollen puss filled socket that has been kind of perpetually infected over time thunder lord at which point all the goliaths step back and some of them turn their blades or weapons around and - start slamming them on the ground in a rhythmic tone (group groans) over and over again and some of them start going into slow chants (imitates chanting) and as this happens louder and louder the clattering echos through the center of this market place this now desolate space some of them that were clutching people just kind of throw them to the side and some of the peasants begin like scramble up against a wall not knowing where to go or seemingly knowing that if they were to try to flee it would be the very end of their existence and are just frozen in fear as this is happening you see at the margrave's home the multi-tiered homestead this beautiful mansion which is now smeared with gore this dried dark brown and brittle the flickering glow of interior candlelight catches your attention until across the top floor you see a balcony that looks over the entirety of this open area and there the dark form of kevdak steps out a towering goliath in his own right as he comes forward puts his hands on the railing the rhythmic slamming of the weapons growing loud like this cacophonous rhythm his fingers slowly tense and the wood splinters in his grasp as you can see before you indeed the titanstone gauntlets themselves almost cartoonish in size even against his large frame he looks down with his gleaming red eyes smooth bald head no tattoo adorning it but most of his entire body nearly black with scrawlings of ink for every single life he's taken as he's led this herd he looks down (laughter) into the center of this area down to you with a joyous smile almost and says grog strongjaw i would have never expected this not in a very very long time i've got to say i've got to give credit to my boy for not being quite the fable maker that i thought he was trying to appease me with the ideas of finishing a threat that was apparently left hanging so you come here cast away of the herd of storms you have my attention now what words do you bring my ears before i tear them from your skull boy hello uncle the piece of shit you wiped off your boot has come home when last we saw each other you saw it fitting to beat down a mere child i remember another child that got a beating seems like he came from your nut sack (laughter) and my what an easy task that was sometimes the easiest are the most enjoyable if you let them string out for a long long time well a regular chip off the old block if he's anything like his father that is so i'll tell you why i've come back please do see i've grown i've learned i've also watched as dragons took the mighty kevdak wielder of the titanstone knuckles and made him bend the knee i was wondering do you also squat when you piss now (laughter) there are a few chuckles they're immediately silenced at the realization kevdak seemingly un-flinched by this he puts one hand on the railing and leaps over it (imitates booming) landing on the stone platform that makes the roof of the initial walkway and foyer of this mansion he steps out to the edge of it and crosses his arms and goes see that's your folly grog as it was your father's you're shortsighted survival isn't just chewing meat you find and killing what gets in your way if you pick a fight that you can't win history won't remember a blood smear on anyone's boot the dragon was a stage i've not bent the knee like you think i have i've merely let it co-exist for the time being but let's just say that dragon's days are numbered but it's a shame that you won't be around to see oh fancy words for what i hear as surrender but that's all right i've always believed the world is what we make of it and you've shown me exactly who you are you've shown this herd exactly who you are and what they can expect to live a nice domesticated life where the booty runs dry where the women are scarce where i'm sure there are plans this very minute to unseat you from your high horse but i've come to do them a favor they're not going to get that chance you and me i challenge you to single combat for the pride of this herd (applause) at this moment there is a long silence as just a breeze kind of (imitates wind) finds it's way through the center of this town kevdak waits motionless at the top of the mansion precipice everyone else looks up to him from you their faces aghast at what just transpired and staring up to him atop the mansion he looks down one side of his mouth curls into a wicked smirk he puts his hand up like this and you see as the rows of archers that were along the roof tops of nearby buildings lessen their grip on the bow and put the arrows away he crosses his arms again we reserve the right of single combat to members of the herd of storms you haven't been a number within our midst for years since you decided to lie there and bleed like a goat but i can't say i'm not amused by your gall so for the purposes of this bout let it be known that grog strongjaw is a temporary member of the herd but the moment his lifeless corpse hits the stone he will be stripped of any honor and fed to the wolves (growls) and he leaps off and lands cracking the stone beneath his feet as he stands again assemble the ring and you watch as all of the goliaths start grabbing and moving the barricades scooting them into a circular pattern around the center of this area go ahead and fetch the town square if you could that's true i was like did you steal toothpicks he did yeah where are we we're flanking slowly but surely i'm a puff of clouds can i get on this balcony area in mist form right yeah all righty so at this time as everyone assembles all the spikes inward in a circle position and you stand in place kevdak walks into the center of the ring he takes the gauntlets puts a hand out and one of the goliaths comes up and takes a weapon that you haven't seen in a while this dark red rust-colored ax is placed into his one hand as the gauntlet grips around it taking the blood ax in his hand he closes his other fist and slams them together and as he slams them together with a sound of metal his form warps and grows and what was once already kevdak who held a good four to five inches on your height swells to about 12 feet tall holy shit oh my god do we do anything right now not until he says so oh oh he's consulting the book totally what's an adventurer's kit run for and we started late i know i know i don't think i can forget fuck shit up it's like the battle of blue balls he's so big just five more minutes five more minutes you're at 133 out of your total 201 (groaning) he's fine he's fine i'm doing nothing to him yeah we'll have a video card next week we may already have one thanks to frye's electronics the fickleness of technology and the wondrous hard work of our crew make this still happen guys once again as i don't know who it was that pointed it out but we went 50 episodes that was me 50 episodes without any real huge
