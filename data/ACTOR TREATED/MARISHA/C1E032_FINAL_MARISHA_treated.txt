only 12 okay i throw up a wall of stone am i near the sun tree again okay so what i'm going to do is i want to conjure it from underneath me so as i see them filtering up i want to pop it up right from underneath me to where i'm on top of it ten feet ten foot by ten foot panels ten feet so i'm going to take the fire sphere and just start funneling it right down and start cleaning house just yeah right into the thick mess of them oh my god keyleth thinks she died keyleth thinks she's dead pike did we die no he critted i cast it at 4th-level so it's doing 5d6 right now they have to make dexterity saving throws oh really cheerleader boost this is going to be so badass so badass she accidentally rolled a d10 so she was re-rolling for a d20 and she rolled a natural 20 yes oh yay come on pike there's like 80 skeletons he has to roll for yeah (laughs) i know (laughter) she rolled a natural 20 good craftsmanship tea time i dodge a femur have to have a conversation oh fuck one i don't

they'll understand me too i like your headphones too by the way she's gone she ran away she took her headphones off and did a lap vaguely west yeah let's run i'm just running keyleth's running damn it it's the second one i've rolled in a row yeah i'm distracted come on percy roll he's got shitty ac damn it (groans) fuck nice okay so you're on him but there's a ton of people surrounding him okay i'm going to kill everybody if i start bringing down bolts of lightning so i'm going to move up a little bit to where i'm within 30 feet of him over here or something can i see vax okay so looking at the giant and realizing that if i bring lightning down i'll just start electrocuting everybody around i meditate for a second and go super calm and start casting heat metal and i start meditating on vax's daggers so your daggers are going to do an extra 2d8 damage and he's up against a wall correct okay i'm going to use my bonus i'm running fucking low on spells fuck i don't want to do it i'm going to do my bonus action to cast grasping vine okay it's because it worked that way in pathfinder i used to do that with grog's axe all the time thanks sam my spell save dc 18 i'm like yeah we're going to hurt this motherfucker so bad bonus action i'm going to wrap him up with a grasping vine and try to restrain him i'm like man i'm such a fucking badass right now what am i doing yeah i think he has to save against it fucking fail yeah can i pull him towards the center of the earth thanks man man i'm so cool right now i'm concentrating so hard and she's like well deal with it it's going to be awesome kill something and he's grappled so does he right because that's kind of badass seven points of damage does he also get the fire damage i go up to start seeing if i can salvage anything from this giant do i see vax with his hands in the mud what did-- what oh did it work though i'm sorry okay i put my hands in his hands and cast cure wounds i'm going to use it from my ring my spell-slot ring i'll do level two 12 before he runs off i tell him tell everyone to look for the sign of pelor in the sky what time is it right now it could be cursed can i salvage anything from the stone giant just a wisdom check 12 total head west meet up pike we've missed you so much how did you get here pike how did you know yeah can you take a look at him pike i believe it's out of my realm of understanding there was a long pause this isn't going to last long yeah i have a feeling she's probably using a lot of energy to do this too pike do you know how much longer you can stay in this form that you can stay with us get inside he's had this weird cough for a couple of days now we'll have her look at you there i do a gust to do that air umbrella thing around all of us yeah the really terrible one i'm doing that to help keep us shielded from the rain 17 come on city boy (laughs) oh shit can i do a nature check to see if this is natural or man-done i think that's a 21 yeah 21 i think this was blasted down good work grog if they've blasted in the entrance i have a feeling-- they're not expecting people are we inside let's all crawl in i light up my hands yeah take a look at him pike okay (sighs) that's the question it depends on if we're going to decide to-- i'll think about it i did a check on him pike his cough doesn't seem to be anything natural or disease-related so it's nothing like a fever not a real one anyway (quietly) come on pike if you have a greater restoration pike-- i don't have it on me a corruption point so does that get rid of one of his weird ailments what did you just do to him pike where did you go just then this room won't fit my storm cloud why no it's not going to work who's still awake i look at vax before we go to sleep and i say not going to pull any more jenga moments are you you sure because you just did that secret walkaround there we notice when you sneak off you do know that right okay hey i was the only one who didn't give you shit for that just keep that in mind corruption man son of a fuck natural one my third of the evening i had bad dreams i keep my hands aflame and kind of rub myself glad i don't use a bow that sounds good yeah i will say if we choose to feast i will not be able to sunbeam i couldn't i burned my sunbeam we couldn't have done it i don't know if pike-- does she have access to sixth-level spells we haven't leveled pike up in a while so she would have a sixth-level spell it depends on if clerics have it but that would also mean pike burning her 6th-level spell slot i can skywrite again i just need to move the boulders a bit we're the most capable people in this town right now they've got yennan he's awesome he was a badass cleric we're going to eat up fuck yeah yes i believe we need to go shopping pike you wouldn't happen to have a thousand gold-worth chalice on you would you never mind don't worry about it 2d10 or 2d8 2d12 and we're immune to fear and poison i think immune to fear immune to poison and immune to what else i'm going to move out some rocks just enough where i can peek out are we ready to go i'm just going to start this we can talk as we go i'm going outside i'm going outside is it still rainy still cloudy okay so i take the clouds and i darken them and do a giant de rolo crest that expands over the whole city to the de rolos to whitestone to vox machina do that ben and jerry's pint (laughter) i light up my hands for light can i do an arcana check to see if it's magical magic trap natural 20 making up for those fucking ones is it carved out of the rock got you but it's not magically trapped and if we touch it we're not going to be possessed or something i don't think so i'm sorry fucking doors doors he's helping ooh i rolled a 19 wait is this
