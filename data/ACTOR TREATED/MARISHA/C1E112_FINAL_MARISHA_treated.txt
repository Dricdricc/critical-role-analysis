we miss you so much you in your little pink hat we just love you also all the updates are on geek and sundry right don't tweet the same question 30 times to every member of the cast don't do that just look it up on geek and sundry you're going to get a quicker answer though if you look it up on geek and sundry american office or british office so we were going up a tunnel isn't that most of your paladin power oh dear god we've got other people who can do healing spells is this a short rest that we're doing does it make that sound sounds a bit like bringing the city to us i'm afraid it might slow us down yeah that's fun destroying everything in its path for forever the figures in the distance can we tell by scale how big they are do they look humanoid or bigger don't fuck me gil 21 do they appear to be looking for something or are they wandering like a patrol is that the same guy (laughing) ashley's face oh no yeah i will use a 5th-level spell to scry as opposed to the scrying eye does my scrying eye use my spellcasting ability no it's 15 i'm going to scry on-- she'll alert people to our presence yeah that death knight that seems to be the right-hand man yeah let's do it i want to scry on that big guy that was with delilah when i saw them walking out taliesin and with mine they're all right i'm using my last 5th-level spell for this do i see delilah can i get any other details on where he is can i see any other identifying landmarks is he going upwards oh he's in a tower he's trying to do it again or where shit that's probably what it was i'm sure he knows we're around odell tell viscon we have visitors i wrote that in quotes do you remember what odell looked like odell seemed to be a more high-ranking member of vecna's forces how many robes do we have are we going to claim that we're there to relieve them of their shift is that what you're pitching but then you went back and she was like now you're hideous now i'm not taking you back at all and you were spiteful so you went back and turned to a life of crime and deceit yes because one of the other minion guys was like odell go tell viscon who's the green robe guy then are they written on the tags like a school play property of-- you know these people have anal-retentiveness issues because the red robe was odell viskorad and viscon are two different people so there is no viscon there's a viscorad your long-lost wedding ring from your past marriage we've got camo paint and camo clothes while carrying a bush keyleth finds some black dirt on the ground and gives a war paint wait before he goes i grab him and i cast freedom of movement on him you can't be grappled yes actually i can because freedom of movement is not a concentration spell so i'm going to burn my last 2nd-level spell and do enhance ability to give you-- peacock's charisma or whatever the fuck it's called let's do the druid dice oh yeah that's good skeletons we can handle pretty easily so wait it's 12 skeletons one rot behemoth and two-- one humanoid two crouched figures okay out of all of these the human with the two crouched things is what i'm most worried about well and humans have common sense that's true how wide are the tunnel entrances instead of collapsing three tunnels okay yeah i'm into this do people have abilities to make sure these people stay back and don't rush us while we get through but there's a person thing yeah because the skeletons are better to deal with this is all pretty much unworked stone for the most part since you said it was all self-carved it's pretty rough i could go earth elemental go into the walls collapse tunnel a you guys make a run from it i can earthglide through the walls get to the middle as soon as you guys get through and collapse second tunnel but it might take a little bit i don't know and i'll collapse tunnel one how far away is tunnel one right now no the one we came from i can throw up a wall of stone to block the tunnel we came from and then we go and we do the other stuff okay i'm burning the last of my shit 6th-level spell wall of stone laura and we block it up completely well my spell is going to make noise right should you guys stealth-kill first i stay with them as far as i can center tunnel go are we all in she's got this shit she's a cleric she's a monster let's go run it's daenerys' dragon yeah maybe it's in the dirt that we just came by i can i don't currently have locate object with me i can give my scrying eye to vex i don't know what it looks like unless we have seen it in which case i still don't know what it looks like i pull out the scrying eye toss it to vex you can have these rushes you know it can get a little intense you'll be great yeah try and focus real hard though yes and try and keep your mind clear and on the sword or else you'll get other weird interference it's very phallic but sword focus vex focus i told you it was where we just walked by i don't know if that's true can i have my scrying eye back i wanted to scry on scanlan but then grog wouldn't let me did you really paint mythcarver black why would you do that 3000 miles away your wife left you that lets me glide through earth it doesn't let me tunnel i can do a move earth spell you would die you would suffocate and be crushed from the pressure of the earth okay all right shit do you know how close it is all right here's the thing i have an 8th-level spell left and i have a 9th-level spell left i want to save one of those i can move earth and make 40-foot tunnels for up to two hours as i go would that work yeah but the voice from above said i can't glide the sword with me but i should be able to grab it and then concentrate-- well i'll already be an earth elemental and i'll have the gate stone all right this is a good plan what if we combine plans because etherealness can let you glide through your plane right it's a glidey thing but for all things right so can you take the potion piggy-back on me we glide together get the sword-- we've got our awesome telekinetic earrings and i can make tunnels though as long as i go with you i can't find it alone i can get close wait i thought we had to have more or less both though that's not how earth works though you can't wait down there and then switch back and then think you can grab this if it was sitting under a foot deep of muck someone would have found it by now but she knows what it looks like it's got to be a vex and kiki that's the thing it's got to be both of us you're stealthy as fuck we can get there get close enough get above it and then-- she's stealthy as fuck and i can glide under the dirt with you telling me where it is yeah can she guide me through-- all right i tunnel then fucking hell are we going to try and go above or are we tunnelling all the way there i'm going to burn my 8th-level spell on move earth i still have a 9th and then this is reaching the end of my shit every ten minutes if that's the case we have to move on foot above ground quickly and get close and then i can tunnel us down i think that's the only way other than that we're taking several hours to get there at a very slow pace wait scanlan you still have a mansion we could break this up scanlan casts the mansion we split the party and we have a stealth team go get the sword and come back-- if they're in the mansion though-- he can't sense anyone in the mansion so we cast the mansion while you're still here half the party goes in team stealth sword recovery plan goes out gets the sword while the rest of the team camps in the mansion unless we all want to decide right here and right now to try and get closer to the sword than the thousand feet we are potentially away from it right now together as a team and then cast the mansion or not at all it'd be us two and maybe vax as well does anyone have a better plan is this what we're going with ashley and does the sphere fuck up the mansion and whatever the closest building is closest to the sword who all of us and you still have pass without a trace that doesn't take up one of your locate object spells does it then let me cast it i'm casting pass without a trace not her 2nd no i'm talking about my big mack daddies in order to still cast other things for everyone paying attention i have three 1st-level spells left no 2nd-level spells two 3rd one 4th and then an 8th and a 9th and that's it 18 plus nine plus another ten 38 i thought the same thing does someone have to be holding it i have the other one yeah no if i'm an earth elemental i can earthglide i do still have that yeah hopefully we're together though but yeah i toss vex the gate stone team stealth is stealthing as far as we can yeah liam and oh my god team half-elf yeah this is me saying this not keyleth all right don't fuck me opal die that opal die fucked me wait do i have advantage no can i do anything else okay let's go and i run into a door they covered for me right (shrieking noise) earth elemental (laughter) goddamn it no i'm beast shaped i'm my earth elemental right now okay so i have tremorsense right i sense the twins no oh but i have pass without a trace which is still going so i pop my head out jaws-ing and i'm going to be like-- i'm going to follow their footsteps with my tremorsense she stress exhaled directly down doing this as i go yeah swimming down not my strongest suit no i'm awesome i'm an earth elemental do i count the ones out can i roll it again on the inside are we sure with disadvantage five yeah i'm wise i'm not smart there's a difference actually i can we recently ruled because it's mental yeah oh wait no no i can't find it but maybe that etherealness thing and now i can literally come up and drag you down but you still have locate object and then you rub some on you so you can still maybe sense it maybe what but it might not be 60 feet away do we still have another one of those potions you can come with us this is one of those stupid dnd now we have to interpret what they mean wait though come on it's me and you now we got this we're good go i'm getting the fucking sword i'm getting this sword i'm here now under the fucking ground i reach up can i grab your shin hang on wait can i hear you can i see you nothing with her travis liam and why did we do this then is that 12 okay all right that's actually not too bad 14 seven go you should go i come over the ear piece and i say vax you should really go because you could compromise all of us by staying here you should go it could still work we're cool investigation at disadvantage oh that's better 13 it's heading downwards all right i'll keep being like this seems like a path of least resistance i'll glide through that for a bit vex vex vex vex can you throw a rock or something it's been 15 minutes i found a cavern i'm going to try to investigate this cavern i guess as much as i can am i still at disadvantage now that i'm in a cavern that's cool that's better god fucking hell nine i come over and i say vax where is your sister what do you mean we didn't think it through so she's not with you what vex i'm not going to leave without your sister bye i really like dill i'm speaking as myself right now marisha really likes dill i'm in a cavern alone vex vex give me a sign vex throw a pebble if you can hear me throw a pebble okay i'm also working this out as me and keyleth vax told me stay underground made a bad call sister's underground near me i know where to go he thinks i know where to go i go over to the muck the greenish liquid and throw a rock in what happens does it look like acid does it look like what we're used to with acid i just dip in my toe in the cold water just dip my toe in it's acid it's acid no one can hear me but i'm confirming it's acid i feel so alone two points of acid damage i go deeper not into the liquid just through the stone going deeper i do another sword check am i at disadvantage again that's good don't fuck me gil 16 disposing people i keep looking i can't leave without a vex eight i'm desperate i keep going can i go around and deeper can i follow this path a little bit i'm going to try and go under it i'm going to think if there's a pit of bodies that have been thrown away that maybe a sword is somewhere buried under this pit of bodies fucking hell this is so nerve-wracking six yeah but keyleth every few minutes i go vex i'm constantly vex vex vax vex still looking under this pit of people 12 okay i try and earth clear earth clear clear eyes this is stressful seven i go up to the cavern i'm out i'm bailing with this okay yeah i'm beating as i go upwards okay 21 84 70 76 okay yeah still going vex does he become a constellation after that how much time has it been come on trinket come on keyleth sees trinket keyleth sees trinket come on damn it (bear noises) where's vex vex i saw him appear suddenly right okay vex okay i pet trinket for an indeterminate amount of time i wait half my level i want to drop my form is this it okay i give her the sword i have the sword is it the sword it is the sword i know where the mansion is right vaguely okay go okay i'll see you soon and before she leaves i say do a little tap dance so i know on the outside where the mansion is i know where the mansion is though okay that's fine okay i doggie-paddle back i go in the mansion as fast as i can i drop form he knows we're in this vicinity i think once we get into the mansion he doesn't know an exact place so as long as they don't figure out the mansion i can plane shift us if we rest if we leave from a mansion i can teleport us back to a mansion with some pretty accurate-- it'd be the difference between the spa or the kitchen but if it's gone then it's gone but then i could still bamf us back to thar amphala or whatever other city that we came out of plane shift no but i am doing it as an 8th-level because i'm out-- i'm doing it as an 8th-level feywild do we have a city in the feywild that we know of that's safe-ish the pond fuck you the pond why did we do this did we leave behind a gate stone did someone say we were leaving one oh no does it have to be though that is the biggest blackest sword (laughter) look it doesn't have any blood on it anymore it sucked it all in hi kas aw thanks kas does he ever get full this is grog this is grog on sword of kas just say no i've been thinking about this just a little the feywild as you know when we've left before and when we go back sometimes time gets a little wibbly-wobbly there were some things going on with you at the time no we can't but do you remember our friend garmelie-slash-artagan he was cool well he's an archfey he told us he was an archfey they more or less control this realm or at least have strong dominance over it he might be able to help us make sure that we're going back in minutes as opposed to years we have to talk to artagan i bet he can help us i don't know though if he can help us might still be able to take a rest (whimpering) i need to sleep so bad i'm so tired (whimpering) i felt so alone let's not split the party you guys can it actually kill vecna even though vecna said it won't do us any good because vecna was all like oh you can't beat me it looks like a condomed penis don't tell people that artagan we can show you a good time first in comparison to the world events-- i don't know if you'd like it can you give us a full day in order to make sure that he does come back you would come back in 24 hours right i can get us back to thar amphala on the material plane and specify that but it doesn't specify where we're going to land in thar amphala i got a question artagan do you know if-- what this is so weird okay wait keyleth pulls vax aside are you sure about this are you okay with this we can ask if he wants something else and you'll be back yeah in 24 hours or so wait no wait i try to give him a kiss before we leave before getting dragged out this is fucking weird i'm saying as myself this is fucking weird what oh my god this is so dark i'd be freaking out well last time he got disintegrated so we didn't really see him evaporate but that makes sense oh stop it i kick the rocks out of formation oh i thought he dragged it outside somewhere in that time how long did it take last time it wasn't a full 24 hours but it was the next day i don't want to leave can we save him leftovers maybe besides garmelie gave us his word so we might as well wait a few hours at least right give a little tour of our land that you so desperately want access to undead dwarves sounds like a time-consuming thing is that how he lives all the time remember what sylas yeah that was the bag of holy dicks moment bag of holy dicks yeah i shot the beam off of pike's shield it was actually pretty dope but you just said the other thing couldn't be destroyed whatever you do i can get me plus eight other people through with plane shift eight willing creatures can you do a one-day blessing on ten of us i have to go home with you yeah dungeons and dicks sext them yeah send them a bunch of porn links that was a joke (laughter)
