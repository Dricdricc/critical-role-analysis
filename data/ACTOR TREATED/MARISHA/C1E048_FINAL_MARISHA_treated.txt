and i went to college there so i'm going to be finding my old homies and getting drunk i went to the performing arts school and we did make football t-shirts because we thought it was funny as our performing arts shirts yeah cool story bro a great way to celebrate i'll be filing an extension like everybody else it's an off-the-menu item you're now on the homeland security list oh i thought this was scripted yeah so don't yell at them don't be like bullshit what do the tents look like do they look like military encampment tents or refugee tents i couldn't help with that today what time is it mist form got us here maybe they're friends i wonder why everything he says is creepy that's some cartel shit right there you mean you've never thrown a party well all right why don't we just walk around and talk to these people maybe they're not even interested in being transported let's just find some citizens around we should probably do that as well not like a band of thieves bandits oh my god (gasps) drez yeah he protected us he's a magic user wait was he the guy that we stole from kind of it's been like three years and that was where we fought the golem and he's with us so-- he's not with them laura he's different than the other guys see he's got a beard keyleth goes up to simon how old are you now you've grown up so well and i just give him a big hug keyleth does a little wind gust and goes (poof) what's your current destination and what made you camp out here percy actually has family who's in charge there can they account for 70 extra people in whitestone right it hasn't been touched by dragons yet yet and what is necessarily stopping you from at least sending a handful of women and children ahead families that don't need to be nomadic they'd be there in an instant no one's returned who's come back can we speak to them do you know your way around the frostweald at all no are we camping the rest of the night question question can i do my transport via plants as a ritual cast to not burn a slot level that's what i thought that's what i thought okay keyleth spends the rest of the evening burning up my remainder spell slots to do curing on those who need it we'll write a letter ooh that's a good idea yeah yeah could task someone to find her immediately and then as soon as she gets the message she'll beam to us well i start attending to the children first well remember we were able to get about 25 or so people through last time with the spell okay well you know you didn't have to tell them that now could've just let it be a surprise is it okay that's good to know what didn't you see tell me what you didn't see what what do you mean are there trees here i thought we were on the edge of a forest how fucking far are trees i just need a tree to fit people through i need a person-width tree that's a nice morning hike that's doable there we go we form the line the ranks go go go go i turn to him and i go high five okay so you're a necromancer like natural elements oh shut up drez wait he might look master quall finish what you were saying first well we were headed towards-- how is what we're seeking less important than where we're seeking it i'm really confused does he look like the man capable of going and finding things he's trying to send us back into his own god damn basement to get his own shit hi pike and you remember drez i'm curious if you could be more beneficial in paying us with information with knowledge are you familiar with a sphinx named osysa resides up-- no are you familiar with any other sphinxes that reside in this area do you know the address well you do seem to be a master of items we are looking for certain special vestiges we're not sure yet we thought maybe he could help us find them but maybe you could be of a similar service sure wait what what hey what might this item be called sir quall the hunk of quall did we have any other information of where he is in the frostweald or do we just know frostweald past the frostweald that's so cool you're a beast sorry i do oh my gosh are we walking we haven't walked anywhere in so long it's like we're level three again i paint pictures in the clouds as we go this never happens are there any trees nearby how much further do we have do you think oh you have to show her the marble floors keyleth pops her head out into the hallway did i hear something about working are you working oh that's fantastic i might join you i can't sleep so yes i join percy and help him hey percy what are you trying to make do i assist him at all i pick one up off the table and i say hey vex (whoosh) i like that game it's my new favorite game we have more chickens isn't it pike go go go guys this is the best brunch we've ever done that was great thank you for that scanlan yeah so question before we leave you guys-- do we want to travel via wind walk or are we okay because i can save my strength okay all right thank you that's true keyleth takes a second to meditate on the previous time that we were here in the frostweald and i cast find the path 6th-level spell which gives me the most direct shortest route as long as i'm on the same plane existence of where i'm going if i have a vague idea of where i'm going we're trying to get to the stormcrest mountains through but we're also looking for the band of orcs travelling but we're in the frostweald right is the frostweald considered on a different plane well i can find us the shortest most direct route to the stormcrest mountains right stormcrest mountains but just because i can see them doesn't necessarily mean we're going to find the most direct path shortest direct path towards it right or is this a waste of a spell and i should just do something else i don't know it so it fails that's why i was trying to do stormcrest mountains but apparently that's not specific enough i'll do something else 18 it's a big obelisk are there any birds or anything like that around i'll come with you grog 11 religion nine what hell no i know that one but you should do it grog i can't do it just because of my elven abilities it's our saliva it doesn't work the same way but you should try it it's crazy upon him seeing that i pull out my hunk of quall and see if it lights up can i move a little bit closer to the obelisk i do control water can i do control water and clear away all the snow from around it son of a bitch i pull out the hunk of quall again anything hold it closer to the symbol can i do a nature check sorry elven sylvan druidic primordial oh okay a name is earned can i do a nature check to see if i can see any signs of basilisks 21 oh it was made by a creature it looks like fuck shit i'm standing right in the middle of them got the fucking shittiest initiative rolls pike damn yes yup uh-huh gamblers how many are left two i am remembering what the basilisks did last time and i've only done this once before and am going to go i'm looking down and transforming into a giant scorpion yeah they have blindsight it means they don't use their eyes to see things they have blindsight (clicking pincers) where are they the two are kind of in the middle there okay i'm going to move in between them and i'm going to do a multiattack on both of those i'll start on the one that grog's not focusing on so i have three attacks two with my claws and one with my stinger no why no i didn't i have blindsight as a scorpion no i turned into a scorpion i said i looked down but once i'm a scorpion i have blindsight well i said i looked down and turned into a scorpion to try and avoid it so i mean i did yeah that's the whole reason i did the scorpion miss six misses for the first one that's a three it misses again nope that's a two last one is an eight plus a four so that's 12 probably still nothing that legitimately made me spit my fucking coffee in my face all three okay i wish i remembered them do you want me to reroll all three jeez i'm going to tweet at you later about this these are just straight they don't have disadvantage first attack 14 second attack was a natural 18 so 22 for the tail 16 that's not very much four damage for the claw attack and then for the sting oh my god three damage and they have to take a constitution saving throw 12 fuck okay they take 4d10 poison and on a failed save they take half as much thanks guys wow these are fucking horrifying rolls six seven eight nine plus seven is 16 points of poison damage no that is halved sorry it was eight damage eight damage grog and i can take it anyway that hits so that was 21 i know and i keep looking at you katy perry style we are fucking eating it on rolls tonight subterranean tunnel can i use my blindsight tremorsense to see if i can feel how far away they are sounds like a lot of them i'm going to drop my scorpion form the things you say scanlan i'm just going to do a wall of stone flat over the area with the holes it'll last until they bust out of it so we either keep moving or figure out where we're going from here it has writing in elvish in it it says a name is earned in elvish i say ioun in elvish ioun knowledge i'm going in the triangle hole osysa sphinx what's in the hole i say earned did they give up a matching color 14 i hold up the hunk of quall i didn't bring it because everyone said not to learn that spell he said to learn something else because it wasn't going to be useful no you said to learn something it was at the beginning of the day okay i thought you were saying to pick something else because it wouldn't be handy but i take it back and i'll use it now if you want i'm so confused is it me tonight do i need sleep what am i missing i can keep it i never unlearned it it's been there the whole time i didn't use it it's not like i used a 6th-level spell look guys find the path that way that beam of light that she pointed out am i doing this wrong what that one i have it marked now i have a pin in it right that counts fucking handy that one is totally a great 6th-level spell i'm going to use all the time going forward what i've got it in my head now well you have a great story now i could i have conjure woodland beings in my back pocket today so i could conjure you a little posse to escort you have a little posse i don't know that's something else that i haven't done ever that always works so well we did say we were going to take care of the orcs we did promise that got to enjoy it now
