the distributor found them and now they're bringing some back to the distributor so they can be sent back to us and then we will be dropping those in the mail it feels like a time capsule but in a book it's so cute we love it yeah because you need a character sheet it's important when you've crawled into a mountain's butt right in that sciatic nerve can we do that can we find pressure points

maybe figure out the tunnel system or depending on where we are and if we think we're on that time crunch and we want to get going-- i didn't want to burn this yet i did bring find the path which is a one-day concentration spell which gets us to where we want to go as quick as possible but i don't know can i do that with thar amphala well if we're getting to thar amphala which is why i haven't wanted to do it yet until we felt like we needed to go i'm just saying we have that at our disposal when we feel do we want to do a quick commune with nature then to try and get paths it's going to take a few minutes though i could get an idea of the tunnel system for a three-mile radius okay 25 but you're not letting me cast it right if you see me topless please don't take a photo it was a joke it was a fucking joke that the internet will take too seriously i'm sure if you see liam topless take all the photos
