yay yeah which one did you get liam this is the rosewood purpleheart chicken heart yeah trade me seats for a second liam we're rat queens i'm violet you should and what does violet say we're going to put the kick-ass back in team something like that rat queens it's great yeah oh look who just showed up he made all of that by the way you wanna roleplay as the character you're dressed as yeah it's hard don't do that overnight rebellion four four there are six barrels one is empty are we back in our hole where we were yeah yeah i mean we can literally camp next to the roots of the tree if we want to i made it look nice in there i can clear out a bit more space speaking of nervous habits i was also thinking about the weird cough that you have i don't think you're getting sick what's going on oh and we've tunneled right we're below the ground let's go down into the cellar i'm going to go ahead and throw up some walls i can do the false terrain-- i'll do hallucinatory terrain and i will make it look like she said one story no cellar just wooden floor yeah no one's here looks like it hasn't been touched no in fact you pulled down your mask which you don't normally do in battles who could you feel it happening while it was were you conscious do you remember what you did and percy how long after the coup and after you lost your family was this dream you're speaking of these as if they're metaphysical beings you're serving revenge that sounds very literal and from what i've seen isn't inaccurate how would you disappoint us just because you started on this path for revenge doesn't mean you can't find other motivations along the way do you believe you're not doing this with your friends or for your friends not even a little bit it's only a hundred percent revenge i miss pike (laughs) suiting whenever he starts a description with i mean it's not good yes they've been oppressed but we've also seen there's plenty of cases of people being charmed by them we might have an army of people who will die for the briarwoods at any cost and not even realizing they're being charmed that way percy do you realize we tried to talk to you for a good 15 minutes after all that last night and you were unreachable do you remember that so us saying if you start getting out of control and you think that we're going to be able to be like yo percy calm it down a bit-- well maybe we should now that we have the knock-percy-out-in-case-of-emergency plan should we have a revolution plan because we seem to be divided on that i can actually yeah you want to get a beat on the vibe of what people are saying out there well there's a few people in our party who are good at that okay that's plan number one then i think it's not a bad idea that we spread this de rolo family crest around magic shop okay are we tunneling there it's nighttime no i think hallucinatory terrain lasts for-- okay which lasts for 24 hours i was going to say it would be probably a me and you thing in terms of making us not as noticeable seeming is probably going to be our closest thing i don't have anything-- i've got my antilife shell we can all get a good night's sleep i think if i tunnel us in and we've got hallucinatory terrain yeah of hallucinatory terrain it's 17 no 18 but i know they have to make an intelligence save to see through hallucinatory terrain exactly hypothetically yeah percy can't watch alone bagel it's getting colder it's another damn ghost wraith thing ghosting in that's kind of funny (laughter) you guys might be sporking can they do that yeah click click dagger dagger dagger i'm jimmy falloning so hard over here 12 it's only our first hour what like a level-4 magic missile (sing) rhinestone cowboy dual wielding are you proficient in that did i just get seriously boned in initiative am i still sleeping i'm still asleep guys well i'm real groggy how many's left three whoa okay i thought it was for a second okay what's the situation with the vampires that's all of them clustered there vax where is percy you're against the wall i get up can i reach around scanlan doing another reach around-- and i see as i reach around i'm like aw really and i'm blasting-- i'm blasting a sunbeam those two it's a line are they in a line can i shift to where i can that's what i want to do and i yell to the party shield your eyes awesome i roll a bunch of d6s how many d6s do i roll full damage okay so that is 15 19 not bad 21 plus 12 so that's 33 radiant damage and they are blinded where i can also not look at scanlan's penis that was cool so there is one alive and he's on vax okay i see that i turn and i see him and i'm gonna take a grasping vine and wrap around it and yank him trying to beat him up against the wall on the other side yep yes it is i conjure a vine-- i think it just happens nope 18 yeah i think so nice wood dagger they misted in i wrote all that stuff down what time is it midnight can i do some sort of check to see if the sun tree is their spawning ground just a straight intelligence check okay that's a natural one sure fuck it leave it up to chance all right i can't i blew all my natural energies doing that sunbeam wait are you talking about when vex and i came back with clarota and he helped us for quite a while is that what you're talking about yeah you're right vax vex let's stay are there two stories i technically used my hallucinatory terrain spell to make it look like a one-story tavern that i can do i'll do a wall of stone where i tunneled can we pop open a bottle of that wine i'll go with vax because i haven't been yet half-elves what what cue internet rage saving throw oh right because we've been in a cursed land for a while jack-of-all-trades 24 oh god look at that smirk on his face what does that mean now what can we do a check to see if there's any jerky or anything in the cellar did we already do that are we tunneling through this entire city i have one so are we breaking up are you two going to scout the town and the rest of us will-- the rest of us are finding a new hideout we've got the earrings okay i like that plan i was going to say i'd leave that up to you dorito i like that hot i might have to de-armor i've taken my scarf off because it's really hot it's really hot in here all right that was vox but they already know what we look like i thought we dropped seeming though true even newer people might be suspicious no we're walking around did he ever tell you about any details of this special assignment yeah can i do a perception check around the room and see if there's any indications that the briarwoods might have-- yeah a bug like some sort of something where they might be monitoring this place yes that kind of bug not bad 26 it's true (laughing) no you're stuck miss do you know the full name of percival de rolo percival von musel von lichtenstein de rolo iii de rolo iii that's it percival fredricks von stein-- oh my god it's another rod of holding immovable rod

the rod also we're going to have two more staying with us if that's okay let's not make ourselves known i want to see this i want to hear what's up yeah any familiar faces in the audience working

vampire wait you want to go bam-bam-bam that i'm cool with percy how much do you want people to see the de rolo family crest how much do you want people to know of your presence here do you want a big proclamation because i might have that yes because i learned a trick back in the day from my father and the air ashari people we used to do it as kids for fun but it might be perfect in this circumstance dual-wielding i can skywrite for you in the future they came up with these awesome things called-- sam matt and yeah skywriting with clouds yeah do we want the gray clouds to go away maybe temporarily temporarily yeah all right let's do it when do you want the symbol to go up lit the houses up yeah i think i could why is it raining again i'm going with scanlan i wasn't trying to help you i was trying to write the de rolo symbol in smoke i don't really care about you all right i'm going with them no that's what scanlan said what are we doing wait what what are we doing we're
