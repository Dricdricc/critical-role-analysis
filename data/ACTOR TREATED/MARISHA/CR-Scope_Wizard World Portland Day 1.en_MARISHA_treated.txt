the water bottle bow lean all the way up to the mic it has not come into play since he established that i imagine grog has an etsy store in his spare time making boots i didn't know that i had tried the druid in 4th edition and i hated it and i thought druids were useless and then we did this game and i was like all right yeah i guess i'll give druids a shot one more time this was pathfinder and you could pick a domain kind of like clerics could and i couldn't decide between any of the elements so i was like well i'll just start with air and i'll just make it my thing to go get all of them and that's how she was born not really out of character development mainly out of selfish min/maxer shit (laughter) i didn't mean to make her based off of the last airbender it subconsciously seeped in and happened that way yeah that's it really yes i don't even know where you pulled that from instead you pulled the amazing minor illusion move this is the first time i'm hearing any of this by the way (laughter) spoiler alert if you're not caught up go la la la la la yeah no i'm starting to get used to it yeah i mean we could talk about you and jarett (oohing) i actually did not expect that type of reaction it's a good question dude i love our system you have a good question let's give attention to someone else is that my-- too much that's a method yeah audience it sounds like your players have more issues of optimism audience you realize we get different numbers right we don't get the same i'm actually really excited because we have planned as soon as we all eventually die or if this campaign comes to an end we're going to have a party that's us at god's gate and it's just going to be us asking matt okay that one time that we did this-- and it's just going to be us asking matt all the questions that we've ever wanted to ask and that's true for storytelling in general (laughing) that was cool and there's always acquisitions inc acquisitions inc has been around forever they're great yeah next question audience hello audience to decipher the letter that i got from pike that was written in celestial audience you know it's still on my to-do list audience i'm sure it's a wonderful lovely message true was that you audience i'm going to cry if i read it okay keep going audience it's always a shame always shame yeah what was the con we were at this past weekend and the guy was telling a story about that and he rolled to just gently kick his friend awake just kind of nudging his friend awake and so the dm made him roll for it and he rolled a nat one oh it was a natural 20 he kicked his head off (laughter) you just got punished for a nat 20 i don't know if i've thought about it best con ever yeah i kind of agree with laura it's almost hard to say because the actors bring so much of the characters themselves that it just wouldn't be the same but i guess if i had to pick one thor i want thor tell that to marvel all right yeah oh shit i just realized it took me half a second dope audience she's even got the vex swagger going frederick von-- i love that if we wait for like ten minutes one will just appear they're spawning we are literally changing the world with d&d ultimately the whole reason we even did this show was to share it out with other people and to share the joy that is d&d and gaming it's just even more of a compliment and an honor to hear you guys paying it forward and to continue to spread the gospel that is the player's handbook (laughter) for portland audience all right all the way into the mic audience i know i think so i think he did like once hey hey he's gotten two how do you want to do this hopefully i've got it i can turn him into a red panda that's generally all i care about it's true it's true he always has it yeah every episode let's cut to the eight times between laura and i that we've been like we just (sobbing) oh god oh god this is crying i mean that counts oh i'd never heard that it's like a skin you can download in portal it's great i guess the best one that i have-- it's hard to top gavroche i was in a production of the nutcracker and i was a soldier we had to come through the flat on the stage and we had these hats that came down and we were soldiers and i missed the entrance and slammed into the flat anyone who does theater you know these flats are made out of cardboard so the whole thing went-- (shaking noise) and almost fell over it didn't fall over but-- it was very obvious that i smacked into a flat the entire section you're asking us as vox machina vax is probably the best person vax is probably most selfless yeah we don't really have these conversations we try and keep it for the game are we going to get shat on for metagaming it's interesting actually all the different ideals our characters have evolved everyone loves to comment on if keyleth did something right or wrong everyone seems to have an opinion and once again people need to understand where keyleth is coming from i'm the evil bastard honestly like legitimately keyleth has probably done some of the worst stuff that's also trying the hardest so it just really messes with her psyche it's true i'm the worst i try so hard we're extremely flawed everyone's broken we have no fucking clue what we're doing ever do you want my leftover one yeah and we're also a bunch of a personalities so sometimes you have to fight if you want to have a moment if you want to have something you have to not be afraid to jump in and you've probably seen a hundred times where some of us have started to do something and then it might have gotten cut off and then you have to let it go you move on just like in life sometimes it is not the right time or the right place i hope it's a good one so bad we've drank three beers in an hour thank you guys we have to pee because you've given us so many beers
