i love that you lost the printed-out e-mail letters in our move mm-hmm --you i can see the wrinkles from where it was packaged yeah we do need to decide something beau walks over to keg and grabs keg by the coif and tries to slam keg into the ground did you think that maybe telling us that lorenzo was a high fucking magic user would have been-- or are you still fucking working with them where is his fucking stupid tapestry where is it i go and i look is his tapestry still on her horse i storm over to it and i rip it off the horse and i say this is ours now he was our fucking friend he wasn't your fucking friend we're taking this back i go over to molly's body i think she's fucking right how long have you been separated from these fucking assholes it's not a lot of time to-- i search molly's body and look for the tarot cards first i take those and i keep those to myself take the amulet toss it to caleb i'm going to take what his dead body isn't using any more i'm going to leave him with everything else i don't think we should take his sword not without help anyway did you guys just suddenly fucking forget that they took yasha they took fjord they took jester fuck you both do y'all remember what molly said a few weeks ago when he told us that he left every town better than what he found it when he first told me that i remember that my first initial knee jerk reaction was you fucking arrogant narcissistic bastard no one can fucking know that he was an arrogant bastard but he was right and do you know how i know we had a conversation last night when we were up for watch and he asked me what my greatest lie was and we pulled fucking cards for it loser would go first he told me this story about tricking a town into thinking he was royalty being a king to pull off a scam i was almost going to tell him about my childhood and i didn't because he told that fucking story and i realized even in his scams when he was doing something shitty he was still making people feel good or feel special the town was being visited by-- graced by his presence by his royal highness and i told him this story of ruining a couple's lives by extorting them because i fucking could because i fucking felt like it i realized if i can deliberately leave a town shittier than what i found it of course he could fucking leave a town better than what he found it and i'm not going to do that again i'm not saying that i'm going to go off and be a fucking hero but maybe we can equal out and i can at least not fuck any more shit up take baby steps towards the leaving the town better thing that's the least i can do for him and i'm going to start with these fuckheads all right who the fuck is lucien i'm assuming shadycreek doesn't have high level priests and the empire and churches and stuff like that doesn't sound like the type of place that has-- yeah or cut and run like you said it's funny how the good people can make assholes like us feel so small i go back over to molly's body and start finding his coin purse he's going to sponsor his own campaign to resurrection nott want a trinket to remember molly by is that what you think i'm doing i take the money let's wrap him in his cloth it was impractical the moment he bought it it's a pretty awesome sword from what i remember that's a good idea (laughs) mollymauk's pretty unique and different it's a good name i take the swords or at least is there one fancy one and one basic one yeah we'll take that one summer's dance we'll give it back to him if he comes back to us well and also there might be grave robbers looters yeah i help him pour a drink long may he reign that's the best fucking shit i got maybe you should write another note and leave it on the coat that says don't fucking steal this you fucking looter assholes dead guy's buried here i feel like a note could be very convincing but that's fair all right let's go keg thank you i think we all would have been dead back there had you not made your offer which you didn't have to do it's noted what was your friend's name no more running for molly and yuto deal never a bad time it's a spy kill it that's so molly we're jumping in a bouncy funhouse over here we're having a grand old time just so great i thought you were talking to yourself again oh yeah you're not like a shared hallucination right we ran into a tribe on the way here you wouldn't happen to know an older woman named jumnda would you nott that's-- (laughing) you're terrible she said a strong woman on a mission to go find her son part of her clan was heading north would you happen to be nila or is it ny-la am i pronouncing that right it was nila nila nailed it it's nice to meet you on our good days that's pretty dangerous i like her i like her a lot she's kind of right show us that sounds great holy shit yeah good for me all right we should keep heading on to shadycreek then no yeah i'm going to go start mounting up the horses yeah it was you two doubled up and i had one oh fuck is it snowing-- is there snow on the ground does it look like they tried to escape the cage then they dumped the bodies i think he just cares that little for human life i'll help yeah i have my cool reversible cloak is it pass without a trace you're looking at yes so as long as we stay within 30 feet of you we get plus ten to our stealth bonus which would be very helpful correct that's badass i like that share body heat keeps us warmer beau tries to get a spot next to nila because she's large and fuzzy i'll take it six total i'm a little zoned out is this a saving throw or just a check 12 so cute yeah molly pays the toll two four six eight ten love you taliesin you know maybe people don't rely on you because you haven't been given the chance yet we're certainly going to rely on you it'll be a good test run at least for you then you can go back to your tribe and be like yo people relied on me it was great you should rely on me more i don't know they probably won't sound like that you guys are going to have three horses and then two riders okay we'll hide under the horse like indiana jones-style basically holding on underneath okay that's going to take some grip strength but i'm into it do they search you on the way in i'll hide as suitcase i'll be a bundle more stealthy you give us a bonus to our stealth is it makes us more hideable you know the blanket in lord of the rings the cloak-- it's like that rocky things sounds good or i could be a pack on one of your guys' horse almost like mm-hmm i'm wrapped in a bedroll plus ten right add ten to your roll your plus stealth it's not good for me either 21 with the buff yeah that's good what is the name of that place again ashly liam and amazing (muffled) i agree sam and i totally get the name of the place now it's very clever it seems that they don't have a strong housing code they can get away with these more unique builds it's very fascinating it's kind of cool yeah but i didn't talk as animals i wasn't talking as elementals i was like run jump oh shit i reverted that's all it's in the walls of the city or in city limits is it safe for me and keg to hop out without it looking shifty we do that i think horses have regular hearing we'll need all of that above and a little bit more i've had a hard week what were you saying champ his name's champ sybaritic nailed it maybe we'll get lucky and the problem she wants help with is the iron shepherds two birds with one stone we win still going along with that plan has not changed the molly problem was a hiccup seems kind of cold anyway that's pretty crazy she might be maybe we shouldn't stay here what time of day is it to be fair this isn't the iron shepherds' hideout we said right seems like they wouldn't come here rival family yeah let's formulate a plan in the morning i can't think right now i'm a little out of it i'll take a room for myself please i arrange for companionship and drinks it feels weird going and picking someone out that feels dirty yeah just make her hot please no just an hour and then i want to be alone please all right then i get really drunk and i go to my room for the night send up booze oh right i open the door uhh hi what's your name okay hot yeah exactly hotel prices what beau comes down the stairs hearing the end of it and just goes (applause) i could learn a few things from you that was a good apology damn good i have a feeling maybe her business has something to do with the iron shepherds as well do you know anything about any of the families here is it a female well i imagine we should also be listening carefully right now as well as then that's totally what he means badge of honor i mean you could say it was a nice little tussle it was a nice little square off i'd say we both won i definitely won i won a few times (laughter) ooh do they make my hickies go away holy shit this is miracle cream nila oh my god you could make a cosmetic line how does he do that is it like a militia that they're forming nila is there something wrong with the soil here or something do you know anything about this you could do a general nature check no no eight total all right what was the name of the forest you have to stop thinking that all people who look like each other know everybody no do they know how much further the marduns' keep is you got this wow i mean how long is long for a bird though dagon can live to be 30 she's going to outlive us all ooh spirits bone-spurred beasts okay ooh yeah mansion northwestish do they look like taskers do they have the same armor okay hired hands and an important message can i look around do i see anybody who's hidden watching from windows up above anything that looks like we're being watched not by guards necessarily 21 did i catch a glimpse of what the figure looks like okay yeah that's good can i do an insight check did it look like she cast a spell just then 25 shipments to zadash what all do you want us getting out of that house you think all of the iron shepherds will be there do you know-- sorry you can go i wonder if they're hiring how about something in trade just as a little added bonus as a favor kind of like her demeaning me with that little girl stuff i'm kind of into it anyway that priest you mentioned is he a pretty skilled priest would he happen to have any skills in reviving the dead sounds like he does specialize in those abilities when you put it like that if exceptions can be made for friends and family friends and family discount is a real thing what i was about to ask if i recognize any wine okay nine that's cool oh yes keep it down 'member berries 'member jester oh yeah i 'member you get all of your spells back after sleeping as well 17 we should plan that's true and something native just send the bird oh nobody move you want to send an owl towards that shadow see if frumpkin sees what that is those were the bone spikes (whispering) can you do that thing again (whispering) so we can all sneak by don't fuck me gil eh fuck you gil 21 three guards two hired hands and were there two more regular individuals could make a distraction in the woods get one of the guard's attention bring them in one at a time ambush them take their wardrobe between me and nila we could actually get in pretty quickly i could get in with the sword and she could be dropped in as a mouse well then we do one of two things we either send in nila as a mouse to scout to see if the iron shepherds are in there or we wait and we watch and we see who comes in and out watch the guard shifts see when the changeover is a guard shift would be the most opportune time to attack when they're changing shifts keg do you know if these people would have a secret entrance into the basement to the dungeon area tunnels do the guards sleep here on the estate or do they go home at night through a gate i thought you said there was a-- it's a solid gate to pick her up helivac her out owls eat mice i'm just saying it makes sense in nature we'll help you find your son keep it together in there all right now here's the thing goblin girl and hobo wizard have this spell where they can talk into your ear you probably won't be able to respond back as a mouse except for maybe squeaks squeaks that's good he's one of you that's so generalizing and demeaning no matt drowns the future comments question where this collection of barrels-- the collection of barrels are they on the inside in the courtyard how about we use that barrel pile as your meeting point we'll make sure that frumpkin's watching the barrel pile and you get back there when you're done scouting you got this and we're relying on you so you know don't fuck it up oh my god this is so exciting i'm so happy we sent in a laser pointer shit my terrible map of what i think based on what he drew were the porthole windows in the wall or in the actual building do the spiral stairs go up and down it's the game show host problem come on mouse come on mousey-poo oh that's good try and squeeze under this is when a natural 20 is-- aw there might be a hole in the floor or something else (clapping) awesome what did you learn that was awesome she didn't die as a mouse she turned into a mouse and then came back and was helped back out by your bird-cat that's awesome we know that there are members of the iron shepherds here and we know they have beds here wait until the fall of night take out the guards kill them in their sleep how long is it to travel to get back to town not as far as i thought if i know anything from my time in the criminal underworld it's these people always have secret passageways in and out we could do like a wide walk of the perimeter see if we find anything out-of-place in the forest see if there's a path and if we don't find anything make our way back into town look for a hired hand again with the burning thing so let's search around and see if we can search the woods perimeter check super stealth run yeah run we run back to town fuck the perimeter search away directly from the building great game how was it from the lobby yes nila
