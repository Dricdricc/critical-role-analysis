take it back is there a tree that looks climbable that i could get a vantage point oh sure anyone want to take a quick pee break all right let's go over to the bushes can we take it with us fairly easily just off the road but we don't have to go all the way to the tree i can-- i'm just going to go check out this tree over here see if i can get a little better vantage yeah kind of forgot about that both are very pleasant but i do not necessarily need that to feel fulfilled just people coming i wanted to wait for caleb it's a damn good tree i do miss climbing trees okay feels like childhood do you want up here all right i lift her up is there anything carved in the branches in the tree trunk 18 really what do you think lives in that hole have you ever seen an unicorn pocket unicorns

just don't get a lich phylactery installed in you again does it taste like stomach acid because that's gross man you taste like a seaman (laughter) you never told me where you got that sword i mean because i saw it get a little soggy a little drippy when we were fighting the frog thing so you know it's a pickled sword are there benefits to pickling your weapons oh right yeah it is very salty okay there are some pun competitions that get serious what happened on the trip rough waters i might be able help you with that i was obsessed with underwater life and mermaids so i've read a few books has that happened to you before by the way the whole waking up coughing salt water thing well excited to see what unfolds shall we i feel like the snooty town that i came from would have a winter's crest festival like how we have oktoberfests out here even though we have no real business having them yeah do some pull-ups on the tree branches just a little bit i don't mind do we have the highest perception fuck i almost got-- samesies 11 deal i'm going to scan still while i'm-- with my shitty vision i'm riding i'm just like what's wrong liam sam and think we just watched someone

attention to whistle not great not great at all three is that my action or a bonus action bonus action shit going in i jump through the window and before one of them leaves i'm going to crack them with the staff right over the head can i go in through the window i thought it was much closer than that oh they're going out the back door i thought they were going out that way okay that's bad disadvantage fog of war okay i'm going to double ba-- ah i can't move anymore can i i'm going to spend a ki point and do patient defense oh really ooh great i'll do that i'll just hold back and wait i thought i was going to still be a lot closer to nott and they all have disadvantage because i did patient defense miss i immediately go whoops 17 is my armor class okay i'm going to use deflect missiles for my reaction (grunting exertions) but it's not super-- i'm still level three so it's more like a cat swat that is seven on the dice plus seven 14 yeah let's do it just because i can i'm going to do it at the guy in front of me who's right behind me so i'm going to catch it and i'm going to spin around in a full flourish and i'm going to just throw it like a gambit card with the momentum that it's got what's the attack roll what is it i've never done this before it's brand new okay 16 four four damage total you make the attack with proficiency and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack so six total i go hah ooh miss and i go no seriously dude did you see that that's fair miss i just go excuse me for a second thank you we're all trying some shit it's okay he's the runt i do a little duck 17 hits i'm doing the animal control thing and be like no no bad my go okay let me put these hit points in apply changes okay i'm going to do something creative i'm going to take the arrow that nott just fired into the guy's chest i'm going to grab it can i rip it out with my off-hand spin around and stab him back in the blade god blessed fuck that's not good that's a ten okay i'm going to take my other off-hand attack on the one that just bit down on me i'm going to rip from it and elbow crack it right in the nose damn it that's 11 shit that was my bonus action wasn't it i can't use a ki point can i i was wanting to do a ki point to do patient defense again yeah can i back up into the house and close the door sure no i'll stay miss my stick mine drop it bad do you want to play or not you have so many fun gadgets bad dog how much that one hits three two you did a good thing here you did good today you just got the participation trophy take out a wheel i think that hits right oh poopers miss oh god okay i'm going to taste a little bit of blood that's now in my mouth get real fucking pissed off and i'm going to do a star wars-style flourish and go crack down to the new guy which one looks like he has less damage let's do the skeletal guy not good at all 14 okay eight points of damage i'm going to use my bonus action with that momentum i'm going to stick the staff in the ground and use that to lift myself up and do a two-footer kick into the other guy let's do flurry of blows nope this is my second i did but i did it as an action not on a bonus action and you said i didn't have to use a ki point i did patient defense i did one flurry of blows-- i spent one doing deflect and then one to do flurry of blows no this is the second one this is the first flurry of blows i'm doing shit i don't remember this was what i rolled right okay not good ten the other is okay 15 seven now i'm going to look around and i'm going to step back and into the house for just a minute this is fine just so i have cover right in the doorway quick timeout you hear a (faint scream) in the distance how do we feel about the cart do we chase after him you're welcome boo no bad halle berry lines marisha and okay i step out of the burning building sauntering like a badass john woo film yeah and looking at this one i go hey your friends have an inside joke without you pointing at the guy on the ground as soon as he turns i go whack like a baseball bat right across his head oh that's good 25 no sorry 24 i'm going to take that that's a 13 sorry ten nope 11 math i'm going to using that momentum do a helicopter flourish above and go crack down over top that's a natural 19 oh wait this is technically an off-handed ooh that's a four so eight points of damage fuck i'll hold no this here i have advantage on that fuck oh but that's still good 18 is that with my regular attack eight damage yeah who was allowed to run dope he's going to turn into powder hearing you say that i'm going to be like i guess we're-- race you i'm going to take off running after nott 40 feet speed i do that would just get me-- i'll save it for right now but i can see nott and i can see the guy and i can see the cart that was a double move all right ten are you down i grab fjord and i say just wait wait let them go i want to watch them as far as i can to try and pinpoint a direction that they're heading in not great 11 ah shit the town you guys and i'm going to go back and start trying to put out the fires we're like oh no put out this fire i totally remember kicking this guy's ass watchmaster has there been something else going on that you can think of that might have cut off their food supply bladegarden especially if they're as desperate as you say they are have you heard local farmers complaining about them stealing livestock missing livestock oh wc it's a good name dope i'm fine with that in the meantime you wouldn't have anything that might help
