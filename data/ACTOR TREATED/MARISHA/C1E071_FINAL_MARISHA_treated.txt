it is on your body go sit in the corner with it for 30 minutes taliesin you work in film and tv you know how this works get behind where we are yay must keep it going i know i think you've aged through the process so sweet that might be my favorite one that might be my favorite one you've done that was good boston you're not sure oh yes we're doing a halloween special edition two runs starting tuesday and we're bringing back all the hosts taliesin and i are the first episode and i know you guys love us so for everyone who's like i'm not watching anymore because taliesin's not the host anymore now you should watch again you're good at the spooky stuff you basically built our list it was amazing it's all good stuff we don't sleep percy how are you feeling you know he seems all right a little pale i feel like time is of the essence here probably not best to wait until morning look she already hates us are we (groans) we can maybe try and get pike gives us an extra day for pike i can go get her theoretically if we have an extra day she does have the stone right she does have the stone i think she has the stone okay well we don't want to necessarily have them jump in right away we want them to set vorugal on yenk correct glorified messengers at this point the goristro oh that's unfortunate two grogs is it like two grogs i can't he can so you're telling them are we going to go back and see them again okay we'll just say next morning then you go say hey we got an awesome thing for you okay well they gave us a location of the stones sure of course (giggles) you can trust me i do i was the last one you guys it feels-- doesn't really feel like anything sure i switch hands (laughter) i mean i could do what i did before and follow you as minxie worked last time i still have my one last shape as well it's a mountain-based tiger i'm a white snow tiger it's actually very cold in the mountains that's why they have thick coats who me he didn't see me before let me see something hang on because this'll tell me because polymorph-- you might go out of my range is the only problem range is 60 feet okay can i he can go do you want to go all right what do you want to be it's true sure i don't see why not i do that with one yellow eye and one black eye to match vex i give him one little blue feather just off the side little blue streak so tangled an hour i think it's an hour while they were gone i with fenthras and whisper was playing make-believe archer vex like a 12-year-old in the bedroom with a nerf bow it worked how did it go guys it might be like a cool combo move i can try and scry that i can do yeah we did but if i burn a higher-level spell then yeah what does it matter at this point all right i'll be right back see you guys in a minute a minute passes this is like when you walk the same direction you say bye and then you walk the same direction to the car i like your jacket it's really great were you sleeping this is so awkward oh my gosh you know i never thought about having poor timing with these gate stones i'm so sorry i thought you were on the toilet yeah me too i missed you yeah but it seems like i went around the world and back yeah we got all the way there and we were like oh we forgot pike do you want to go we can go now all right okay so we tree stride back right so yeah so the leader of ravenites her name is tooma and we went there and we were talking to her and i think we have a plan but not really a plan so we're going to figure it out as we go all right let's go that's the plan you're caught up (whispers) let's be quiet okay let's do this we stealth there oh that's a natural one no oh my god pike the plan hasn't even started pike i don't move either do we not move or do we run run (laughter) i cast grasping vine to grab onto her go go run dragon might know we're here well there might've been a rockslide and it might've been our fault i'm not sure i don't know grog they can see a shimmering door i'm assuming that was vorugal big white big dummy dragon at the pace in which that cliff fell apart last night i don't know about the structure of the topography here i can try and do a commune with nature and see i'll have to think on the caves honestly i'm not going to know a whole lot until we scout out the location i've got something i've never done before almost it's called animal shapes and it's basically polymorph but for all of us i can turn us all into whatever we want we are cows it's almost debatable because we look like an unnatural mist we can be misty animals that's dumb (laughter) we always keep our intellect animal shapes last for 24 hours i'm going to find that out right now because if we were a flock of birds vorugal's not going to give a shit about birds that is awesome so anyway back to the plan-- (laughter) i'm so excited all right thank you for your validation i imagine it depends on how scouting goes all right let's go scout i cast wind walk on everybody do you want to come scout we're going to scout or you can just stay it's mainly filled with chicken and there's the spa under that it's okay it's more for appearance i want to go to the summoning stone i'm going towards there sure i follow the crowd do we get some sort of bonus because we're mist jesus stealth and what 14 (laughs) i can save them i can save them all (giggles) my friends yeah i'll watch as they do that i'm going to mist down next to them hey guys what are we talking about (laughs) god so windy tonight all right well here's the problem i need to figure out what all of this is made out of i can't work with it if it's just ice it has to be natural stone so cover for me i'm going to drop down and start meditating i'm going to do a commune with nature spell do we have any other questions before i do this that we want to ask the land in general i guess do i need to figure out how far exactly vorugal is from us i have three good questions no it's not the weather forecast nature-y things i can ask it about-- yeah is there a starbucks nearby oh i was asking-- yeah i can ask it about topography i can ask about locations of people nearby things like that oh that's a good idea where the fuck is raishan okay she might be okay now i do this first and foremost what is the geological makeup of this land around me this ravine cliffside what is it made out of yeah and all of this stuff on the edges so it is fairly sturdy and not apparently going to collapse at any moment sure okay can i get a sense on what the weather is going to be like for the next 24 hours bummer okay good to know and do i sense raishan bummer she's within three miles well no he's said another aside from thordak okay that's it those are my three questions close to the ruins of draconia and not where the library and the ruins of draconia were and do we want them to connect so we can get through little half loops semi-circles i'm pushing out earth yeah vex and i mentioned that how loud will this be yeah but it's only a foot of ice we could do a test i could make walls of stone i can make little-- but also keep in mind anything that i do he'll notice and the whole point to this is to not make our presence known at all so we could pop in our tunnels and they could be like what's up on the other end of the ravine well you're still mist-form that lasts for eight hours you can mist back the mansion's considered a pocket plane oh away from us he's going west (gasps) does this mean we can dig what do you guys think should i do it over the earpiece i guess i'm making tunnels yeah i can melt ice i can make some more plant life no cool but how long does stone shape last i thought it was just for a little bit i know but how much it's only like a five foot cube right so i can't make a tunnel right so no i can make a little trench like a trench wall-line for you guys at the top of the ravine for the shooters yes exactly right along the ledge so yeah i'm going to do wall of stone fuck yeah i basically want a little almost half wall for cover here and here just extending the stonework upwards so that they can-- do the gears of war you know what let me flank it let me do one on that side and one over here yeah you think is this excessive i guess i could actually because i can do a flat one okay all right you know what i could make little pod bubbles for you guys on the half edge of the cliffs i'll do that yeah if we try and camouflage it spend the rest of the day camouflaging it the dm keeps looking at us like we're crazy all right here's what i'm going to do i'm going to make (stammers) little balconies (giggles) so smooth yeah little balcony ledges that they can go on yeah little ledge yeah a balcony i want to make a cliff balcony one there and one-- yeah and about what 40 feet up 50 feet up how about halfway up the mountain i want to make it look rough i want to try and camouflage it and then i'm also going to help percy and the rest of this excavation to use my gust and little create water spells over top of it to start covering them with ice yeah cover it with ice to make it look like the rest he normally only asks me that when we're making a terrible plan check out the big brains on brad 23 oh he let us do it he was heading west right raishan was south she was far south yes i kick scanlan a little bit larkin was it she's good i kick scanlan again for sheer joy this time larkin should we have someone near where the dragon is so we can get eyes watching yeah because the earrings don't work through the mansion right well the mansion could be good if things go terribly wrong she came in the mansion with us oh you haven't done it yet never mind can i get like a glimpse of it before i run in on what it is 27 damn it so it went hunting good idea who's going to keep an eye on larkin i knew the second she walked up hang on we weren't done we weren't done we have to do things we have to eat we have to do the heroes' feast for sure saves on wisdom throws also plus 2d10 and i think that's it that's right fuck you raishan an additional 11 to keyleth you got two tens and are we sure we don't want eyes on her i'm not concerned about her well-being clearly i'm concerned on whatever her name she's saying she is right now okay can i ask a logistical question how wide and alive are those trees so tree stride probably wouldn't work on these guys i'm wondering if i should waste my time all right snow camouflage i do yep i do i'm going to cast enhance ability on your charisma an hour so if we're ready to go yep do they appear to be ravenites vex you want to talk to them they might have told him might have been the ones that just told him we're ready whenever you are i can't do that you keep forgetting that's you who can do that no no it takes an action to cast i think i just peed a little i'm going to go ahead and wait until the 15-minute mark-- no i'm going to wait until the ten-minute mark and then enhance ability on scanlan i cast enhance ability on scanlan charisma and then i am going to move we don't have anyone over here yet really correct all right i'm going to-- fuck hide behind the tree and stealth as much as i can i can be an animal if you feel like you want eyes out here as well but i won't be able to go elemental until i rest all right i go in the mansion remember to be super direct with his name here let me give you the script you have advantage on charisma checks every little bit helps oh god that was the coolest thing you've ever done i've been waiting for this all week just dies instantly oh fuck apparently white dragons are its weakness yeah he's burned two of his legendary actions already yeah we're watching the dragon burn through his legendary actions so we know they're here i can ground him i'm just throwing it out there i can ground him it's time to go we're about to pop out yenk is on top isn't percy halfway down thanks pike should we pop out should we do this what's it looking like scanlan i can try and ground him it's a strength saving throw though it's going to be tough i say excuse me scanlan son of a fuck four did he lose his save against it we should still try to stay out of all this you're my favorite that's her turn what are you good for remember she learned from the druids a bunch of fucking nature shit man how awesome would this be (excited gasping) shut the fuck up she has to roll under her level which she did shut the fuck up ashley yes holy fuck pike that was amazing you've gotten close you've gotten really close okay oh god i'm going to pop out of the mansion i was expecting to do an earthbind spell but that's not necessary that's okay i'm going to fuck this guy up while he's down i'm going to peek around the corner going towards you a bit and seeing everyone there and all this go down i'm going to fire storm the fuck out of this i have ten of these i'm shaking yeah that's what i want i know i want it 7d10 i'll roll this one it's eight okay hang on (counting) 30 i picked it up 38 i'm going to use the last bit of my movement to pop back behind the stone can't say we're not honest the cloak doesn't have anything to do with this right with advantage natural 20 i thought you said advantage fucking fuck well then i guess i reroll i should have kept the first one that's an 18 which is good 23 that's 36 can you grapple him grapple a wing she crossed you he's a dick to her and now he's angry about it it's becoming a jenga mini-game okay i am going to cast earthbind on him 300 feet (frustrated noise) i am going to do a bonus action to cast healing word on myself heal myself real quick same thing i want to scoot back a little bit behind that tree a bit yeah because i got whacked with that ice breath and i don't want that to happen again all right you try to unjam it you're mad-dogging the dragon where is yenk is she going to go for him heroes' feast man don't eviscerate him it's fine it's not going anywhere it does look like he's copping a feel no this is our fantasy land man jesus he's back for my shit he's back for me and you pike okay 18 i'm at 36 luckily i also healed myself up this isn't good i'm up but pike isn't correct i'm not pike is there is an exit door we can literally toss pike's ass in the door how many are you down pike and those were all great weapon master that's fucking awesome don't forget you can go in the mansion pop in the mansion to heal if he takes you down and multi-attacks you he could kill you you healed her right she's conscious now i'm just watching everybody barrel to my feet holy shit that changes everything yeah wait is this melee does this come into play with the cloak so you're at disadvantage and that's it i'm still alive (roars) 22 okay i have 14 hit points now it's my turn i'm so torn you guys do i heal you guys or do i do damage and go earth elemental it's a big decision scanlan pike you're at one you're down what do i do guys do i try and kill him or do i heal it doesn't work like that unfortunately okay fuck i'm going to cast sunbeam i'm going to beam in his face it's okay i've got this beam in his face 60 foot right through them can i what scooch over one yeah i'll scooch over one take a side step to line them up they have to make a constitution save well they still take half damage it's 6d8 normally they take full damage and they're blinded it would have been way cooler if it would have worked ooh that's a good roll 26 points of radiant damage then halved and then i'm going to go air elemental form that's cool can i then take whatever movement i have left to try and drag-- i can't use my movement to try and move someone that's an action then i'm going to use my movement to go airborne i think i can go 60 feet let me see my fly speed i have 90 feet yeah i give him a little air poof kick in the face just for flavor he's getting slushied in the face i hope that was right a lot of damage come on yeah grog get me that staff now we have to deal with the two dragons i thought pike had one hit point burn this motherfucker that's pretty good that's okay you guys are at two failed yeah do i get an attack of opportunity here can i do a spell attack on him it's just melee right just one slam attack nope definitely not fucking burn this guy down we're going to live oh fuck come on you guys yes we do you go i'm the one who's good at harvesting i run to percy that's right i don't immediately i'm coming with you to have that conversation i'm coming with you to have that conversation (sighs heavily) i silently go and start harvesting the white dragon let's just hope she stays that way i start harvesting the white dragon as much as i can i try as fast as i can-- wait from who oh my god can i see it i really don't want to
