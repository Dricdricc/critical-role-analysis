percy do you know how much longer we need to continue on this path can we see how far ahead-- does it look like it goes on for a while this chasm you can't leave (all laugh) he does that a lot it might be more mirrors an army with mirrors that's fun it's a start dragonborn you're not picking up tiberius six miles away western side of the mountains shut up pass without a trace i could create a diversion i mean i could-- what's nearby is anything nearby any animals have we seen any wildlife i happen to have hallucinatory terrain right now it means exactly what it sounds like i can make terrain that's not real it could block their view of us i mean i can do a lot of things i can make a thunderstorm i can make a sleet storm i could i could i could make a big storm an athletics check i don't know if i have climbing-- 11 thanks grog bears are good climbers yeah i love that he says 'roll your dice' like it matters 19 i can bird it i can bird it and go in bird in and do a recon mission real quick i'm a bird i'll go bat not in a small-- they have echo vision (laughs) very reasonable eyesight yeah bats come out during the day oh yeah 28 (squawks) that's my echovision how big is this room does it look like it goes deeper like a downgrade i'm gonna go into that-- (all laugh) fear of god i'm going to go into the room that i see is for sure empty and go toward the threshold of the ramp like it's been ransacked or just a really nasty fight like something came in and slaughtered and completely stripped the place can i tell if the blood looks-- how dusty is this shit how much dust goes pff (squawking and coughing noise) investigation what about a 12 all right i'm gonna go ahead and-- are there any other rooms or is this it you said seven stories so it's like room downgrade room downgrade room is there another room going off the bottom room nice flat upper east side land and i'm gonna bamf out of my bat form and say all right it looks like the coast is clear if you guys want to check this place out how dark is it does it look like it's magic-y i can try i'm not as good as he is but i'll try ooh 20 no 18 20 total it's definitely magical what did you find what did you find grog grog those might be centurion birds they might be spies they might be spies inside wait wait wait oh oh but before the crows leave before the crows leave-- can i do something i'm gonna go like storm and i'm gonna sleet storm them i'm gonna start conjuring a sleet storm over the top of this mountain right where the crows are oh jeez i know they're like frozen though right don't they get frozen with sleet storm knocks them prone they're in the sky i wanna hear birds hit the floor i think so yeah but we don't know-- so over here does this graveyard have catacombs tombs underground passages yes (laughs) stop we should do a fly-by do you want to do that distant howling does it sound like wolves can i make a nature check 26 would i think it's weird that they're howling during the daytime odd how long would it take me to fly over if i was a bird you could ride me into town man every time scanlan every time you wanna go invisible and jump on my back and i can eagle up let's do it for half of my druid level we discovered he's got an earpiece i wonder if that's the ground search party we want to keep our good rolls i'm looking at it (choking noises) can i also make a perception check with my eagle vision 14 so that's 24 and i have keen sight which means i have advantage on all perception checks i'll take that 14 as opposed to that one 24 you want to talk to people does it look like there's a central part where there's a lot of people gathered the town square's emptying out all right i'm going to swoop down and find a tree where the five or six farmers are and perch see if scanlan can get a good-- it's just open and empty a rooftop a wall anything i can perch on i perch on the wall i'll keep an-- oh wait i can't see you maybe whistle for me when you come back i can come get you can i see him that's awesome it's a taser arrow i drop my beast shape holding onto a branch yeah yeah i druidcraft some spiderweb hammocks and as usual light some sage maybe take a rope and tie it whoa vax nice helmet don quixote called he wants his bowl back they all appear to be fairly miserable people they did reference sir kerrion by name oh they referenced sir kerrion percy also there was something other really important the town was pretty much empty and that sun tree that what's-his-name-- who said that jarett desmond looks like there were some executions that took place there were about eight bodies hanging from that tree i don't know why do they call it the sun tree can we call pike through your magic poo yeah i can actually find allies in the town that's what i'm thinking yes they're terrified but this whole town's being ruled by fear you killed percy and then what happens after that i know i feel that's the equivalent of putting dish soap in the fountain on prom night yeah we did that what oh wow here's another issue it's going to take me a minute to do the tree it might take a bit well i mean it's one of those things where the longer i do it the better it'll be i can do it for up to eight hours if i do it for up to eight hours i enrich the land over half a mile radius centered on a single point and the land becomes enriched for a solid year yeah i think if i have a solid hour or two hours with it oh well dope would i know stuff like that too then right we're free totally here's my question i feel pike's energy tonight maybe while i'm meditating i can somehow reach out to her and maybe ask her to get in touch with sarenrae and maybe sarenrae can call up her homeboy pelor i don't know we're not organized religion people we ashari hang on what did you just say that thing you just said that no one heard because we were all shouting and arguing rally the townsfolk you want to build a militia it's like attack on titan that's cool i like having the people it feels less like we're the united states a burn on yourself like a brand what yeah something hearty wait wait which plan are we doing first okay yes but the briarwoods knew who you were the briarwoods recognized you instantly what time is it have we gone to sleep or are we waking up are we doing the tree thing right now okay well that's what i was going to say do we want to find operations try and recoup-- if we take a day to get in and get settled i can do a heroes' feast and then i start crack of dawn in the morning all right that's dope can we each take a little bit of time to look more like commoners yeah we do look like quite the motley crew still a failure oh yeah seeming us as opposed to the cows come on a donkey a mule a clydesdale make him look like a milk cow they want it to be really dark as opposed to all of the other things we've done as opposed to sleeping in the underdark can i do some sort of a check from a distance to see if i can recognize what kind of tree it is 18 magical grower okay right don't get emotional so the way the spell works i can do it one of two ways i can do it instantaneously essentially grow up a whole bunch of plants and brush and shrubbery around me or i can wait and i can concentrate for a while and instill a plant with vibrant-- -- life energy and heal the farmlands and it would stretch out for a really far radius i'm gonna probably wanna do more the second one i don't know it's a central point look like it's no big deal 14 oh my god no no no no no no no no it looks like us it's us do they look like us or were they just dressed like us are they made to look like us yeah oh my god oh my god question you said there were eight bodies is there one that looks like a gnome cleric and one that looks like a dragonborn sorcerer but it does mean that it was because of when they saw us in emon-- -- because tiberius wasn't here with the crows it was because of emon so can we get like a vague idea of how long these people look like they might have been here (whispers) fuck i'm not good at this shit oh that you know that wasn't bad woo i'll take that 19 21 why would they put a warning for us here in the city does it look like there's a covering nearby roughly 30 feet or so from the tree i kind of want to talk to the tree does anyone want to come talk to a tree with me all right all right all right all right all right i'm coming i'm coming the saddest brothel ooh can i get an eye as to how far away it is hmm i got an idea actually what are we up to right now are we doing anything are we busy oh there's a cellar i mean i can burrow us a tunnel right now i'm going to do it right now i'm going to cast move earth to the direction of the tree and i want to be careful i don't want to damage the roots of the tree at all so as i start getting closer i want to start looking for the roots of the tree you could always slap it up there and shoot it with a flame arrow how's my burrowing going 200 feet awesome i'm going to clear out a little more area and i'm going to touch the roots and cast speak with plants shut up (kid's voice) the sun is so bright today hey he's cool sometimes sometimes that's what fish say i can bring it back should i i'm a druid that's my-- yeah man yeah it's called plant growth yeah should i okay but it's dead what time is it now should i start it up now i'm going to start my plant growth i'm going to drop can i try to clear out an area where i can-- i should be fine i'm going to strap on my gloves hope you guys are ready for this no it's just going to take a long time actually before i do that can we all have one last meal together and eat a heroes' feast how many did i buy it gets used it's expensive it's $1000 how much gold do we have three bowls i take some of that leftover wine use that to make it fancy wine so you get i believe 2d12 additional hit points on top of your maximum hit points for 24 hours oh i'm sorry 2d10 and you should have- ooh i got two tens we have two more bowls doing that right now just in case the briarwoods decide to come say hello so we're immune to poison-- i'm going to go meditate i'll be back in eight hours what time is it well i'm meditating now i dropped into my meditation-- hopefully nothing happens and y'all don't have to defend me while i'm doing this shit that's what i'm hoping for a tree full of dead us that's fucked up double-dipping yeah that's dugganator steven duggan yeah fellow critter alec go next to the dm yeah yeah
