he's looking at something there's something in there i think caleb has it actually yeah can we repair after that douchebag ability we're a little banged up but we're fine liam and what time is it actually hey matt question do i-- between me and caleb-- who has keen memory-- would we remember how many prisoners were in the stronghold including these guys and escaped how many did we let go including shakäste is that what deliver goods polished means nine delivered okay just making sure we have polished-- does that mean like-- beaten in yeah erased broken someone will keep watch we handed you that haversack healers are like cats you have to have two so they can keep each other motivated so funny (laughing) competition i'm going to lay down and take a short rest as beau's feeling rough tired i'm going to eat some of caduceus's food mushrooms and beans so good is it the thing is it the bag sorry i was napping for a moment what i think we should stay here we can drag mattresses down into the living room light a fire fort party from the bag he just flipped it inside out magic why do these things follow us everywhere looks like there's a handprint on the back oh it is a very good drawing i pull out the red gem and hold it next to the picture does it look like the same ah but you're from the menagerie coast that's when you guys met i gave my beaded bracelet to nott nott you still have my beaded bracelet right the jade beaded bracelet would it work they were like worshiping it just straight intelligence oh boy five bummer ionos matt what was the cult of the caustic heart i'm trying to remember cult of the caustic heart yep yeah yep that's exactly what that was are we going-- (gasps) is it a dope pillow fort yep beau goes out grabs a bunch of pillows from the couches and starts throwing them in hey keg stop talking to me caleb that's not-- that doesn't make anything better yes all the things yes anything i can throw i'll take an errant dagger or two two daggers what i mean i feel like fire is kind of your thing you sure you want me to have this that's true there are like four elements means you're going to be sharing a lot there's going to be a lot of overlap yeah i'll hold on to it where does all this stuff inside of you go you have so much extra storage space in you yeah i know what you mean i poke my head out and i go you owe me a night and i go back in i pop back in and i go i'll be back in like an hour and 20 minutes if it's two hours don't come looking for me if it's two and a half then get worried all right follow keg you just see blankets it's like when the sims i chuckle and roll over and go back to sleep smile as i dig into my pillow medallion of five o'clock shadow oh my god you guys i've never gotten morning after-- (laughter) it's almost as good as the kerrek letter you guys hang on you've got to have the full experience first off for bo spelled wrong i love-- you can see it she was trying to write your eyes are beautiful when you smile i love-- thanks (laughter) i'll cherish this forever i feel like we grabbed it right it's okay we already got in touch with ophelia mardun who was-- yes that's what i was about to say we're doing okay we already got in touch with ophelia who is the woman we were supposed to get in contact with we were like a day or so late but she was fine with it but she wanted us to go kill lorenzo and the rest of the iron shepherds so it was a very convenient killing one group of slavers with one stone he makes dead people tea it's very nice tea cemetery tea honestly you could make a lot of money setting up a shop somewhere and selling tea ophelia first then mollymauk it's all along the way there's some carts around back two to be exact some horses that'll make up for waterloo and-- or water closet and loo and toilet oh yeah by the way we also lost like three horses they're all dead too wc's gone sounds good we steal horses we make a nice little bed for yasha and lay her down can we break down the cages easily or bring the cages off the cart can we get rid of them though i put my hand through the cage bar do i see anything fuck yeah sick i'll take one of the other horses i'll ride a horse that was good snaps for that one happy birthday ashley you could have said it too (singing) ashley come back weird question the carts aren't sprayed on the side with iron shepherds okay cool i'll flip my coat inside out to my brown side and put up the hood i take everything i just said back yeah she's super hot no that's not doable do you have a wider gate around back or something like that you personally he's very personal with the cart um if you don't mind it would actually be greatly appreciated to us if we kept that for the fallen member of our party that's very kind of you you want us to go with you that's right we were supposed to escort her back yep i think hot fuck is actually very appropriate on a few levels i don't know why does she want to leave this can't be good right it's along the way it's not that this was really the job it was more like there were two jobs you had to accept both as opposed to one or the other and the one was doable and we did it and the other one-- well she said the morning eh not at all yeah yeah you guys probably didn't see a lot considering you were in cages when you came through but this is a shitty shit-hole like a really shitty shit-hole you live in a very nice garden an hour north of here the city is garbage you haven't left in 18 years it is very beautiful he is we asked the same question yeah the smell comes with it it's got a little musk yeah when you two mix together it has this meatloaf smell how many people that are sitting with her how many that she wants to sit with her-- sam and okay it's not that we don't care for these animals it's just that we cared for water closet and loo and john way more i just wanted you to know but yeah fuck these horses definitely mamma mia-- i wish you could still read lips yeah i was going to say i do not miss sam riegel giving me shit about my spell usage mm-hmm it's funny i thought you were going to say something like man the empire's sure fucked up i was going to be like right i was just thinking the same thing it's just like what jester said we can read each other's thoughts well you know i'm a monk of the cobalt soul i actually dumped a lot of this on nott she asked we were a little tipsy i was feeling vulnerable in the moment it doesn't happen often she caught me in a perfect window nott did wait-- both nevermind i never intended to be a monk of the cobalt soul my father sent me away to the monastery when i wasn't what he wanted me to be and i was kind of a dick so i ran away from the cobalt soul and they gave me a raise in rank because of it that was kind of cool really just further instilled my rebellion to be totally honest my whole life was dictated by establishment that i didn't have a lot of control over the cobalt soul has this underlying faction that helps uproot corrupt establishment i know i scoffed at the idea of being a part of a system that's supposed to take down systems it doesn't really make sense but you know maybe you if anyone can understand the idea of fighting fire with fire that's why i'm doing this no they just want information i'm out in the world at the ground level people like us tend to have our fingers on the pulse of what's being said around the city sometimes it's not necessarily something that a monk in full accolades can always accomplish yeah does that make you uncomfortable cool ew don't do that (laughter) have we made it outside the city so we're still north of the crispvale thicket i grab jester by the hand and walk her over really right that makes sense i think so too you know i grabbed his stupid cards you want to draw one old faithful (sighs) i put my hand on the other one (whispering) what's he doing what did you just do after a while you lose track of favors it's okay it wasn't a favor though you guys are the only friends i've ever had most people in my life just leave anyone i'm not driving away i guess i should probably try and start keeping people around at this point that is an incredibly random thought and make things better at least three weeks right did you break down the platinum we took about 70 gold i rolled like crap considering it's like i need to speak to the gentleman i have it written down somewhere i'm sure we're fine yeah i go yeah it's this way that's to the bathroom pay day we got a tip yeah we probably should've told you that before we brought you in here is it still an open bar i go to the bar (stage whisper) someone give him a white russian (laughter) if you like milk you'll love this you all right there bud no you don't i'm going to sit down as well sit in a little booth in the back corner back corner boothin' oh god yeah it was honestly-- this is why i don't wear white fjord you survived being chained up and tortured that's got to fuck with a person right fjord you cannot keep blaming yourself when you were the victim in this circumstance you understand that right there are people to blame i wasn't joking when i said it was someone's fault earlier but it is not yours the only person whose fucking fault it was is that fucking asshole lorenzo's and fucking human traffickers there's also no reason that the three of us couldn't have made a fucking plan that couldn't have gotten molly killed what do you want to do yeah how did jester do no offense but she seems like she's a little bit more willfully stronger than you are yep i don't know she looks fucking stoked to me right now yeah you don't drink it because it tastes good eyy if it had to be anywhere i go (yelling) jester nott (yelling) come sit down damn it go like this go (trills) can you feel it can you feel that (gasps) oh man no you don't have to that one place right next to the smut shop that had the really good doughnuts molly would want us to go to the bathhouse (singing) to freedom to the tealeaf now to our new tealeaf oh yeah you talking about experimenting with how many weapons we can see-- so here's my question if we don't turn in the crystal eyeball-- taliesin and if we don't have that does that mean bounty hunters are going to come after you do we see this do we see this happening she's totally flirting with him just to get the goods oh yeah she doesn't actually like want this she just wants to maintain a good relationship yep look she's like mmm please stop touching me hey caleb you're a good friend please don't ever ask me about my sex life i only have gold i don't have checks i light a few cherry bombs and throw them at my friends in celebration for molly (shouting) it's all for molly
