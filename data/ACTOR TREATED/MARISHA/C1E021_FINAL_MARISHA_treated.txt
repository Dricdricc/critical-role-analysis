will you make the little forks dance for me with mage hand okay are you guys ready (singing) be our guest be our guest put our service to the test look i'm making a musical out of our food people pay a lot of money for this i thought that was funny so after we eat all of this food we are cured of all diseases and poisons we become immune to poison and being frightened and all of our wisdom saving throws have advantage also our maximum hit points increase by 2d10 24 hours and you gain the same number of hit points so don't spend any of your hit dice we're going to eat our way to health and it gains the same number of hit points oh okay i see what it means why did you burn all of your sorcerer points we told you not to burn all of your sorcerer points we don't have time to sit here and take a full rest you can ask the group but i have a feeling that vax and thorbir aren't going to want to take a full rest down here 24 hours so we can still take a long rest and still have benefits from the feast it lasts for 24 hours i actually have a locate creature spell i can do it well the cleric is burned out of 4th-level spells cleric is good can i get another healing spell then cashew oh that would be great so what are those 2d8 i did 8d4 (quietly) let me get more d4s out i'll do this twice that will be enough four five six seven eight nine oh that's good eight so that's 15 19 22 plus

acid oh wait we brought the flying carpet with us it's in your bag of holding why don't we pull that out acid pit [break] yes we all fit on it right oh we took a short rest i could we have flying carpets okay we all fit we're good let's go onward i make a nice little wind zephyr to give us a little airflow 19 could i do a history check why not 12 wisdom saving throws continue oh my god can i
