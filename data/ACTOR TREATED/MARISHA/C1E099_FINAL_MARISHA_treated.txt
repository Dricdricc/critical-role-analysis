oh my god right now and we'll be like we used to hang out with him before he was famous did you really i just remembered it was your birthday i do still have some spells left it depends on what you want to do though and what i have prepared i can i have a few options for that i can do a hallucinatory terrain which i could do right now because i do have it learned it covers a 150-foot cube which i don't know-- how wide is the hole well we can if we gather them in one place are they attracted to anything like shiny things or movement so they're attracted to movement and sound percy you have a very loud banging thing if we can get them all clumped together i can throw down a few fireballs and flaming spheres and probably take a lot of them out but i need them clumped together are they still on the walls not all of them but i can get a lot of them yeah we can fireball together i point to a spot for percy to see if i can get them to gather there and i start readying a fireball to launch okay let me know when it looks like a good cluster yeah let's just throw down a big ol' fireball 20-foot radius hey vax do you still have any of that-- a hundred episodes yeah five years a hundred episodes later do you still have any of that poison that poison-- anybody have any poison you have poison well i was thinking-- that's pretty good grog well no ah another time i'll raincheck you bud do we still have any more orc or boar parts yeah like actual raid like raid like if we dip maybe some food in poison and throw it down there everyone that's left will come and eventually eat it and die i could-- i do still have my sixth-level spell i could attempt to get to a few of their tunnels and collapse their tunnels i could-- hm no not really i can create water but i don't think it would be enough to flush them out i mean you volunteered it very quickly is that remnants of dork still if i do like a commune with nature and then because i know they're already-- commune with nature and i-- i thought that was conjure fae can i because i already got a map of their tunnels can i then do move earth to like try and collapse you're going to fire storm them plus technically isn't the point of a mine to like dig out holes do you think he has friends he's always alone and you should know that if you've apparently been watching us do i recognize this spell okay you're totally right he has so many friends wow that was weird you guys it was weird it is now your house you're a homeowner you get to pay property taxes i get the big cushion display furniture sucks i do yeah yes why fine it can make alcohol and poison but it can't make an english breakfast bullshit yeah breakfast ale that works she seems nice hi cash it in i feel like we could find better stew no offense so proud i understand legacy and responsibility and i think it's very admirable of you to recognize your place a year ago it was definitely true but now yeah you're definitely the face guy you're the good salesman you can sell anyone on a shitty cake that you baked i can come get you i mean to be fair tary does have a point i also have a responsibility and i'm the chief of my people oh no this is probably a tree stride situation let's do that whatever that one sorry that's the fifth level one the sixth level teleport transport it is tree stride just rolls off the tongue easier tree uber on the way out i give the sun tree our secret handshake it's so slow what's happening though really it's a farmer's market hi i need some fresh halibut right now is there flowers is there a flower shop like the festival yeah just go with it chode what are we all paying attention at this point so wait he does know jokes or he does know the meat man but you don't know jokes do you know parchment boulder shears never mind what is he pulling a dread pirate roberts does he wear a beret marquet ank'harel bigger than marquet ank'harel (gasps) we're getting closer oh my god we'll take the tongues potion how much come on give it to me what i don't have that much is it under a thousand gold then goodbye we're getting out of his store front can we call you lion for short that's fierce i'm keyleth keyleth nice to meet you hang on a second will you earmuffs he knows what earmuffs are that's good anyway why would scanlan send a messenger he has the gate stone and why him scanlan's smarter than that right chode look a lot of people could go by the alter-ego meat man good point look he's still doing it he does follow directions well lionel not good oh no selling the secret recipe man oh no wait he said marquet though i guess it depends on what he thinks it's worth to us what makes you think that we want this information so much what what what'd he say allura what is happening that's not bad right we had a friend who we thought it might've been him sorry i'm sorry you think that the title of meat man is so important that you had to kill or attack a gnome who also went by meat man so you've taken on the title yourself and what city is he in chains beneath he's totally dread pirates roberts-ing this shit here's a question why did allura come to you for information right so you have ears in all the right places what if we gave you money and food and mutton how much money does he give you you could recruit him the problem is that once he has the designs he can replicate them we've met a lot of doom-seers you sure you can stand up to them can i do an insight check to see if i can glean any more of what he knows about this world-ending thing natural 20 is he still walking away i look at vex and vax and them and i say we know him there's something familiar about him he knows more than he's letting on motherfucker motherfucker motherfucker motherfucker natural 20 come on vex no i bust through right behind vax you dick i knew you were familiar no one talks about scanlan being handsome as much as scanlan does that was your first giveaway mister yeah you're so good at that why did you want the designs are you a mafia don scanlan are you a bad guy i pull chod chard chode lionel i pull lionel aside and i grab him by the face and i say we need you to be coherent and honest during this and i cast enhance ability and give him owl's wisdom it increases your wisdom you get advantage on wisdom is it though scanlan scanlan there are some hurt feelings in this room and it might be time to address those i'm chief of my people i did i wish you were there i mentioned you and everything in my speech yeah yeah does she like you now and what kind of operation do you operate and to whom do you sell these things you're doing great what were they throwing in he stole it from you no you gave it to him so you're just here to be an errand boy that's all you want to help us out you traveled to a separate hemisphere to be a messenger did you not feel like you had a purpose when you were with vox machina i'm not judging you in the moment you know there is a point that we are all family but we are also all friends and there is that old saying be careful of the friends that drag you down maybe we were dragging you down you know you've broken a lot of hearts scanlan i think you're still a heartbreaker and i leave with them can we go to sleep now everyone's emotionally tired what the orb in ank'harel are we all talking over our headpieces i think that's what we're doing he's a dick he can hear us i know the range of these things are we supposed to be angry or sad or happy i don't know what all these feelings are all at once can i yeah he needs a stiff drink and security blankets it stops here it stops at the camera line grog don't kill him grog don't kill him keyleth is just watching intently and more importantly watching grog making sure he doesn't actually beat him to death we'll stop this if it gets bad off a duck's back it's going down in the whole foods parking lot oh because he has a second what would chode do i've never seen grog walk away from a fight he's not fine what are you talking about that was good chocolate milk chocolate's expensive here just drink it first the idiot has a point oh hey tary you're still here i know you're not wrong i did what do we do hey chode sorry chard where did you come from before you met scanlan just let him tell his story yeah how'd you know they were ducks normally ducks don't live in the desert they were ducks the ducks blessed you and your birth and your survival he doesn't know what a vulture is (chuckles) that's a continent but-- oh wait no the continent-- no marquet is the continent ank'harel is the city okay that's fair i've earned that family he talked a lot of family to you and ducks did he talk much more about his family to you we like you we like you chode lionel we like you lionel hey

more weeks but one of these days i will have to be getting back very soon oh this is like a one-channel frequency we can all hear you yeah definitely yeah something like this is better done in person as opposed to over a communication device nope you should not what do the ducks say the same reason why pigeons are in costco okay hi scanlan again yeah you can go to ank'harel but we'll be right behind you i guess we know who you are now aes agus to ank'harel in the morning then because i'm trying to sleep you motherfuckers the clasp is rusted from when we were in the water plane i can't take it off it's stuck there we'll see him there you could come with us i said if you run away we'll still find you yay chode lionel like if people didn't think we had a writer's room before they definitely are now this feels like a marketing campaign
