out there still the shark with the boat if you guys want to run the keys are in the car the engine's warmed up ready to go i've got the key turned on it's nice and cozy that's such a good roll though that's a good initiative roll 20 we're all over ten though that's pretty good guys we should be proud of that yeah i guess i feel percy unhook and i start the forward momentum pointing that direction oh no trinket run aw that's cute (laughing) follow the macy's day balloon shark if someone crocheted us a little single-square magic carpet so we could put it on our little floaty deal i'm going to use a run action just double speed i feel action above and i'm just shark instincts yeah i have a swim speed of 40 including me i'm in the water yeah come on oh come on (cheers) i can make one sam taliesin and oh well i was going to say we could go into this cave here well what about this cave we need a rest laura and i want to be able to use my scrying spell before we try anything sure can i use my shark eyes to look down the tunnel (singing) to be a shark man matt orion and i drop them off at the beach that's not true it's +1 oh i was looking at mine it's okay 17 i go ahead and un-shark myself i'm wet that was a really cold lake pike can you check-- i can what if this is a clue or something important what if there's something in this cavern that could help us though we could how about this how about i do what scanlan says yes i know i think this is the first time i've said this ever maybe i'll try what scanlan says and i'll turn into a rock elemental and just bamf in there and see if there's anything good and if it's bad i'll just run out and make a rock wall maybe okay let's do it i like it i'm going to go ahead and cast enhance ability on myself before i do that and give myself extra wisdom i want to be a perceptive bastard while i'm in there rah burrow beneath i'll go (deep voice) bye-bye oh yeah wait have you guys seen this one (all laugh) i'll take the elevator with advantage right that's a 13 that's a 19 i'll take that one 29 can i take a piece of rock and toss it up arcana all right i've got a vague number 11 wait plus four 15 i used scanlan's die a grick but they're not necessarily bleeding through from the other plane they come from this plane big worms with tentacles but not too weird i'm just going to seep back down i take the stairs but before i reappear i go grog i'm in a boat (all laugh) no i'm not an elemental anymore i go tee-hee-hee shh it seemed like it had dimension door properties but i don't know if it was necessarily at full dimension door strength there were creatures there appeared to be these things that i've heard of called gricks they're like worms with beaks and tentacles yeah they're super-fast they did this whole hungry hungry hippos thing it seemed to be some sort of dimensional gateway i don't know which dimension into the temple the grick things yeah if we take a few minutes and i take another breather-- because being a rock elemental takes it out of you for a little bit-- and you guys can make some bombs i can go back in there as an elemental i'm going to rest while they talk while they figure out a plan here give it to me and i'll go in as an elemental yeah could we cast silence the far realm like completely cave it in i don't think throwing up a stone wall is going to necessarily stop k'varn i can spend time essentially collapsing the whole thing it's been longer it was 6 or 7 hours when we were on that side of the thing there's still things i want to do clarota do you have anything that might assist me in a scrying spell to help spy on k'varn maybe something in his image do you know what he looks like well i guess while we wait for him to respond i'm going to start using all of my stone shape and i'm going to start bringing down this tunnel just start collapsing it on the outskirts of the island i'd assume anything helps aberration in the center wait what thank you i was taking notes a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet (chuckle) of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions (thunder crack) under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally (soft chuckle) born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics it is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in tal'dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do (clears throat) anyways it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must embark on journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one thought plays in repeat in her mind is she even worthy i've been collapsing that cavern okay tiberius has your brother gotten back to you yet is there any type of stone or rock or debris with the residual energy from the purple mists of the far realm okay not yet i'm going to sit down near where the far plane portal is i want to be near it though right yeah so i can be close to it and clarota pike do any of you want to help me in this i'm going to do my scrying spell can i say that because i prepared it i can be like here's my book you can borrow it i wrote it down i know you know it scanlan can you give me some meditation music what why he knows we're here already he possessed the queen and said welcome you're my treasured guests remember that he knows exactly where we are he seems to be pretty powerful and all-knowing i'm pretty sure he probably knows we're fucking here he said you are our treasured guests i wrote it down he knows we're coming he wants us to come oh good job grog you did it besides we're talking about moving anyway right so i might as well do it here if we're going to relocate plus i want to be near the energy of the far realm maybe it'll help a little bit it's what i'm hoping for so wait do i get two inspiration dice okay but i'm happy because of grog right and i want to meditate specifically on the horn and i want to use pike and see if i can channel her vision focusing on the horn since that's what we really know it's pretty much the only thing we know what it looks like oh come on do i still have my enhance ability up 27 ow christ what-- why you were in pain so i thought i'd fucking slap you across the face gee sorry wow orion and k'varn's a beholder not only is k'varn a beholder k'varn has been experimenting on himself and so he has armor grafted onto him and the horn the horn which-- i don't know yes that big green light can we can see it is it like the luxor in vegas can we see the green light it's like an arcane prison around all of the elder brain clarota do you know how we could possibly break this prison oh man each eye tends to have a beam that has a different ability it's a magic fun bag it's probably got everything from silence and dispel magic to petrify to a disintegration ray it seemed to be emanating from the top opening of this pyramid that was the main temple of the center of town it was almost like a beehive it was focusing the energy we don't know actually i can learn heat metal and i can heat the beam and make it (clicks her tongue) beam yeah i'm assuming-- oh go ahead underwater fight it's his laboratory well we've got the acid thing and maybe grog can-- i like percy's idea we've got that acidic vial well i can always be an eagle and i can maybe fly or maybe grog could carry a big boulder that way after the acid has-- he could throw a big boulder to collapse it the rest of the way wait the bomb we just threw in that room yeah there's no need for us to relocate now wait why we can do reconnaissance from where we are we've got a magic carpet it's literally never been a problem but we're not all going for reconnaissance are we okay well then you guys go check it out first okay so we'll start boating over yeah i'm going to take the boat awesome trees are bad i actually go collect a few of the vines hanging from the trees 16 i wanted to collect some no i'll wait i thought we were next to a tree or a really big thing yeah yeah how many shirts do we have left 14 grog crush aww so sweet happy birthday that's so sweet yay zandor thanks zofer confirmed we still need to fix that yeah i'm half-elven we'll totally take brooches fish are friends not food aww we fought a manta ray if you go to our website it filters through but as long as you hashtag critical role-- we'll be able to find it yeah axis huzzah congrats david scotty doesn't know (laughs) yes you're gazlowe i didn't know that christ 4 am good morning guten morgen

dance while setting up for the q&a 1034 wow that's huge well (laughs) god i got asked this question at the panel over the weekend too it's a hot topic everyone wants to know how i killed the kid well we were fighting-- tell us about the fight so basically a sorcerer neverland ranch and we actually found these clippers for the chain we were like sweet clippers pocket keep going and then we get to this emperor with these giant gold chains and we're like how do you break these gold chains if only we had clippers oh well we don't so there was one so we were trying to get these kids away from us because we don't want to hurt them but we wanted them away so i used a grasping vine and i was trying to yank the kid away but the grasping vine attached to the chain instead of the kid so with the chain at the collar around his neck when the vine yanked-- oh that's right i should have grabbed the chain but instead-- hey there was a few of us with family ties over here as well and over here all these people with royal family ties can't be a part of the shits what have you been doing for the last ten years keyleth well again ten neutral good (laughs) is that better it's a long story and the ability to work in your pajamas who me i don't have a holy symbol not a druid thing i like the earth i worship the earth no deities yeah tell geek & sundry to take us there my first game was with you but then i've done other games since and i came back for this one i've had some frustrating dms too in los angeles there is no age only age rages age rages travis and i would like to age rage (sing-song) i will never tell i'm 18 to 30 may birthdays i know you're going to get motion sick-- oh that's amazing that's awesome oh did you guys do that on camera that's so cute it's adorable people are now asking how we met it was supposed to be snl but geeky nerdy stuff where we were going to write and perform our own sketches that never happened yeah you got me an audition for resident evil and then i was like i owe you a drink yeah wait you and trinket yeah i want to hear it trinket hardwick vin diesel that would be hilarious steve blum eminem yeah we've had a run-in once-- soul transfers no i don't think i've seen you stand up so fast has anyone permanently died at any point that got us in a lot of trouble oh there was also the time you slapped trinket on the ass and i think you were sleeping on the couch that night demon blood yeah it's your interpretation we want to see different interpretations oh really i didn't know you felt-- how much do you write and how much do you improv i mean someone said how much do we write and how much do we improv everything the players do is improv we used to play for eight hours people are saying to make them longer a drunk episode question worst possible enemy to fight probably a beholder someone asked how the party met in-game that's a good question yeah it was so sad (laugh) it's on liam's vine if you go find liam's vine there's a five-second clip of all of us just screaming bloody murder yeah i remember you saying you'd had a bad week too that's right you were going to go somewhere oh that's right because didn't you have guests you had people who were visiting you and you went back and you're like (cries) you don't understand we start killing gods it's hard to pick i don't know i have a soft spot for grog i like percy too i'm not going to lie percy as a character finger mustache yeah pike's great they haven't met gilmore we come in christmas pajamas i still have the pine cones you gave me oh i love your dice thing you have a dice graveyard you should auction them you should auction all your graveyard dice the dice god i did get a custom die someone asked me what my favorite animal to turn into was i'd have to say it was probably my tiger my saber-toothed tiger minxie form which grog named because grog and i went on a-- we went on an intimidation mission and i was his pet tiger minxie rngesus what would rngesus do ravenclaw no gryffindors in this bitch get out gryffindor get out we love you he's destroying the illusion have we ever thrown a total curveball at you where you've had to do that where you've had to be like uh uh like that time we sneaked in the back door of the thieves' guild slytherin (laughs) i know it's been two years and we don't know yeah (laughs) yes that was a good one though was that the same time where i ran at the wall and started foaming at the mouth we basically took the insanity plea to get me out of prison as a team how do you mean tabletop all tabletop yeah we like magic the gathering settlers of catan i think the four of us here are all warmachine hordes players yeah there's also d&d board games branded d&d board games that are fun mini dungeon delvers they're fun do whatever you want it's awesome fun imaginative world yeah that's true yes that was fun yeah it just kept getting more and more involved congratulations everyone should try d&d the world would be a better place with more d&d it was a while before i told you guys i was a princess on the website rping that guy which i think is why percy is one of my favorite characters like as our character in-character keyleth would probably have a mountain lion keyleth likes cats and she lived in the mountains so something native would have been mountain lion-y it's been an hour going back to the question of my favorite thing about d&d because that kind of got segued out aside from the people i think that it's something really fantastic-- not to sound cheesy-- and magical when a group of grown adults can get together and use their imagination and have an amazing time and my favorite thing about dungeons & dragons is when you walk away from it and especially after you've slept on it and after you meditate on it it's pretty much real it's just as real as other things we do in our day-to-day lives if you guys noticed how excited we got when we were like oh my god you guys haven't met gilmore yet and all of us went oh my god gilmore and we all got excited over an npc yeah i do too yeah i have dreams because for us gilmore is real and pike is real which is why we all fucking cried our eyes out when pike died no what's your favorite part of d&d orion it's weird too because i almost feel like bringing the game public and for everybody else and the fact that we're doing it weekly it's almost bled the reality lines even more because now they are like oh yeah totally clarota yeah we totally know who you're talking about and so we're like yeah clarota right you guys know clarota and we're getting fan art (laughs) yeah it's true yeah and they stay young forever i might have to bring in a dwarf it might be time well (swedish accent) oh you mean this dwarf orion and (same accent) this dwarf accent (all laugh) (same accent) hello hello welcome to kraghammer (same accent) where's the d20 (gasps) critters step up it's pretend as adults totally if you can find a group of friends that you can openly play d&d with without them judging you bondage friends
