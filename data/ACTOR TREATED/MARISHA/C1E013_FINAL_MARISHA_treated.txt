some more dice take it take it give it to her please what does go bold i'm going to take the rest of my burrow speed to get up to the top i'm assuming i'm there okay drop earth elemental would you say-- theoretically our brains are made up of water right would you say that there is water in the like jello brain mold like water molecules would be in it okay i don't know much in terms of arcana but i can try ten okay i'm going to cast control water i'm going to assume that there's water it's 300 feet i got the range and i'm going to take the brain where it's already kind of sliced down the middle where vex has already made progress i'm going to take it and i'm just going to rip it apart okay 23 i'll take it i'll take it they'll have a really bad hangover tomorrow ooh just 3d6 or plus

i am going to-- okay wait trinket's stunned wait shove him no i can't shove him okay can i do this okay here's what i'm going to do i'm on the carpet i'm going to cast grasping vine from the carpet and wrap around trinket and have a trinket tow vine let's go can i now use the rest of my movement to be like-- okay i'm just holding stupid wrench run oh we're not in greyskull so we're somewhere in emon so we could be in someone's living room right now hi we will totally do that when we know-- oh my god keyleth just goes down on her knees and starts kissing the ground oh we're home look stars i was going to say what bars are open we should get some ale wait maybe we should drop off the bag of holding so we're not carrying it around and then go out drinking yes exactly exactly oh we've got time yes let's do that pub crawl we're going to pub crawl back to the keep we lived a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet (chuckle) of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions (thunder) under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally (soft chuckle) born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics it is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in tal'dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do (clears throat) anyways it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy no shayne is that shayne or wait is that jarett oh it is shayne i was right the first time shayne we have shayne cordell jarett kendrick and nitebe jarett i think so i didn't write that part down starving it's quite comfy sleeping like an animal we might want to let them know that's interesting well why don't we do some research i mean this was the first time to be fair we also did sort of release the mind flayers from their evil dictator okay well the thing we then need to immediately decide before we un-stone lady kima is what're we going to do with the horn before we un-stone lady kima why don't we just wake up tiberius okay hang on hang on that's true she did send us after kima so what if they're both on the side that we don't-- don't we have a safe didn't we build a safe in our keep i just feel like if it's so terrible why does she want it for herself right because no one of the church has ever been bad before i undo his polymorph i undo his polymorph sam and by polymorph can i release polymorph by using polymorph scanlan come on we need to talk to him scanlan he's nipping scanlan tiberius is nipping please i told you it's nice being cuddly we're all still drunk and awake we don't want to go to bed yet just just talk with us tell us a story we haven't talked to you in a week that's true see i'm with him and you died and come back to life by the way we haven't talked about that what was it like on the other side oh i'm sorry i'm a little tipsy well here's my thing even if she has good intentions say she has good intentions and maybe they just wanted to bring the horn back to study it and no one should be messing with this whatsoever then why don't we just agree to not hand it over i kind of like that plan we need to decide do we tell her that we destroyed it or do we tell her that we just didn't get it and that it's still down there well hang on it's in the bag of holding right now i mean we could stone shape it and i could like stone shape it and bury it somewhere in our keep wait you're talking about just taking a stroll through the forest with the horn of orcus i turn i go minxie and i curl up by the fire you can curl up with me actually is there a bath house in the village we should have a girls' day at the bath house wait are we unfreezing her taliesin and no i thought we were going to talk to allura first oh wait that's right and we were going to do that thing that's right i was probably tipsy sorry we came up with like eight plans last night i just get the leftover mashed potatoes from breakfast whisper time sweet sweet whispers how many subscribers away are we 38 subscribers travis marisha and that is still a lot okay pike so kima pie-in-the-sky goal you would destroy the horn just within range that was for all of us oh we have one of the best defense mechanisms grog i use my druidcraft as he enters to make little sparkles and lightning bugs appear around him grog we lived holy shit we lived crazyballs oh yeah we had two sparkles and a green one sweet aw that's a good idea that's fun awesome (sing) slow your mustang down we're your morning show closing shifts are the worst that's where all of our crits were going take the disc out
