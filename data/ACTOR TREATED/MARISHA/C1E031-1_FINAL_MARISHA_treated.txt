12 okay shit are there any other windows along the back side of the house through the side no other windows shit okay i'll go inside is there anything in this direction this way can we not get this way do we know if there are any outside doors over here on this side could i have gone around the edge here to see would we have known going on this side if there were any doors and we still have no way into this main room either yet okay i'm sorry i'm an asshole (giggling) i turn into an asshole were there any-- fuck i really don't want to have to blow-- okay so i'm going to--- yeah you know what i didn't go inside i'm outside dick all right okay fine i'll just see if this fucking door is open that's all i can do right now yeah sorry guys excuse me sorry excuse me okay can i cross over to that window and look out the front window the window over here do i see any fire from scanlan that's my turn oh yeah can i call him can i (whispering) scanlan scanlan son of a bitch all right shoot out the window that's better that's not bad though yes dukes of hazzard as he slides over the table in front of me i go that was pretty awesome bye good luck trinket i'm coming okay so seeing vax go over the table and being like that was cool i'm also going to be like (grunts) over the table i'm going to join the dukes of hazzard train damn it that's not bad acrobatics 17 so i'm going to come in and i see a headless dude with mist swirling around him someone could yell at me to do it okay this one yes it is just with my modifier wait is this a saving throw just my modifier so 17 well i know what i want to do but i can't do it without feeling guilty i was going to sunbeam this bitch what makes sense that i wouldn't know i would just see a black mist well if i saw a black mist what i would probably do realistically is think it was some sort of poison shit and i would wind wall it so i'm going to (goosh) wind wall that mist (weakly) it's what i would assume it was but i might be aiding it in getting away this is bullshit i wind wall it to keep essentially do the wind wall-- yeah around grog yeah i'd want to protect him from the crossbows and then i once again go scanlan scanlan yeah i'm going to back into the corner and keep this wind wall up so am i encapsulating the mist in my wind wall i'm kind of trapping the mist in a half-circle yeah but is it stuck in the wall okay that it does that's my motherfucking wind wall it's coming in handy sorry it's a wall of wind how much it could be worse that's six plus four so ten you can get through the wind wall well i mean it's going to save a bear right after i punched him with the wind 15 foot high okay so i'm going to keep maintaining this wind wall and wrap it up around the mist to double-enforce it and i'm going to scream what is this does that count i'm not metagaming i'm legitimately asking whether this counts (weakly) oh great i'll drop the wind wall and cast sunbeam and eyes flashing light just (goom) right in the concentrated beam where i have this mist there and stuff that's my turn why do i have to ask for forgiveness i can use my bonus action to heal somebody if someone wants it actually how about this i used my bonus action to ask what the shit was this does that make you feel better bless you oh god you killed grog how many's left they were trying to haul ass out they're going to try and flee aren't they eat it make them all eat it do i kill him or do we keep him is he coming back inside is that a window i'm up against behind me i'm just going to go excuse me excuse me trinket sorry and i'm going to peek around the door and go (shkoof) and sunbeam him that guy that scared-shitless guy it's what i just did six it's a concentration spell it's a concentration spell i can keep doing it for a minute yeah it's pretty dope 16 that's 23 plus 30 damage radiant damage (lightning noise) since i'm outside on the threshold of the house can i see where scanlan might have lit up the other house yet 17 okay i stay standing outside just staring out into the distance waiting for scanlan's cue yeah i know which is what we were technically supposed to do one leg 27 fuck
