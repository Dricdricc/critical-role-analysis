i love the shade she threw you in her spare time what is that i didn't know you played no you have to do it every month it's really obnoxious it's free everyone asks if it supports us we get a lesser cut or more cut it supports us the exact same way and beau jester fjord (laughs) whack you gave me holy oil and you holy oil it's a like a splash grenade it was guinevere where do you-- why heart do i notice any textures on any walls they talked about the north side of the wall being more textured and having a pattern try the north side we're on a jet ski this is great (whispers) we're on pirates of the caribbean have you been practicing any of the techniques that we tried out sure that's good oh that's cool we did bad nine nine it's okay it's not that big a deal so it did like an ink cloud okay i'm going to go (mild screaming) and do a straight whack on it sorry fjord it's on you ooh that's a natural 19 25 what is it 1d-- that's not great six damage did i hurt you okay (whack) i deck him right across the face yeah i'll take that 16 okay seven damage ah one more i'm going to do flurry of blows that's a natural 17 that's a four eight damage uh-huh sorry okay is the one still next to me that was attacking fjord oh there's one on caleb he's still on top of him i'm probably not within five feet yeah that's what i'm saying i'm going to do some cool monk shit i'm going to-- (confused battle cry) continuing on i'm going to leap across and see if i can do a jump and a slap with the staff on top parkour 14 i'm going to swing upwards yep that's a natural 16 so 21 i don't know why i rolled that die that's not necessary nine damage i take my staff and i wipe it on caleb sorry are you all right your head's okay yeah the oil's working for you yeah very dapper eventually full winklevoss twins you're feeling guilty for calling him rock-face but not for telling him to eat shit i like that that's great drinking a drink with cold ice we were looking for a collapse a change in texture this is it they said that the glowing orbs that made the men collapse were purple that's a nice sconce i'm always a fan of going down what i'll take up the rears i have no chill you talk to me two minutes later i don't think so rogue shit ball bearings you stole from me definitely a puzzle i feel like this is going well i'll hold up the back i want to look around and see if i see anything that looks of value i'll take that natural one and give another $100 to 826la wait up for me miss i want to catch it knowing it's coming 1d10 plus eight (groan) wait how many 11 i caught it argh those are from earlier it's this thing oh shit look how cool yeah you said this was pretty big can i do a check to see if i recognize any of these things i can use my mystical erudition to spend a ki point i get advantage on this 18 cool yeah it's like magic people code the people i learned from were super into this shit i think it's a puzzle i feel like this thing rotates and we have to match the symbols on the bottom to the symbols that match the school of magic it feels like the divination is a full symbol of the star evocation right then the diamond-- what would the diamond be i bet there's a key i'm going to start looking around digging seeing if i see anything that looks like it would fit the shape i'm also going to shout out be careful the shifty three were talking about an octagonal room where they got attacked maybe we've got to go all the way back up to the top the spiral staircase we need a down here team and an up here team and maybe a frumpkin to communicate through that looks like it would fit in the rod okay okay 16 you work so fast the stairs are back through the hall and up right they're not in these chambers it's one big chamber all right i'll jog up the stairs oh sorry get it girl travis marisha and (singing) to the front to the side to the back disarm that trap hey can i keep that i think i can throw it later thank you thanks nott oh sorry here's your thumb back i just want the bolt yeah who's going up i have a feeling there's going to be a lever-y or a move-y situation yeah you might need opposable thumbs sorry i'll take the front any ghosty globbies natural 20 okay on the ground okay are they like profiles or are they front looking up deadless okay copy sorry absorbing a lot at once keep going i relay all of that of course i do and we can see it-- sorry we can see a closer of the dome with the symbols on them oh we're not there yet sorry we're just up the spiral staircase i'm assuming it's through the collapsed tunnel right okay got it that feels like that might be a trap ooh all of them here we go i would be probably be in between fjord and caleb 22 little shits they what is that true copy nein miss okay you want to go first girl 15 didn't did you try to shoot it okay seeing nott have a hard time i'm going to pull out that holy water and i'm going to like a confetti popper i want to right over its face just break it yeah just straight attack with my dex to throw it even though i'm not throwing it i'm not throwing--the holy water i'm trying to break it with my hand and palm in its face 12 is it a dex saving throw okay do i still get my bonus attack natural 19 25 eight damage do i punch a ghost okay a little cold yep does that mean i get to make an opportunity strike against it that's okay that's okay 21 another eight points yeah go nice that's what we do i know i don't feel so bad for making fun of them now i feel like maybe we were hard on them but now i don't think we were okay we can keep going for the boatman holy shit that's awesome beau hollers out hey i think you figured out that puzzle let it fall whenever we get done with the short rest can beau start peeking through and digging away at the collapsed entrance into that tunnel it wasn't good six slow going was there a little crawl space at the top that we could crawl through well it's just me and i rolled shitty the ceiling is through here and it's blocked by a bunch of rubble we can try and dig through it if we think something should be up there all right i've been like small boulders i've been (struggling) if the thing goes two clicks-- correct it goes there so wait divination evocation necromancy and elemental things right isn't evocation-- fire lightning elemental things something bad might happen once we turn this so be on guard i'm going to join molly i think someone needs to be upstairs you guys stay yeah i got you one better i'll shove in my staff and push against the pillar and use it as leverage see if i can pry it open ooh natural 18 22 you see this is like a simple-- sorry it's like a simple tool sorry i drooled a little what you know what that's fair i'll take that that was a good one it was a good jab we heard you wait but you did necromantic right maybe it's a trial maybe we have to fight all of them i'm going to use my boots at this point 20 to 15 negative no sentinel bitches they suck you up it's bad i don't know we attack at advantage for how long is it concentration don't break that concentration jell-o do we just slap jello i'm going to do a full-on-- yeah doing a full-on jello shot that's good that's an 18 plus six so 24 seven plus four 11 no okay i'll go for the 20 in case i roll a natural 20 i did not roll a natural 20 does it feel like i did some damage okay i'll take my bonus and whack or you know what yeah i'm going to whack it slap that jello travis and that's good that's 21 six damage it's like that pins and needles thing yeah like dead arm it's a little dead where's yasha can i go around near frumpkin and flank it that's good that's fine and i hit it with sentinel at advantage i rolled a 15 six damage yeah these are all my unarmed strikes yeah i hate that feeling yeah what was it like 79 points of damage you did in one round yeah that was great did any of that trigger my sentinel it didn't move out of my range at all it got a natural 20 and that i wouldn't have-- okay i already got my one reaction i feel like that was before though the one reaction the first one with it being one more round do i have a reaction it's me and yasha i did on the round before i feel like i have one more round but i don't think i did did you though because it moved out of your range but did yasha oh she ran out of range okay i was thinking there was another round in between that i'm going to lay into it wait wait caleb you already went you're going to give it to her okay then i'll lay into it sorry i wanted to make sure someone was going to get jester out 21 that's nine points of damage i'm going to go ahead and do flurry of blows for these next two that's a natural 18 so five points of damage the second one that's not great that's 11 great and that's seven points of damage aw frumpkin hey buddy well if you hit all with everything at once then the worst that can happen is that we have to fight two more things at the same time liam well jester did necrotic and i can obviously handle well i can handle evocation or-- so we have to do it all at once beau takes off her belt i take off my belt and i hold it up like a rally car racer girl (silence) three two one (swishing) come on i still have this holy water too which ones which portions yes and enchantment we put bowls-- no all right yes me and fjord will stand by in case anything else drops out of the ceiling yasha you want to take another point fighters and casters this was a research facility for mages they're super uppity about this shit yeah i pull off the belt again one two three on the other side beau's left behind going come on pick it up caleb jester you should always look out for yourself first all right i am waiting behind motherfucker i am in-between you and them and i'm going come on come on caleb i love you but we are missing out on other shit i'm having extreme fomo right now come on no more ten minutes i'm definitely going to write it down it's the sword it's the fucking sword yeah from ashes shall rise again are we going to fight some guy who's going to chop off our legs it talked about chopping off our legs yeah the trophy was a warning he lost his legs i tried to write as much as i could maybe we should run i was going to say i don't think we've achieved anything he wanted us to bring back any type of ancient research that we could find but we could keep any of the spoils
