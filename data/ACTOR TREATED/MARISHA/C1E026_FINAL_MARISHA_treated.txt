we'll have prints in my head you're like those mr wooly magnetic toys when you're a kid i liked her bow it was cute i'm really worried about him out of curiosity did anyone else hear him-- did anyone else just happen to hear what he said in that fight last night it was after that actually never mind it's hard to say you know percy i don't know where he gets these lines jeez okay this is getting really off subject it was when he was screaming the cluster of things as he was shooting that mercenary in the face and he said what are you doing you have no reason to be here your soul is now forfeit really that last part is the most important one the first stuff is fairly average but yeah your soul is now forfeit i thought it was maybe a line and then it seemed really aggressive and strong and specific so it made me think a lot i don't know we haven't seen him since that happened i think he's not telling us everything that's for sure yeah but screaming your soul is now forfeit that's not a secret that's saying you peed the bed when you were a kid oh really sure but he wasn't screaming this at the briarwoods he was screaming this at a random mercenary what does that mean to what yeah that's actually another thing i wanted to talk about that was also really intense you know i get it it was a hard day it was a hard day and we tend to get a little aggressive sometimes after hard days we've all been there but he didn't just murder an old woman he chainsawed her a sleeping unconscious woman you also were the only other one who seemed to be confused as to what was going on that's what i'm saying that was good that was nice that might exactly be what i'm saying man you see this is why i like you scanlan you're so much better at the words than me i don't think i even knew that's what i felt until you said it just now i just don't want us to-- she was a really old woman sure but she was unconscious yeah she didn't really do anything at all i'm not saying she wasn't a threat and i'm not saying we shouldn't handle threats i'm saying maybe we shouldn't dissect a woman with a spinning krull blade who's sleeping on the ground defenseless running away she was fleeing how do you plan to use your items for better good in the world you know she didn't even really do anything she was really old what you know i'm really sensitive about that vax i'm really sensitive about that vax and that was different that was pretty fucking deliberate what he did he was being puppeted by sorcerer michael jackson i turn into minxie and start walking i come out of minxie can i recognize the spell he's casting he's doing a cleric thing yeah seven son of a bitch always a problem 11 can i do a quick insight check on asum to see if i can still recognize if he's still affected by the mind-control thing ooh yeah 28 in fact i actually might be able to help seeker asum if you will allow me to uriel please-- just let me do a quick restoration spell on asum if nothing is wrong with him nothing will happen it's harmless it's like taking medicine when you're not sick it can't hurt and if i am wrong then we can continue on we can have vax tested please it'll take ten minutes what can it hurt he came to us first i meditate for a second and i cast enhance ability on myself can i get some meditation music scanlan am i maybe inspired by that self to enhance wisdom wisdom okay oh 29 no it worked yeah essentially yeah he gave me like a-- i don't know who to trust anymore to be totally honest it worked i could feel it break it worked and he's got some sort of long game i don't know if it's because he doesn't want uriel to know for whatever reason i don't know if it's because he has some deeper ulterior motive no wait no to vex what was your question i made sure i cauterized his wounds remember well we can split up i can go with you wait she's coming out of the palace we were just talking about you just accept it for what it is guys is there still the remaining wreckage of their carriage is that still there i have one right now oh i love farmers mr simms northwest can i do a nature check to see if i can recognize the creature he's describing 26 but it is a bird yes keep your money and can you please tell us how to get to your place do you normally stay there are you normally home we'll probably be by like tonight or tomorrow morning so we're in the middle of doing something we'll get to it it's funny how that type of thing can come back to bite you in the ass scanlan ignore him and what is wrong with you all today i follow i go to the edge of the door and knock percy it's keyleth okay we'll be here hi did you sleep do you need anything we went and saw uriel everyone in the city hates us they think we're all criminals okay yeah oh we'll see you later then i go ahead and i administer cure wounds can i do an insight check to see if he is also under a mind-control spell really do we not feel like terrible people enough already he's the son of a messenger that's even more ironic no i'm good continue son of a messenger only lady briarwood this could be an option to save whitestone and you would have your freedom would you like to stay in the guest room upstairs you'd be more comfortable you could get a good night's rest you're also the key to our own freedom so it's important no but it can make them allies if they have mutual enemies of their enemies it's a little complicated grog why don't you carry the bed down from upstairs would you like something to eat we'll have our staff bring down some food let me reference my spell tome it's not a common one it's situational but let me check real quick i haven't read that chapter from my book in a while what i was reading what how what did you do why are you touching me don't touch me right now what if you touch me one more time i am doing something else a request that was already made previously before can we fix drunk tiberius so i'm a little busy why don't you go sleep it off take a nap and i will deal with you in a second for you oh my god and i shove him into the cell and put him in bed-- oh i thought that you said-- everyone was like keyleth no i thought we were downstairs you don't fall off the roof i don't know what i do with him i let him pass out i let him go get a sandwich i don't know i got distracted okay wait my idea okay we were wanting extra fortification we were wanting extra protection okay i can't necessarily cast a big spell i could cast hallucinatory terrain we have a few options i'm giving them to you all i can cast hallucinatory terrain to make this look like something else i don't think-- i don't know i don't know if that's a good idea i don't know i could conjure a few woodland beings for like extra bears we could have some bears guarding the palace i could also throw up a wall of thorns to barrier the cell with the wall of thorns you're not here i went downstairs and i'm saying this to the group so i don't have to repeat myself the thing with wall of thorns is it's not super big it's 60 feet no it's 100 feet high it's really high actually i don't know how high it is don't quote me on that but it's not that long but we could fortify the doors more have bears we could do multiple things too on the briarwoods percy's behind huh all right i'll make some extra bears what gets rid of drunkenness (laughs) i don't want to burn a restoration spell on your drunkenness what time is it i make an army of bears wait no hang on what if i conjure a bear and then-- let me make sure while they figure their stuff out see we're all figuring stuff out okay i have a better idea why don't i conjure an elemental and then i can cast planar binding on him and he'll hang out for 24 hours i was figuring it out it's new figuring it out yes water elemental i know why do you do that i know and an awesome diamond has got to be more than 1000 so this time there's got to be at least 1000 grog what kind of jewel do you have a palm-sized ruby tiberius that's true to be fair the castle's being heavily watched by outsiders as well i could also talk to cows again maybe these cows will know something first can i ask her you said your neighbor boy kyle where does he live thank you i go to kyle yes no wait don't leave yet we need you that's irrelevant the point is i was wondering if you had any more information about the creature do you remember any other details any other defining details other than bird your kid is weird i'm into this plan but doesn't that essentially make us the bait well here's the thing maybe a few of us should not be cows because only a few people are going to have the ability to turn out of being a cow once they are a cow unless they take damage it's okay what vax said was way worse earlier another thing is i can turn into a cow i can turn someone else into a cow well polymorph is a concentration spell oh because you got that thing oh i'm a cow except for me who is going to be an actual cow we're all cows just embrace it scanlan would be like a calf big calf if we use seeming we just appear to be cows but we can still speak right would be like holy shit those are talking cows we are going to look like cows are we going to look like cows to each other too okay okay shall we go interview some cows which one looks like the alpha male tiberius just because you look like a cow doesn't mean you can talk to the cows the cows don't understand english no matter if you look like a cow they still don't understand common i cast speak with animals yes actually how many animals can i hit with speak with animals it is called animals right or is it just speak with animal oh just me the ability oh yeah i think you're right okay so i cast speak with animals on myself okay so i go up is there a cluster of nice-looking ladies sitting around hello ladies good evening i do apologize to awaken you i was just curious if you could tell me a little bit about some of the events that have been transpiring around here lately mainly the results of your kind getting killed have you seen a giant bird flying around anyone oh sure right where exactly where have they been-- okay damn cows it's never-- i'll get back to you in one second can you tell me anything about what it looks like does it seem to come at a certain time of the night they're cows i forgot that talking to cows never goes well didn't seem to know a lot they're simple-minded beasts yeah poor dork dork the ox i make myself look available i step away from the rest of the herd a little bit 100-foot wing span that hits no i'm normal 16 judging by the fairly close up appearance i have of him at this point can i tell it is probably a beast nature okay i'm going to attempt to cast dominate beast it has to make a wisdom saving throw that's my turn right can i try and break the grapple as a bonus action scanlan what the shit yay vox moo-china (booing) do i have a turn yet yeah i cast polymorph on it you're on it really out of thematic reasons i also turn him into a cow (laughter) my spell dc 18 i go eagle form as a bonus action i don't think that's how it works i can catch him if you need catched what does he add his spell attack bonus did it not drop the cow to 0 hit points yeah let's go for the element of surprise well technically we're all still cows all of us 21 yeah we did all of us 12 i don't want to kill a mama maybe we can transplant her capture her and move her away from town so there's a sheer peak and they're nested on the side of it i fly over as an eagle can we drop seeming i also approach and come out of my eagle form next to tiberius can i see vax is it higher than a 31 no i land beside tiberius and come out of eagle form tiberius would you please dispel this cow form from me please thank you are you a druid i'm also a druid i think our goals might be aligned it's okay what's her name i can relate to that because we were seeking justice for other people let's not let this escalate okay what is your name vyron byron i reach up to it and reach out to pet its beak okay 19 i kneel down a bit produce a few goodberries reach out it's okay it's all right that's a good girl i turn back to byron-- yeah and go that hurt now please listen to me please please listen to me we did come here to kill the giant creature but upon seeing the situation upon approach realized the situation and decided amongst all of us that we did not want to bring such a great creature to its death 20 total i'll take that 20 total under one condition just because one can appreciate nature does not mean that one cannot also appreciate humanity question if this is a young adolescent creature what do you think of the destruction it could cause once it reaches full adulthood are you okay with having that on your conscience this creature could result in the lives of many if you relocate out of town just a few miles say like 50 or 100 or so because this thing's really damn big so i'm sure it's got a pretty big-- you know what i mean i will help you i will personally come with you and tend to their safety and make sure that their location is proper and safe and handled with respect then you will be out of the harms of poachers you can live off the land and you can be free and alone listen-- yes that is correct listen we are being nice don't think that we will be the first you will have more people come and hunt you and kill this as this beast continues how long do you think you can survive waves of mercenaries coming to try and kill this we are the nice ones i suggest you heed our warning take our help and save the life of you and your creature in the long run there is an alternative tiberius can tell you of that alternative i was setting you up for an awesome one-liner man you were supposed to be like the other option is death yeah i don't know about that wait no hang on no this is getting out of control already i will not let you all do this no not today you guys have caused enough problems we are not going to push this creature on other people i'm trying all right i'm working on it i don't want to push this problem off on a town that's already being held hostage by vampires that fucking sucks that's double shitting on them that actually is fairly true please please listen to us we're only trying to help please believe me i let this thing almost take my hand off and i'm still standing here fairly cogently talking to you so please take that as a sign of honesty listen she's right we have friends in vasselheim we can contact the slayer's take we're a part of their guild we can tell them that you're coming they'll not bother you we can tell them they are not allowed to take out a contract on your creature you will not be harmed because they don't have mercenaries out there it has to be approved so it's really good i feel like i've done pretty damn good come on man how many fucking persuasion rolls does this asshole need please we really don't need another death on our conscience today before he leaves well wait we've got to go to the farm and i tell him if you're up that way there's a druidic tribe a little village called pyrah they're fire ashari you can find their headmaster cerkonos he's a friend you might find your people there who knows maybe friends will do you good yeah it was
