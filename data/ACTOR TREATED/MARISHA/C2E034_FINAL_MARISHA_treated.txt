a four and a three from that extra d4 so nine nein i'm now going to spend a ki point because i hit twice to do extract aspects i want to learn-- that's right we switched that oh it's just an ability i get to use now right so i hit twice i would like to know its constitution saving throw and if it has any damage not resistances but the opposite of that vulnerabilities okay i just shout it out and say i think if we freeze the thing it'll like freeze because water and then i'm going to spend another ki point and do flurry of blows pop pop with my fists first attack is a 22 sorry 23 no 22 i was right the first time the second one is not good it's a nine that is-- ooh ten damage yeah yep nein it's like that glass of water in jurassic park you're you in the opening title sequence right now

the balconies go all the way across sorry i'm not asking caleb or anything do you see any movement i ask caleb it's everywhere yeah yeah he has a bad feeling like something in your lower parts of your intestines what makes you think it's magical i'm pretty good at actually climbing this is through frumpkin 24 why would they have a patrol in a sewer system zsundie balcony seats though good view who says that zsundie maybe we can talk to him he seemed like a genie it feels like a genie circumstance right i don't want to fight this guy let's try and talk to him yeah we want to kill algar you said roll for initiative going to use my boots not too bad the water elemental that i rolled against had a plus three to its constitution maybe i can find out though if i hit twice in a row if there are any stats that are beneficial to any of your guys' abilities let me know if you want to know if you want to take the risk steve you're the best wait it's going ay wait no i thought it was fjord caduceus yasha what did you have caduceus okay you're right i'm sorry you're right i'm wrong which one is algar they all look the same when they're minis oh he is taller you're right oh it's on the genie guy but algar might have something i don't want to fight the genie guy i'm going to go for algar okay i'm going to see what i can do it was really awesome when the-- (cheering) is that it ay

i have any more movement (counting) 25 can i still try and go further one with my 45 feet of movement okay i've gone (counting) 20 arguably 25 to 30 can i just then try and get here copy with still disadvantage not as good that time gil 12 with ten more feet can i be like excuse me excuse me nott sorry oh so i can only get-- can i get behind her well then and i can't see algar fuck it this is what i worked for i'm going to go for it and try and do two shurikens right at his face three-quarters cover first one is a 14 plus seven so that's a big old 21 and then nine plus seven is a big old 16 yep mm-hmm a 21 and a 16 the first one-- mm-hmm nine damage yeah i go-- around the corner miss miss 20 feet zsundie zsundie with a j sentinel attack can i sentinel that bitch since i'm next to it and it's attacking someone who's not me i rolled a 14 to attack the water elemental not great six damage staff shit i should have just punched it did i just waste something what yeah that's so cool you did it it was so good that totally was that was great yes i threw a shuriken little dick big money where'd you get the rainbow dice ooh hans and franz what no block the door large fries motherfucker rue dies motherfucker right in the kidney i am going to steel myself for a minute look at the water elemental to my right and then cast step of the wind with a ki point and try and disengage like a rogue it does but it says you can spend one ki point to take the disengage or dash action as a bonus action so i would have to take an attack of opportunity if i decided to dash instead of disengage right i'm going to risk the hit and take the dash miss so my jump distance is also doubled for the turn can i be like parkour parkour and jump i'm going to try and jump up here is this disadvantage again or no i'm not rolling gil that's a natural one i move the rest of the way i can't jump now i can't use that double jump distance is that done step of the wind okay 22 (panting) fuck you guys and i'm going to take my shurikens and pop pop whoever i can see who the dwarf does it look like jester chopped off algar's hand (shouting) no sorry i'll go one for the dwarf one for algar pretty color for the dwarf balls so many balls all the way around we have nine for the dwarf and we have 12 for algar fuck i don't have any more bonus actions right or anything my worst nightmare you have the necklace from molly did you just talk matt out of it yeah that's cool 11 can't die twice in a row yes looney tunes style fuck you but i mean it's fine it's great yeah stay dead stay dead and are dying not dead dying is not dead though yeah yeah very yeah can a tentacle wield the lollipop yeah that's fun (gasps) but i thought he takes down two when he's dead ooh don't be a fucking creep it's very extreme it's very extreme so if you move into that sphere is it utter blackness matt and if i have dark vision goggles-- matt and does it help don't fuck with someone's mom could have made you more charming oh shit it's me okay i was going to say i look over at fjord across the parapet and i go ah what-- but how do i-- what do i do though then fuck i am going to-- i don't want to hurt him i want to move away from genie homie and then hold my action for-- yeah i want to move away from him and i'm going to hold my action until i can see preferably aldar but if not one of the dwarves algar not aldar al gore holding my action both of our clerics are grappled and restrained oh dex saves me and fjord dex save 15 what i rolled one less than him how many do i-- (yelling) catch me aw fuck you're going to aldar algar al gore i turn into the fetal position to cower and cover (singsong) live at seven pm he's after me come on come on nott i'm going to step of the wind again to get up (panting) double my jump run run run as much as i can more with my bonus dash and then move again (out of breath) i made it i'm here okay what do i-- okay i'm going to-- i go over to algar and i do the mma thing and i put my knee right to his face and i pin him down and i'm going to just full-on grapple him down and hold him for my action oh oh oh can i pull his bracelet off (meta-gaming pigeon coos) but it was in my head but it was in my head dammit it was-- i thought about it five minutes ago and i forgot-- that's good though that's good 19 that ends my go healing word
