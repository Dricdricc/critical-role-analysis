red dragon they call themselves the chroma conclave no you're-- you don't double them by city it's just one city-- no never mind just one dragon it should speak pretty loudly that we came to you first that's how much we trust you it seems familiar actually yup osysa if you are aware of this knowledge then you know that vasselheim is one of the only remaining cities still left standing are there any other services you can offer to help us fight this and where does your partner reside does he have a name we just had a third-party perspective he is south of the frostweald in the mountains i feel like we'll know if it's an ancient vestige of divergence zahra kash have either of you been near pyrah in the mountains east of here have any of you been where the fire ashari reside do we know how far away the frostweald is from here like where we started right in stillben that's not far from the air ashari correct aw she likes us yeah i have a couple that's right we get union discounts (nervous laughter) what as she places it down can i do a little gust cantrip and do a little poof of air fuck i know oh that's good though that's good i'm good i'm good hang on let me make sure make a sleight of hand--18 we're stacking the deck man we're stacking it if they all succeed it's going to be dope that's hot that's hot no we wouldn't be handing that shit over faberge eggs i druidcraft a little tulip and give it to her him debateable that's pretty good i didn't realize there was ten in there does this mean we're a terrible influence oh look at that look at that look at that we do have a mapmaker wasn't he here or was he in emon tyriok yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right we caught him in the tavern correct of vasselheim or of-- so there was a few regulars yeah yeah no no healing potions are generally a rip off i know it's true i did buy a book to learn alchemy and i just haven't had time to do it the alchemy book yes i'll go with scanlan and grog okay are you coming to the pub old stomping grounds grog yes he has character progression (laughter) how'd it go no never what hi what three two three it's blurry you should join us you all have to catch up come on life has been hard come on is zahra the only one that claps i have missed you guys i've never met you but i missed you guys look there's never not a good time to toast exactly i toast to celebrating the end of the world with the best friends we could possibly have all right percy come on there is something to fight for damn it sam taliesin and cheers to that because god knows we're not the finest well (laughs) i lost a fourth of my civilization oh that's right we still have work to do maybe if we hang here long enough kima will show up plus when i was a little girl we used to be taught that if you were ever lost in the forest to stay and hug a tree and someone will come and find you so if we stay in one place and this ale is like our tree okay we hug the ale and kima will show up that's my theory damn it i was hoping it was kima why are they acting like they fucked they're ex-lovers ooh grog i didn't know you swung that way toward-- never mind (yelling) another drink what mm it's been a long few weeks what what what what i literally never even had this experience in high school it's throwing me i don't know how to react to any of this oh right oh funny you mention that yeah you know-- i um you know okay i'm kind of new to all of this i don't really know what's going on thank you i'm new to that as well um-- okay yes (breathless) oh oh you think i'm dragging kash along oh no no no no no i mean he was just i only spent a day with him it was just a day i thought he was a lockpick this is literally the only thing vax is good at he really can't get out of the closet seriously though (quietly) i'm really confused kash okay five o'clock oh shit we need to get the rogue out of the closet but i miss kima (panting) guys this is hard to do with alcohol in your system i didn't know this was a farming industry uh-huh right those guys can i do a nature check 17 cool yes can you elaborate sorry dragon queen baator is that what he said baator ten but sir you should understand how close this destruction came from your doorstep but how do you know that will happen the next time is that always where you're going to place your bet how about four yeah kima we want that one i think her foolish impulses are exactly what vox machina's looking for you said these tomes might still be in vasselheim where and are all artifacts necessary to defeating these dragons osysa sir i come from the ashari people we are here to protect those boundaries that we set several thousand years ago do you think that some of this knowledge might still be within my people that's what he calls himself or do you think it's possible he is offering any one of those rewards so if this is the third age does that mean the fourth is upon us as do i we got it it's fine it's handled good question actually yeah and have you met kash kashaw i just pass vax my water canteen on the sly kima it's been very hard since we last saw you where are we going i also really need to check out the fire ashari we need to go by there regardless we need to stop by westruun that's on the way also on the way out the door it's not far from here there are trees i can also pop through a tree i can pop through a tree through most places pop through a tree and get us to westruun as long as we take a nap earthbreaker percy really wants an airship dear gods does he want an airship quickly efficiently i can luckily all places that we are going we've been to on our way there i pace next to kash so do you-- have you met kima i get the feeling that you guys knew each other you seem really put off by it i didn't know it was so-- yeah i feel that you don't need to apologize i also don't ever want to hurt anyone physically or emotionally okay my liege it's like sesame street (whispers) shit you might have to fight this motherfucker we're all hanging back just watching oh snap he's gonna kick your guys's asses i know i'm so confused that's cool that's some bruce lee shit (laughs) that's true that is all you heard what the fuck is this guy's base what oh shit this guy's a badass monks man that's the worst get the blood back in your head but that's what you said that's not what you said what happened like a chestburster like came out of him that's why we have grog around it doesn't matter they all suck (screaming) oh god yeah pretty sure keyleth runs over to vax and just hugs him super fast and gives him a peck on the mouth and says that was incredible that was incredible are you okay do you need healing i give him another hug and give him a cure wounds level three i heal you for 12 points i heal you 12 and then that's actually not bad dexterity save 20 total i hold his hair back a little bit his long black hair i just look at them and i'm like he got hit in the gut a few times we're like a mile high the oxygen's thin here it's tough all right we should go i saw someone on twitter say that this was like our cheers episode and i agree (laughter) and if you can't make it to portland our panel will be on on saturday on wizard world's twitch
