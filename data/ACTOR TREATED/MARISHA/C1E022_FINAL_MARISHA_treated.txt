no it does the energy feels better we have liam's daggers laura's gotten a bow do you guys want to get it i just run past him i run up to percy i've been drinking a lot of water i'm so glad you guys are alive that's cool do we get to choose where we get branded i'll be after tiberius it might've been me the law of vasselheim for not getting branded guys i'm thinking this might be a cult travis and i'm a little nervous she likes jokes can you hold it up again dinosphinx gynosphinx so question the little blue flashy thing that happens with the eyes is that going to happen with us now too yeah they told us oh my god we have so much to tell you guys that's what i said saying his name is very-- you know we went to a really high-end club and vax and i pretended to be married we actually had a cleric with us you just got mad at me for pretend-marrying your brother so i'm not interested-- no he was very nice oh really that should come from you yeah looking back it is you know what actually hang on stop do we have any ale on us we should have a drink real fast it's going to make it so much funnier it's going to make a gorgeous tapestry we-- the carpet we stole to be fair hey i'd never been kissed before okay what just happened god timing how have you been oh my god i think we've only been away for a week but it feels like a year how did you find us here how did you know to find us here pike well once again i don't want to leave because i'm assuming we'll lose access we don't have access to the airship for forever yeah it's around the corner did we want to go to a tavern too what time is it okay shop then tavern it's now just a very pretty rug i'm pretty sure it's a very expensive enchantment you have a ten percent chance of succeeding but it's awesome when it happens yes we take the carpet out i'm sure you're doing a lot with sarenrae no he kissed me oh his name was kashaw brother kashaw he was a cleric but he wasn't a cleric to sarenrae he was actually a cleric to this demon goddess named vesh it was interesting yes no apparently he's the only one he's also married to her i've thought about that a little bit and then tried not to think about that a lot it was awesome though then he just walked off into the sunset (whispers) i've never been kissed before so i don't know it was really good made me tingly inside yeah very nice he's not listening we're girl pow-wowing right now ashley and oh that's something else we have to tell you guys about i pull percy aside no remember this town they don't like magic and stuff and they get weird about potions and all the-- what are they called the bastions all control the trade of potions so people get weird it's weird and illegal what to the tavern hey you're thinking about it the wrong way grog it's the other way you want to go down not up i missed you all so much stay-cation he went to the park they're our sister tribe because we all separated essentially about 900 years ago or so roughly a thousand years ago we were a nomadic people and then there was some sort of great sundering-- we're actually still not 100% sure a lot of information was lost and the elemental planes started bleeding with this plane and oh vex is falling asleep anyway long story short we separated into four separate tribes to protect the places where the elemental planes bleed into this realm once every generation someone is nominated to go out and make contact with the sister tribes in order to establish further communication check in learn about each other's cultures we're from the same people but we each have our individual cultures because we've been separated for so long at this point these ones are fire yes so they're located in a volcanic region and you can start to feel an energy from where the planes start to shift and it gets a little unbalanced that's where we each live and i'm from the ones where we protect the air portals yes because where all the planes-- almost like a venn diagram if you want to think about it (stuttering) well he was a great philosopher of one of our peoples but he described it as being these overlapping circles what's that he was very great man we don't necessarily overlap with the fey we protect where it overlaps you could get to the fire elemental plane easier from this place and my town you can get to the plane of air-- that's a good one grog are you feeling okay vex but anyway the last person to go on the aramente was my mother and she never returned so we haven't really had contact with the fire ashari for a while i have no idea what they're going to be like i've gotten rough directions we'll have to probably figure it out along the way it also seems like this is one of those towns where things are expensive things are expensive here i am so nervous you guys i'm so scared we'll go in the morning one more i'm so scared i'm so nervous i whip her up a little herbal tonic here drink this no don't pay full price for a sick dragon what is that he looks a little-- oh can i check him out is he considered an animal can i check him out aw lockheed peach can i do a check on him and see if i make him feel better medicine check oh that's not bad 19 total i reach in my pouch and pull out a few goodberries i can but he's not an animal he's a dragon-guy just feed him lots of water-- i gave him some goodberries i'll make up some more goodberries i mean i don't want to inconvenience anyone i have to do a trial and meet their headmaster yeah it's not even that it's sometimes learning about your past can be equally as terrifying i don't know what i'm going to find well from what i heard we head south towards sunder peak towards the southwest it's volcanic territory maybe i only got vague directions do you actually have a map that we could use borrow hydra you wouldn't happen to have a compass would you tyriok awesome wait you drove the horse into the ground a warhorse for grog (high-pitched) okay i mean we're all right right we're on a path how far did we make it i'll do my anti-life shell for the first hour that way we all get an hour of good sleep i pull out my little book of druid spells and history and i start freshening up on some fire spells oh and actually you know what before we go to sleep or actually first thing in the morning before i learn my new spells-- i'm also going to go ahead and be like hey guys i made breakfast and make a heroes' feast at night because i had it learned 24 hours yeah because i'm learning new spells in the morning i thought of you (choking noises) grog so at the top of the morning as part of the heroes' feast everyone gets 2d12-- and you heal that as well and you also fill up that as well also everyone now has advantage on their wisdom saving throws for 24 hours it's good to have a good night's sleep though (worried sounds) i'm just-- it's just a lot of pressure it's good well just approach like one would approach can i do a nature check see how long it's going to hang out ooh 17 that's 27 i drop to my knees and i do commune with nature it's big 5th-level spell looks like that's the way that's what i did with the earth ashari but i mean they were welcoming and kind we haven't made contact with them in almost two generations i don't know last time we made contact with them it was fine and everyone was good but who knows it's been a while because my mother didn't come back how we came to be-- for all we know once again roughly a thousand years ago-- certain people possessed natural abilities we assumed we were blessed by the gods of nature and when we realized we had these abilities and then the sundering happened that's when we banded together but it could have been anyone between humans elves there were a few dwarfs gnomes mainly humans and elves so we're primarily-- i guess you could say mutts primarily half-elven but we separated off into our own separate tribes so we each developed our own individual cultures even though we came from the same root but we're accepting of all races at least the air and the earth ashari are yes absolutely and each tribe has its own tradition it's had a lot of time to develop it touched my ass it hit me in the ass sure i don't know what to expect i'm good i'll wait see what i'm most nervous about is when i went to the earth tribe they said that my mother had passed through and went through her training and her ulare trip and she was fine and then continued on okay okay and please don't mention anything about us being called the shits when we first got started nervous 14 14 all right our tribe we generally can still make contact and trade with nearby towns generally there might be more travelled ones once again i'm not sure yeah let's try the path more travelled first druid dice not good nine how do we know if we failed who has the coughs how do we know did i fail with a nine oh my god 14 i'm going to do a perception check and see if i can see any sign of a village or a town or my people 23 knowing my people and my tribe would i know if these were centurions let's continue on this would sometimes happen at the air ashari as well we'd get windstorms occasionally it happens do i have enough time to react 23 60 marisha matt and how far away are they roughly do you guys want to run yeah we're in a death pit man i turn around where they are right in front and throw up a big wall of stone don't take out my wall of stone running (laughs) rabble rabble three miles ooh 28 twinsies twinsies rolls can i do a nature check to see if it's natural from earthquakes or if earthbenders have done it 25 and most of it appears to be obsidian can i see through it where they chipped away please i am keyleth of the air ashari and i am here to further my aramente and i look around and i'm like-- persuasion persuasion's not good ten my father korren and my mother vilya my mother was my predecessor wait no that's-- right yes predecessor she followed in my path i'm following in her path damn it god i'm so bad at being eloquent and what might i ask is your name let me do all the talking this time oh you don't-- yes family my brothers and sisters just let them do it i'm king of vilya oh kin of vilya yes i am i am here to complete my aramente i have already been to the earth tribe my mother vilya never returned to zephra matt for you to be here on your aramente it is proof that she did not complete hers or at least is no longer with us i am sorry she was strong of heart only ten years ago she's been gone for close to 20 yes how long was she here she was better than i am he is as stubborn as always yes these are my traveling companions vox machina they've proven themselves time and time again we've been together for almost over a year now i do we actually have a keep now in emon correct i have actually seen a vision of my death from not having the will to do what is necessary for fear of harming others instead of protecting myself part of one of the ceremonies that the earth tribe gives is called the alore ceremony it's a tea that they make that is derived from a local plant that-- it's essentially a vision quest tea it gives you visions it's a cultural tradition i guess i saw two paths one was an older woman who was wise and hardened and brave and she had a line of young ashari behind her and i ran away i feel like she was me and i ran away and i went down another path there was a tree it was young but strong and it had a familiarity as i reached out and touched it my vision was taken through the path of the roots and i could see the world and i could see how everything was connected and it took me to you all and you were strong and fighting and proud and then vax yelled out this one is for keyleth i wasn't with you and then grog yelled out this is for our princess and it broke away and i realized that i was that tree and it was my death and as i ran to the other side i went back to the old woman and all of my people slowly started fading behind her and as she looked at me she said your future is as important as it is fragile protect it and she too faded away i realized she was me and when i came out of my vision i talked with the earth headmaster patisse and she told me that if i was going to survive i needed to have the will to do what was necessary and the strength and ever since the child it's been hard i was there for a long time at the earth tribe longer than most stay on their aramente i couldn't get through the trial every time i used a natural magic every time i tried to fight i just saw flashes of that child's eyes i was blocked normally they save the alore ceremony for the final testament but they actually started me with the alore ceremony in order to help hopefully unlock my spiritual blocking that i was having but i don't know continue on and hope i don't make a fatal mistake hope that i can learn i hope i don't let you guys down i love you all i do as he says 27 i push it out and continue to focus 19 i push it out and continue to focus just focus and meditate on asking permission oh my god i rolled the same thing twice wisdom five 18 before i leap down i cast protection from flame on myself or protection from energy and i'm going to use fire gives me fire resistance i close my eyes and let myself fall oh my god that's true you have advantage on all of our wisdom saving throws from the heroes' feast oh my god we're in the plane of fire okay okay sure yeah he might mean more metaphorically i'm not sure it could be either it's hard to tell can i sit and take a minute to meditate and see if i can connect with my mother and see if i can find some sort of trace essence i have advantage right i'll take that 15 thank you it was a one so that's 28 any direction of which way the essence might be blowing it's a fire elemental 16 let's head that way let's follow this lava trail looks promising do you have pass without a trace right now 25 do i get anything for having my protection from fire that looks like a stone spire to me it's rather shiny yeah let's go there oh jesus ballsacks all right (giggling) yes god damn it wheaton here got to get my dice in order five five he rolled a one too we're like oh cool it's fire taliesin and 23 no 24 i take half right hot diggity i did teach him that miss 17 (whoosh) oh my god (laughs) stop drop and roll fire safety kids i look at cerkonos and give him a nod and i say okay and i concentrate and my entire form goes water and i turn into a water elemental and then i immediately rush into cerkonos's space and do whelm so he has to do a dc 15 saving throw strength sweat it out guys so he does 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage i'm also water elemental so i believe he has water susceptibility correct i don't know what that does but he's got it so if it's a large or smaller creature it is also grappled 2d8 not bad 12 plus four 16 does he take extra damage because i'm water because he has water susceptibility it's water versus fire elemental right now well i just football tackle him (impact) water right through his form steam rolls off of me (hiss) i take how much four damage hits don't worry about hurting me if that's what you're afraid of 17 disadvantage four did it break all right i'm going to do a multiattack right on cerkonos so i'm going to do two (impacts) with my big wavy arms so plus seven to hit so first one 18 so that's 20 okay and second one that's not as good 19 sorry 18 okay cool so that's 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage twice so that's five six so that's ten nine plus another 13 23 points of damage oh plus an extra two because i'm a water elemental yeah i'm on his ass yeah 14 17 18 plus six so it's 24 plus another eight so that's 32 was that a 20 i slowly release him down from my water elemental form i drop my-- no i'm going to keep in my water elemental form 30 okay i lied i drop my elemental form i go ahead and i'm going to cast gust of wind ahead of us to try and make a tunnel and try and air this heat down what are rolling that's not too bad 22 aw we were the happy table (laughter) no don't do it pike i was going to say can i use my wanderer ability where i think i get-- my survival ability i think i get advantage please that's much better okay 14 no don't-- sorry i rolled a 14 24 we're almost there hold on 13 19 thank you cerkonos brother thank you this is a great honor i think a rest might be in order i'm exhausted oh to make s'mores that's a great idea do you have water cerkonos i bow to him and i salute and i say kaitiake brother thank you it is sort of our salute it means guardian and brethren it's a high salute kaitiake well my last stop would be to the water ashari in aquas back on another continent no i don't think we could i'm doing pretty good actually i'm ahead of schedule we have a good feeling about it do i know what it does can i do like a check on it i'll keep it safe could be cool for grog boxing oh claws you said claws
