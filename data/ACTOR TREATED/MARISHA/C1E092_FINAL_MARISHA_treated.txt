good box does it turn into a raptor is it scratch and sniff tell us about loot crate sam sam when did you get here it was crazy it is going to be aired during talks machina this week in place of our normal show so if you miss it you get to see the full panel in its entirety (accent) talking comics (accent) talking comics we released a ringtone (laughs) as well as-- so you can now get our theme song as your ringtone on itunes we also released a free screensaver that you can download based off of the old flying toasters after dark yeah flying toasters the winamp skin was cancelled but we're working on it but yeah we-- just because we thought it was funny that's how we choose to spend our free time is releasing free screensavers yeah so go do that (laughs) he brings us in chunks that was phenomenally worded (laughs) very murderous very shark-chummy i'll have a panic attack is what (clears throat) i want to do all right fuck me okay ugh don't fuck this up don't fuck this up i am going to continue with my original plan can't-- getting cotton mouth and (laughs) and i'm going to slowly start from the top down transforming-- forming-- shut up sam no i want to use shapechange yes right because i can't alter self into an erinyes right so i'm doing it now an erinyes it's that thing that we fought in the city of brass there was like the devil that we fought-- yeah the one that you squared up against with for most of the time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (deeper voice) you know i never did catch your name what do they call the two of you you got dis oh i'll take that 18 and i think my intimidation's an eight-- no it's a seven so-- 25 yeah are you sure because i would love to know maybe add you to the collection oh what's the matter where're you going and then i turn around and i (strained) just start walking cool-- (whimpers) yeah i can fly that's also this is a concentration spell so i can't do-- okay so i'm going to as i-- is anyone looking around anyone looking around right now god damn it 22 i look at it and i just nod and then i start heading back towards the tavern before i round the corner i want to just take and do a quick shapechange again into the tiefling that i was into the tavern go upstairs to the rest of the group (panicked gasping) okay okay i didn't make it far i didn't make it far woo i made it around the corner and the two devils that seemed to be very interested in you vax cornered me-- (nervous laugh) huh i have a feeling it has something to do with your deity i think they can tell that vax is special i think-- he has value down here they said they were interested in 'the white one' and i couldn't help but notice that you were turning quite a few heads when we were walking through town i don't think it has anything to do with the way you looked i don't think it matters what he turns into i think people will be able to tell the aura that he carries with him well i can do this for about another 55 minutes before we'd have to sleep before i can do it again i was going to go see if i could get a bead on where hotis is oh what guys check this out this is what i freaked 'em out with and i go back into the erinyes form (deeper voice) check it out check it out that's pretty hot right it makes my-- -- it makes my voice a little smokey when i'm down here too right i know i'm an erinyes it's with an 'e' erin like erin-yes yeah yes well changing into this thing meant that i had to drop concentration on my locate creature spell i can only concentrate on one thing at a time it gets-- especially this it's a lot to mentally focus on i noticed-- just let it go percy i noticed we're being watched i think at every turn there was a little imp guy watching me when i came in oh shit that's right your dad a long time ago wait did you really well get that-- get that-- can i-- get that out get that out yeah percy-- your-- (laughs) (laughter) did you really holy shit let me let me see if i can get something out of it can i scry on it like scry and see if it shows me something is that-- a thing i-- no individual i don't have that oh i know okay you know this imp that i saw did have sparkly gold armor he may be like an important imp i'm just saying i feel like everyone's here wanting to make a deal it might be good to talk to others i feel like we don't need to make a deal to go murder someone to get arrested i feel like i could just go streaking in the street and just say words and we would get arrested why do we need to commit this crime and then suffer the apt consequences can he get us out out never came up then why do we need him as our in yes i did yes i did i could do-- attempt something similar potentially with a higher-level version of my locate creature spell-- -- which is find the path which could get us close potentially it's a lawful evil dimension if he wants his boss dead that means that there's going to be someone else above him if we kill one guy who's all going to want to kill us he's literally still holding it in his hand in front of your face you just-- ooh look at you oh my gosh wow well we just-- it's like curfew we have to be home in about 50 minutes the what the prison i didn't see how big it seemed immense and like it was probably pretty big underground but i couldn't-- can't be for sure it won't get us out of here no oh you know we have a day or so does anyone else think that we should maybe not take the first deal that presents itself in the first tavern that we step into in the city does that not seem super convenient i mean-- (transforming sound) (deeper voice) we've got about 50 minutes if we still want to go what i think an extra day of walking around this city could potentially save us years in hell that-- we don't take the deal he said he wants the day do you have to make a point in the room we're sleeping in no we can show him later do you want me to be poppa-- (stammering gibberish) (laughter) it's been a long week do you want me to be the erinyes all right do my thing no sure i got 30 minutes left of this 9th-level spell i look like-- i currently look like that that's true i can do it all he's right i'll just take my regular tiefling form for now correct for 30 minutes aw fuck it's long it's like the cpa mini-game of vox machina it's so fucking long it's got to be at-- there's like-- i feel like we should give this to grog (laughs) it's definitely like an iphone contract at what cost at what cost my favorite line this contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of eternity that's my favorite wow-- and you just have to like say that you're like 'yo ipkesh i take that second pact' mm i mean-- i already got close the bastion of death is-- the bastion of flesh is who he wants us to kill correct i could also do find the path if i have a little piece of the prison if we could get a little piece of the prison-- what hey there are people who walk away with pieces of forests beaches all the time i don't know does there look like an oddities store (laughs) yeah he did have a cloak but-- i mean last time we saw him he was also a-- little writhing-- i don't know if he would still have those items does there look like there's a weird oddities store or dealer or-- natural 20 hee hee hee-- that's bad you just got punished for being too witty it's so sad oh no i feel like we have to call you yrat now i'm never going to-- wode and wade what the shit wode and wade yrat-- and you can call me minxie greg well imagine this is happening quickly right thing is-- i'm looking for something specific do you have any pieces or remnants or items from the mentiri prison specifically from the bastion of flesh why not where is it located we need in and then i slowly start to shapechange just for the erinyes face and i give just a flash of it we need in and you're going to help me aren't you fucking hell fucking hell it's a 19 but it was almost bad plus seven so 26 well then how do people get around the city you know where do i find them and i show them the ring of asmodeus he has it (high-pitched singing) it can only be jared i need a name and location of where to find the information that i need then who does god damn it-- the chain devils all right yes i had one of those for breakfast i snatch it from him yrat do the thing well it's to relay information back to whoever's wearing it or to him specifically we'll take it for good measure i guess i just want this as a souvenir for our visit i'm not going to pay for it you're not going to sell this i want it right i lean forward and i take my erinyes nail and i go around his face and i say consider this a good-faith investment you will be seeing us again and i take out 20 gold 20 gold if you minions would like to buy the purple stone with your allowance-- -- the mistress grants you you may you're welcome young wade very keep it that way all right roll out (laughter) it was taking everything to not say autobots and i kind of want to-- i use alter self to go to my tiefling form as we start-- are we walking back towards the tavern as we walk i-- so it seems one of the lesser devils who is interested in vax might be our ticket in the chain guys yeah i guess i could i'm wondering if worst-case scenario we could always use you as bait vax sorry wode party on wode we get back okay we gotta get back to the tavern back to the tavern well to be fair i feel like these people are used to being watched 20 i hate it when that happens it's like a flashbulb going off in your eye ugh bastards oh christ i can't that's it that's all i got for the day that's it i got 4th-level spells and lower it's the little things that was-- very specific no but i feel like you have don't worry about it what percy-- such a hero is it only because you've experienced these types of temptations before no we'd just have to release a couple of devils into the material plane yes i agree percy if you die though doesn't this mean that you forfeit your soul here-- you're fine that was my question yes but we came here willingly-- yes percy we've come here to try and kill a kitten and it's already been a massive pain in our ass we really don't want to come back to try and save your soul talk about-- talk about the revisions first always get those revisions first and a new print-up that we need on a t-shirt that would be nice oh again jesus fuck-- ask about the bastion of flesh-- ask about the bastion of flesh well how big is this prison-- not the full name (laughs) musel who what oh shit yes ooh tiger maple it's a dice tower where you make the magnets happen go take that survey easter weekend i'm going camping yeah yeah it's going to be so good stealth in kill a pit fiend done it before we can do it again okay i'm confident about this plan how did we do it last time and bumblefucked our way out of it i can do-- nope nope i can't sick eat your cheerios bud what the sheets doty i got a 17 and an 18 that's pretty damn good 32 don't we still have some rations that we have been carrying around with us for quite some time i could animal shapes us there yeah all of us eighth level but it could be worth it to not be seen and get the drop i imagine we'd get there do animal shapes to get through and get to him yeah bugness everdeen thank you laura liked it later not now let me figure that out who's got a player's handbook in the house animal shapes what are you looking at large or smaller beast so i can't do anything-- -- microscopic not microscopic but tiny i can't be tiny bird-size i'm alter selfing into my tiefling form

other side of the wall utugash because i was trying to be-- i was trying to be stealthy shift of stones what do you guys want to flank i think we can flank looks like there's an entrance on either side he's in this room can i take this opportunity to do a quick inspiring leader speech then no i'm not going to do that i'm going to flank around this side a bit other side there might be a door over there right two doors is there a door on that side yeah if we can flank him that'd be great yeah i follow i follow tary as well are we splitting up anyone going through the door can maybe tary gives us one entrance and then we use the actual entrance as well-- -- so we're all not going into one entrance flank a motherfucker this could be door number two over here that way we're all not crowding through one door do you have advantage on that because of my thing okay (laughs) still cool are you available next week we could've found you in a magical shop we could've found you in a prison i think i called him u-tu-gash because that's what i wrote down like uta hagen but utugash oh it is u-t-u utugash okay big room
