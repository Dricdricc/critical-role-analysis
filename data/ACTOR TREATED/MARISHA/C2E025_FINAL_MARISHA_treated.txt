also going on every day feels like a year the boxes are looking so cool i probably shouldn't spoil that but it's pretty cool i'm so emotional where are we now are we still in the butcher is rissa still there rissa sorry okay we were talking about planning and then sleeping and then going i really would hate for our problem with them to end up coming and finding the kids my words aren't really here right now you know what i mean emotionally i say we send rissa to go talk to them that's true maybe we go back to their employer yeah let's hold on to it maybe there's going to be some sort of emergency situation use node in case of emergency this is revenge for any time we haven't let matt go on an npc just saying wait are fjord and jester going to go call off the employers i would just hate for them to find the kids and then do something to the kids i mean we put caleb's alarm across it but still exactly i don't know can you do it to the kids yeah taliesin and man that solves that problem we don't need help we saw bolt-throwers those giant bolt-throwers like lord of the rings-style siege towers also lord of the rings-style battering ram like every fantasy movie-style but definitely lord of the rings and the huge cannons pirates that's what we saw last-- or that's what i think i saw when we did a perception check or something uh-huh firemark what blades oh god do the blades spin oh my god so where's the source so if we get the source-- yeah doesn't sound like a city i'd want to live in (sighs) can we go get suits awesome black suits yeah yeah something with a big lapel maybe double breasted sounds great we would look so handsome you guys oh would your dad does your dad like pastries does he have a sweet tooth does he like pies let's pick up your dad a pie on the way home people like pies right meat pies would your dad like a meat pie i just hear people bring pies thank you beau but that's okay it's been a long emotional day hasn't it fjord oh man so much it's been the longest day we stop and get a meat pie on the way one for us one for him two meat pie-- sorry three meat pies can we make that a double thank you i throw down for the pies mm that was super smart though i pass out meat pies to anyone who wants one but save one taxman are they heading towards the butcher it was rissa's idea i love that that's what we're calling it spinning death machine no she just has hearing yeah oh no-sies it's a duracell okay these lenses i'm assuming they're regular lenses i don't know they can still be blinded right so it's super cheap and easy to break imported great i was going to say if we can get something to blind it it's still just a lens why not something darker like ash charcoal black powder that is darker actually this brings up a-- how much molasses do you have that's so weird it’s so abrasive sometimes i feel like molasses would gum up something that's clockwork right yeah something sticky i mean how do we transport it heated tar in a bucket yeah it gets hard it's tar once we get down once we get down he totally just took a thank you for not his baby being born i feel like at break time last time it came off you made it to break i think don't do this to yourself when was the last time you left your house cleff agoraphobic just us huddle around him okay we perform a protective-- no not that close we're making a safety bubble ah i can't nominate fjord do you believe in me fjord all right tar first is that far from here i take my staff out and i go (vibrating ring) across the gate good money or trade for some supplies i thought we're behind a gate like locked out just sneak in and they’re mainly gnomes working this-- okay so i like as a plan b you disguising yourself as a gnome worker do it first i'll keep watch i'm keeping watch for any workers who might be noticing the bucket bravo bravo nott how close does mage hand have to be it was pretty good to the prison will it tip over in the bag we are a contracted group of workers working for this man right here cleff we're here to take care of the problem that we heard you guys had with the clockwork warden i stole this die that i got you from forever ago it's got the little d20 inside of it i'll take the 12 for 13 what did you say the warden's name was wardenhelm poppin-- drokrusher first off-- you don't have to-- okay yeah same rissa same we will not take up much of your time if you just let us in to go kill this clockwork warden that this guy made we heard he was quite a problem just let us in we'll be out of your hair and you can get back to your work remember this guy why do people keep calling us that look this guy is funding to take care of the spinning death machine that's in your guys' basement this should be a city-funded issue but this guy is being a good noble citizen and funding it himself so we can come and make a quick buck and kill your death robot can we please just go kill your damn death robot you look like a man who's willing to climb a ladder war is a great time for opportunity my friend (laughs) high-fivesies from across the table who would who's going to be throwing the tar you with your mage hand maybe yasha and i can try and pin it down maybe corner it start ripping the plates off let's get to the door heat it up-- any last tips cleff that's a good one hamster ball i don't know to be fair i think we were going to rest and we decided against it we decided to go we know she used two-- fjord's literally the only one that can charm a guard unless we bribe a guard do some suggestion stuff is this the door how big is this chamber in here splits in the middle two more sets of cells on the back side so it looks like a big fork does it have a common way or is this thing patrolling halls should we heat up the tar so he can cast two spells they have to be at third level and his cantrips are-- so if he casts armor of agathys it's going to take up one of his levels and hex would be another one this place is creepy as shit fjord's going to cast armor of agathys on himself hope that is a good call what would fjord do and beau puts on her goggles (like fjord) eldritch blast dear spinning death machine thanks rissa (whispering) i'm going to assume yes hey jester (cooing) (cooing) okay maybe pass without a trace jester (cooing) maybe not okay nevermind keep going caleb maybe save your shit for afterwards normally you don't want to get trapped in a room with something bigger and spinning with 12 blades i think we'd be better off holding this choke point i'm going to move up and go to the opposite side of where molly is and peek down the opposite way just like he did you know i like that idea maybe yasha and i can stand and hide and crouch in the corners while you guys get its attention and shoot it from range what i would be afraid of is if we were all in there and it eventually did what it did to those bars over there and busted in and we were all sitting ducks on the inside it looks like it-- can i still complete my perception check and see if i see down here not great seven is there anything that would warrant a couple people hiding while some people got in the thing is there something that looks like yasha and i could maybe hide i'm a little disadvantage looking at this angle you could still mage hand the tar between the bars right let's try it that's what i'm saying caleb can you lift that gate spell if we need to get back out wait are you and yasha going to be on the outside neither do i yeah let's do it but we're going to hide amongst this rubble on the opposite side and you guys are going to start yeah can i get up on top of the rubble and crouch down what do you need a lot of gold dust i know can we grind some gold really fast file some quietly file down gold coins scout with the cat kitty scout i'm going to stealthily move forward back where i was across from molly jesus christ this just got really-- 15 oh no where is fjord going make fjord go by the gate maybe back a bit then beau is going to take out those ball bearings let's not kill our friends’ d&d characters if we still have a bit of an action i'm going to toss my bag of ball bearings and try and throw a bunch of ball bearings right here oh wait not with advantage or no okay 18 then molly ball bearings didn't work rolling for initiative i'm rolling for fjord hang on sorry another person's character fjord is 14 beau is ten fjord’s going to cast hex i’m going to hex that robit hang on wait that doesn’t-- no it doesn’t mess with armor of agathys just checking this is hex then he’s going to take his falchion he’s going to flip it and from the hilt he’s going to go (firing) he’s going to cast eldritch blast because i saw him do that once before he did it before i’m ripping it off from travis pew pew 15 seven plus eight right that magic shit he’s going to try it one more time that bounced okay that’s better 13 plus seven i’m sorry me don’t know how six sorry five plus four is nine damage no that’s it i rolled a three and a two plus a four it’s not a lot of damage i rolled crappy what did you roll to hit what did you roll to hit 21 so we know 20 hits now beauregard-- yes because i’m scared beau is going to-- i’m sorry i didn’t know 18 is what hits y’all that’s not too bad 22 okay 12 okay being hit with hot shrapnel i’m going to do a cool pole vault over nott i guess wait where’s yasha yasha’s here i’ll get on the other side of where yasha will eventually be uh-huh on this side of it yep then attack whack it with my stick i’m going to try and jam it up in between one of those gears that’s terrible that doesn’t hit that’s like ten i’m going to readjust and try and go for it again that’s the exact same roll those are two twos in a row two twos i guess i will do an unarmed attack so frustrated that i can’t get my staff up there i’m just going to go and try and whack it with my fist 17 which just misses do i have any more movement can i back up towards or even get this-- i’m just going to stay where i am oh wait hang on as a bonus act-- no i used my bonus action fuck okay keep going yeah we can hear you now oh wait do it again it's a pretty tight box we're in (singing) playing with your friends' d&d characters we can't see the sphincter oh yeah sure that's right (singing) because we're flanking bitch (exaggerated texan drawl) i do a cowboy saunter up behind the-- i go under the lollipop and i use the magical field of the lollipop to make it like me walking through a glitter fog machine i walk up to him thank you i walk up and i'm going to attack with my falchion i'm sorry travis i'll take that 18 plus that seven plus hex and then i'm going do booming blade with my action is that not how this works okay no i'm going to do damage never mind then i'm just going to hit it real hard six plus two plus five so eight plus five see my math i can only do half i'm so tired okay it's still advantage right yeah hyuck hyuck hyuck i'll take that 16 yeah somewhere he's getting a nosebleed while this happens four plus four plus five so 13 do i have any more movement like ten more he's going to back up to that gate a little bit two if he can he's still in melee okay yep that's fjord's turn cleff you sick bastard he did yeah he said he didn't have a failsafe that lying old bastard shit i was really wanting advantage on all my attacks oh but i have yasha flanking okay six apply changes (singing) d&d beyond okay i'm having internet problems view okay i get advantage on this attack right okay i'm going to try and once again get up in those plates that one's cocked underneath okay no it was cocked underneath it was tilted then i won't use it okay 17 plus seven i rolled both at the same-- no first to strike okay okay it's still an 18 okay four plus another four because it's not magical even though i still hit can i try to stun it with a stunning strike i haven't hit anything in so long and i just want to stun something i've had such bad luck the past two fights i haven't been such a good monk okay yeah yeah it saves i'm going to do that still have advantage right man it will be really awesome when that monk ability that's core of my class actually works 17 plus seven six plus another four so ten total sorry since i have two hits can i do extract aspects spend a ki point i get to learn two things now can i learn its lowest saving throw ability hey molly you want to mock this asshole to death okay i'm going to take my last attack still at advantage right okay i hit with a 15 plus seven so a 22 i have a d6 now five damage i'm feeling so useful you guys yeah i'm going to stay exactly where i am are you using my friend's success to try and make me feel better oh you're trying to use my friend's failure to make me feel better it's impossible to take you seriously and jester is with you no don't do that go back sorry keep going i think that's the best thing i've done this whole fight is flanking okay fjord is going to walk up i'm a warlock first he's going to do-- i don't think this is a concentration thing it's a bonus action he's going to do hexblade's curse i gain a bonus to damage rolls that equals my proficiency modifier an additional three damage i should have done this forever ago i'm not a warlock first attack still with advantage right oh he's not it's just yasha and i plus seven oh wait sorry but i'll take it those first two attacks 17 and 14 d8 plus six six plus seven so 13 on the first one same 13 on the second one yeah can he back up again ten if he does an attack of opportunity if i move fjord back than we get a sentinel strike right yeah let's do it sorry fjord he hasn't taken any damage step back he still has armor of agathys too i think that's as far as he can go movement speed-wise sure what okay yes it does i do do i still get advantage because flank okay yeah that's a 17 plus seven so 24 that's an eight on an eight plus four so 12 damage and he does not move ah caleb oh god how long has he been like that 14 don't fuck fjord gil oh good 17 for fjord do i save 14 i had 27 hit points left beau’s unconscious again roll a death saving throw that is the thing i do do i roll again can i take the roll i just used 14 should have brought more tar you really get tired of this dying thing i guess unconscious thing dope i get 12 yeah beau is going to deliriously-- still really messed up like a drunk person doing a pointless task-- is going to try and scoop up some ball bearings that she threw and then after maybe she picks up like ten-- okay 12 i tossed my baggie-- my pouch and did one of these things so i'm going to get my pouch back and then-- okay then after i deliriously tired of scooping up ball bearings i'm going to stumble back and collapse next to caleb and also take a short rest ooh (slurring) i don't know it might be yours it's hard to tell (slurring) that's very true i'm going to remember that next time (slurring) you're the best fjord your mustache is traveling no he's my pillow fuck you molly (groaning) okay beauregard goes i just-- it took a lot out of us i pass out in yasha's arms yasha you have to carry me i rolled way better you make me feel so warm inside how many hit points we're the mighty nein i don't know how long we might be staying in town so maybe we should go ahead and talk about that deal while we're here to get out the schusters oh but you talked about getting people out take that 200 gold consider it their bail and time served and this guy will agree to that right cleff i elbow cleff total well considering you have a hunk of metal down in your basement that is worth at least 100 gold worth of scrap that i'm sure the assembly yard would love to have-- fjord can foot half since he's sympathetic he's like no money was spent kids are expensive gilda wallace why don't we get outside and then we'll talk let's just say your kids made an impression on us i was going to say eclectic but sure it's like being in vegas for more than 24 hours you're like no not again i can't do this for a third night in a row ugh oh your way was way more cool (whistling) (knocking) this is making me really emotional kiri (exhales) a favor in return-- no you were nailing it we did a jinxies thing yeah fjord's right no child should be separated from their parents unfortunately this little one was you've learned shit i turn to gilda and wallace and say look i know another mouth to feed is a lot it would mean a lot if you take her but we'll help you out i reach in and i give them 50 gold from my stash should be enough to help for a little bit hopefully make up the difference well i stole 75 gold from my friend without him being here to speak for it so i feel like it's fair go give jester a hug i know she wished she'd be here for it i give jester a hug you already are look at this handsome lot you look like you need to be a vinyl decal on the back of a minivan that might be the first nice thing i've ever done i don't know what this emotion thing is it's weird it probably isn't on the way i look for someone who wasn't the guy who hated us before selling more of those poppers because i want to stock up before we get out of this godforsaken town another set of ten yeah yeah caleb oh yeah yeah it wasn't too bad honestly i don't really have a lot of plans my entire life has been plans being made for me so it's nice not having plans i ran away from the cobalt soul i have ideas i don't know if ideas would count as plans i'd be willing to help you under one condition can we agree to keep each other straight if either one of us tries to turn and do something stupid or lean a little bit more evil chaotic whatever you want to call it anarchists let's just make a pact if either one of us do anything stupid that maybe we're each other's failsafes i don't think i want to hurt any more people and i don't think you do either so maybe if we keep each other from hurting other people that's not true i do want to hurt people just not people i like let's hurt bad guys skype high-five matt and can you do the-- give me a-- don't know if a lesson was learned here but all right let's continue on cleff maybe if in the future we come back and need a repair or something spiffy you'll cut us a deal and hey i don't know if you know the schusters at all but if you see a family walking around little bird child maybe watch over them for us i acknowledge that and thank you fuck you molly what time is it yeah to shitty creek yes if you're deserted on an island to kill yourself with my heart they were in a silence spell better be some dope investigating at the top when we come back blood splatter some csi shit up in here yeah we’ll have dope one-liners the who it’s going to be great we didn’t kill fjord and jester though by puppeting them we took some money but that’s a good cost for not killing them that 75 gold so we have the haversack and if they get disarmed-- we’re just selfish you sound like it congrats to laura and travis no it's not misery it's beautiful and amazing and incredible the day's not over for me at least let's move
