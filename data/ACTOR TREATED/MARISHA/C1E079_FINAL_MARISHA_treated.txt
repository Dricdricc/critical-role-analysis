you should watch it and also everyone likes coupons end of statement also there was a playlist that we put out that is a collection of all of the artists that we have boosted over the year except for one because they're not on spotify and it's not my fault but yeah go check it out and i also wrote a little thing giving some insight into the background of the show you're welcome i'll be here all week yeah not really it's christmas time potions potions that's not too bad not too bad that is pretty good for pike 17 yeah it's pretty good for keyleth oh god i feel like he's real good at everything piece of shit okay i don't know what to do here what are we trying to do do we have a plan should i try and burn a big spell okay before i do something crazy based off of percy saying that i turn to vex and i go by the way i've been meaning to ask you about that if he ever followed through so stay alive we can talk later okay and i pop over the corner and i'm going to cast tsunami that was tidal wave this is like a big daddy version of that this is my 8th-level spell so i create a wall 300 feet high 300 feet long and 50 feet thick of water yeah he's not bigger than 300 feet is he none at all well it's also a six-round spell and he's supposed to get stuck in it nothing no because i'm questioning mine but hey 8th-level spell did you just say that to me holy fuck just on the first round though so it just doesn't keep him restrained 20 it's better than-- yay 8th-level spell to quote matt mercer i'm not digging 26 35 halved but it's not going to do anything to him on subsequent rounds yeah it says any huge or smaller creatures must make a strength saving throw in order to move so he gets to move out of it no problem is that essentially the deal yeah but is he moved back all right i'll take that pike's going to do a thing is that an aoe thing that she's going to do all right here's what i'm going to do i'm going to move in this area over here kind of poke into this building no no i don't want to go that way i want to go behind-- sorry this isn't very-- yes that way thank you yeah sure yeah it's going to be so great it's going to be great i look at him and i go yeah 8th i feel you man fucking sucks bro all right let's do this i didn't have to roll this looks bad but i feel okay about this i didn't get hit i'm good is that for everybody or just for her oh shit we're going to be real disappointed if you can't take this all on your own are you feeling lucky percy you should have done it wait raishan said that i turn to raishan and say i don't take orders from you i'm only doing this because it's a good plan and then i run in if i run my full movement can i get into touch range with him okay angry at what happened before and realizing that not a lot is probably going to work unless i get ballsy i run in guns blazing and i am going to do contagion on him i'm going to attempt slimy doom in honor of zahra and her teaching us about hentai i know i'm picking the right one i'll do a green one green's good shut up travis ooh that's not too bad that's not too bad plus 12 so that's 28 (laughs) redemption he has to fail three that's all i got right i'm going to turn grog you're still down right i'm going to do a bonus healing word on grog i'm going to go ahead and do it at third-- second level but it's max eight plus six 12 to three so 16 total burn it burn it burn that shit he has three right goddamn it jarett that's awesome good spell that's good that's good come on this is what you're built for this is why we trained you yeah he also has to save against my contagion he accidentally stepped on one of his elemental friends i feel like i saw you in like the fire plane 'sup man 24 i'm okay i'm on the ground but i'm not super low i'm still full on hit points well did he ever make that save by the way it keeps going it still goes yeah it's a seven-day thing if he succeeds three i thought he just had to fail more damage so you might want to do that at a lower spell level and keep the higher levels for healing here i've got d8s how many do you need it's like when you're in trouble are you shooting kima maybe you'll kill it kill it oh jeez come on man i mean i could have handled it oh boy yeah all right not that one not that one gil don't fuck me gil all right that's not too bad 19 so i still have this asshole in front of me right but he's been pushed back yeah that's cool i will stand up rise up this guy in front of me is almost dead right how far away is thordak from me okay i am going to-- can i move up one square closer to thordak but not get near the-- but i'm in this cloud too shit i don't but that's nice and now i'm going to-- am i oh because of the heroes' feast oh that's right oh well fine right and then i'm going to cast blight on thordak i think so i did i did a thing not too bad 11 17 21 23 25 31 35 35 halved i take a few steps back can i tuck into that little broken building a little bit just inside the doorway perfect how are you doing i don't know how we got here what oh hm yeah okay well okay well then instead (reverse words) take me back i can only do 15 feet all right how many feet am i from the elemental no i'm not going to blow a 4th-level spell on his ass i'm going to do a 1st-level spell though and do a thunderwave yeah yes it does not it takes 2d8 ooh that's good ten damage please kill it please kill it it's a radius oh no sorry it's a cube it's a cube 15-foot cube got rid of that fucking asshole all right and that's all i can do okay now i'll tuck into there there you gomarisha  (half-hearted wilhelm scream) taliesin taliesin it's never not weird oh yeah kima oh shit it can't hurt it's got to save against that shit good job buddy man good thing we gave you that flute yeah wait until we're-- he's on the other side of the continent it could like-- that's better than 11 you can do that yes it was wait over what wall over what wall yeah is this one that zahra and kash were guarding can i do it ooh yeah 25 means they're still alive hopefully the last thing we do is die as we see a bronze dragon show up so she's on top of me more or less i'm going to turn around and tidal wave this elemental behind me extinguishes all flames no the other one was tsunami that one is like the big daddy version of this one yeah sorry percy i'm saving your life man is this damage for percy 21 i'll pop myself out of the door a little bit contagion he has to do that at the end of his turn did he do it at the last so he's saved against two or one he's only done-- i know about one and he's saved against both are you sure all right do i see gilmore then yeah he's not looking too good he has to roll a save does he still have disadvantage on these yeah he has to roll under a five it's resting in peace with my 8th-level spell and her dragon-slaying arrow they're in a puddle somewhere are we going to try and take raishan out as well this is far from over popcorn on a trampoline yeah i want to see how this works oh boy okay i'm going to stand up question is thordak within 30 feet of fire giant dude okay that answers my question then i'm going to reach up and do blight on thordak 'cause i think i can this time 30 feet fucking shit fuck balls okay then-- no i'm in a skirt situation it's not good no it's just clumsy okay i'm going to do-- everything's not ideal right now you don't know i'm not good at that i'm bad at that thing so i'm not a dextrous person so instead i'm going to use my spire of conflux look i haven't forgotten about it all right my ancestors and i'm going to do chain lightning on thordak fail motherfucker fine that's fine it's how many damage like 8d10 yeah i do i need one more oh and i get to reroll ones right that's actually really-- no that's a seven so that's 29 34 plus-- that's a seven and then 34 plus 14 is 48 and there's no one else within 30 feet of him other than raishan no one else well okay i do that and then i turn around and i'm going to cast a grasping vine as a bonus action right next to me and then i'm going to use it to whip around and grab percy and-- i haven't used any movement can i shift into that house a little bit uh-huh and once again cast grasping vine from out of that corner and drag percy to me around the ankles hi she's getting ideas oh no no vax no what if it was 1799 that's basically like 18 do you want some d8s no that's-- oh he's already committed should we do what he does to us 15 15 he needs horse blinders horse blinders can i say over like a headpiece thing-- be like twins if you're still alive i think raishan's coming in your direction yeah we're heading ass-- hauling ass that way fuck that wyvern i say everyone in the hole and i head towards the hole (singing) black as your soul what yeah i'll dash look he's a great security guard kill it real hard what's going on whatcha doing just describe the scene wait till i'm there wait till i'm there wait till i'm there don't let her touch him no no no don't go don't go-- i said don't let her touch him so she's coming towards us i mean she kind of released thordak she's totally little finger where is she are we going after her i mean-- i run deeper into the hole poor jarett we'll go to the spa afterwards 25 i rolled a natural 19 so 22 70 i'm actually still up at-- what's 101 minus 119 18 points yeah maybe she was doing it telepathically team rowdy half-elves what's up half-elves running in recklessly yeah like we do
