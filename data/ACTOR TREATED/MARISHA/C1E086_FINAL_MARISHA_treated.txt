inferior the word you were looking for vexed that's a good word i know percy percy look you can turn this to your advantage brain drain him for all the knowledge you can all right i trust your judgement oh he's definitely a douchenozzle (gasps) i think that's the first time i said douchenozzle yeah he called you 'little elf-girl and little elf-boy' i don't like him what's wrong with my antlers i know my hair's shorter so it makes my antlers look bigger which i was concerned about is it okay thanks all right you know what let's move off this conversation dottie were pen pals a thing for you is that why you like penmanship no did you have any friends ever aww really and they're still alive weren't killed in some crazy raid or eaten by dragons orfell in a pit of lava i thought we got it back though wait no are we talking about the flute i have his flute because i picked it up last fuck we need to speak with him and return this i show the flute maybe they'll recognize it i take it and i dust the ash and drug use off of it and then-- i guess not howarth howarth howarth howarth it's been going around it's true yeah anytime you fly might be a good trial run i want to save traveling the ozmit sea and heading to the water ashari for when pike is back so yeah no we're speaking insanely literally right now that's what's impressive about it and we're taking you with us it's true wait what all right let's go so we're going back to whitestone come on doodee you have six seconds are you feeling nauseous oh my god did you guys hear that he thinks i'm a god doucher douchenozzle that's right that's what it was sorry i'm just learning it yeah yeah in years ago castle courtyards you can trust grog for some things i agree you've never played boulder paper shears (all laugh) boulder parchment shears non-lethal i'm getting in on this i watched him walk up behind him and do it i knew what he was doing this is a part of our vox machina hazing this is what we do wow it sounds like us last week in i want to make decisions no i'm in 16 okay first and foremost i'm going to create a windwall around us like an arena yeah (wind swirling) and then i'm gonna-- yeah i turn to percy and i say man you know i almost feel bad for the guy should i give him a boost should we give him an incentive all right we'll start with a boost and i give him a healing word we'll give him a level two i guess you're worth it oh you got real lucky tary i got a four and a three which adds to be seven plus 13 points and then i say come on tary you at least split his head yeah 23 show me what you got can you do the chargey thing oh that's cool that's cool right if you've vaporized me i'm going to be real pissed yeah new kid's got game what the fuck is that yeah yeah yeah that prismatic spray was impressive what are you gonna do yeah (sighs) should i make this more interesting what haven't we tested yet we haven't really seen him dodge yet right see how well he can dodge and i throw a fireball (explosion) right next to tary i don't wanna mess up grog just tary and doty make a wisdom saving throw why because the fuck did you do i got-- oh sanctuary against spells even though this is an aoe any attack or spell all right so let's roll this one not great that's not great but luckily i got really high wisdom so 18 ow jeez oh my god there's like-- there was like a little twinge i think i was-- no it's this guy i think it's tary wait where's my-- who stole my book fireball i need to know what fireball does what is it 8d6 i got it one-- one two seven 34 damage so he did not dodge though right you sure i drop the wind wall no no this isn't war this is great we were just giving him a little trial run isn't that right tary isn't this great he's fine we knew that as soon as you said you wanted to rescue a damsel we never-- no you notice we tend to make a lot of people cry we make a lot of people cry we told him we were gonna go see hotis and defeat him in the nine hells and we wanted to make sure he lived yeah look at him honestly if you would've led with daddy issues we probably would've trusted you no we just learned that tary's an ugly crier we can't beat him over the head after that i guess we could go ahead and head to the water ashari it should be fairly calm look we're all fuck-ups we like people who show their vulnerabilities or a douchenozzle too much okay there are other ways of being a hero than being an adventurer there are a lot of ways you could be a hero yeah people who spend a lot of their earnings and people who are more privileged like you who help people in less privileged places yeah people generally like them i can cast spells and so can vex here it's through my antlers so respect the antlers respect we could do a little roleplay exercise like in your stories full disclosure full disclosure tary there aren't many damsels you have to rescue in the wild i've learned mainly because women in the world have to be tougher so that doesn't happen very often but if you want we can make pretend and do a little thought exercise and i'll pretend to be in distress and you can rescue me if that'll make you feel better yeah but you have to vanquish grog okay (all laugh) yes yeah and look you singed a little of my hair yeah yeah get drunk and make people cry pike i have to eventually go visit the water ashari but i didn't want to do that without you is there any advice you can give all right okay aw that was a good exercise in restraint grog proud of you so how long have you been set forth on your little mission to prove yourself worthy welcome aboard the proving-yourself train (gasps) wow your dad really is an asshole what marion darrington (laughs) maria she's a maid marion that's fun i'm concerned-- i'm sorry i'm confused tary that was a freudian slip why does your father think it's important to have brute strength and combat experience to run a business are you sure your father's a real estate agent that's a long walk to get to shithead what's your father's name i removed it i burnt it off of him hashtag clasp interesting you know percy is a bit of a tinkerer himself as well built it on our little summer vacation did he just give us an iou legally maybe i think more than a few do you want us to excuse the two of you all the people who tend not to like people are liking him i feel like the two of you never like the same person i thought we were taking a break from risk-taking for a second i love the way you frame things percy i love the way you lawyer your way out of every situation i could check in on him haven't used the scrying eye today i'm gonna look i take out the scrying eye what why boulder parchment shears why we just want to make sure he's okay he can't know if i'm scrying on him not if i use my scrying eye all right deposit the checks we haven't had the night off in a while pike wants to go all right all right do i know roughly where the water ashari are not in whitestone i think we're pretty landlocked is there like a port at the very south end of the continent to where we could hop a ship and also do some research stillben oh western oh you mean western okay well then hang on if it's w-- nope 'cause the earth ashari are on the eastern side of the continent right of our fake world-- so emon is like-- so we might as well leave out of emon and then i could also do some research because-- is the libraries and the lyceums and stuff open again or are they just fucking demolished yeah unfortunately i can't-- i've never been there and the ashari are a very reclusive type people have you read about the water ashari and the ashari people (whispering) sam do you wanna touch my antlers ignore that that got weird i mean i guess i could always go back to the earth ashari or the air ashari and talk to some of those people i don't know i guess we could go back and talk to the earth ashari you guys haven't been there yet yeah all right right now with it being the season of- oh we'd have to hike to get there no there's gotta be trees that i can tree stride there to we're druids there's gotta be trees within that camp right and stuff like nearby okay oh my god he doesn't know any of our names we're like a bad speed dating session holy shit oooh he's still got it no no not becoming a catchphrase are we going are we going going going gone gotta go got everything earth people first so we can be like where do i find the other fourth of my tribe yes i've got my safety tags i'm good i'm good yes all right let's go respect respect the antlers i like decorating my antlers it's a traditional ashari tradition well we are in the central cliffkeep of tal'dorei and of the central-- of the cliffkeep mountains yeah (all laugh) yep it's always like 20 degrees warmer in the valley i like tary stop-- no no these are-- grog everyone wait for a second i step forward a second is this patisse do i know dryden from before all right right yeah yeah kaitiaki dryden how are you have you fared well here recently in the past several months have you talked to cerkonos or korren at all we have slayed the chroma conclave all the dragons are dead yes i was wondering if i could speak to headmaster patisse i am intent on continuing my journey on to the water ashari tribe and i need information from him is patisse indisposed i mean it would just be nice to like say hi while i'm here at least i'm like a new yorker on a subway i'm just like whatever used to this oh it's built-- we've got infrastructure built for that sort of thing it's fine they're used to it here rockcaller rockcaller oh jerry how you been how's the kids jerry jerry i stand more in attention more formal good to see you patisse it's been quite some time i just came to check in after the recent events in the world make sure everyone was okay that's correct we've also slain his right-hand man raishan who seemed to be the mastermind of the entire orchestration thank you i couldn't have done it without your help and training so i appreciate that well i'm intent on continuing on with my aramente now that there's relative peace in the world the vesrah people are quite insular of course i was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to get there and any advice in general on dealing with them right who's their headmaster there now do you know uvenda uvenda the heart of the tides what can i expect of this uvenda uvenda that's very vague of you patisse no you've got a point do you recommend by ship or would flight be more appropriate all right any other words of encouragement oh sorry i probably should've introduced-- by the way this is my band i've been traveling with vox machina and tary tary darrington he's new of course yeah that would be awesome yeah are there any other landmarks or ways of navigation to find them they're an island in the middle of the ozmit sea (quietly) awesome yes we were going to look into trying to do that well is there anything you need from me patisse before we head on don't worry we have many places we'd prefer to keep this way thank you for your belief in me kaitiaki patisse (quietly) good job what did you say yeah we can i'm good after this we'll probably have-- no i'm good i mean-- and then i'll be resting are we gonna do the airship or-- no i guess we left the airship in whitestone or did we leave it in emon hopefully it's-- you know let's see if it's still intact that's true you guys wanna go on a boat wait does this mean-- does this mean we can get yacht gear if we go on a boat-- or pirate gear pirate gear you mean like keds you're talking about keds boat shoes (laughs) i have a kit for that (laughs) well that's fun i do the touristy thing to 'em again on the way out like i do (stammers) our keep greyskull keep garden tree sorry that just took a while to find in my brain (stammers) it's been a long few weeks only the best only the best yeah cap damon oh yeah and it trickles down pike's here right she's in the city 'cause i imagine she would have good recommendations on good crews-- -- and boats so let's try and find pike would pike know if there's a good crew let's save ten minutes on finding pike would pike know if there's a good crew okay to the docks ter the dercks i'm not good at investigating who's good at investigating dockmaster oban abban a-b-b-a-n oh man grog that's-- that's not like free peanuts at the tavern the profile of that you look like a pirate where do you buy your clothes yep that's right southwest have you stumbled upon vesrah all right not pirates and you are definitely not-- --a pirate nope you just look really cool oh we don't need weapons we're weapons we're the most deadly thing in this land often enough drensala vis did she just say crazy water people i don't think we need anything do we need anything i will come stacked with some water-breathing stuff i think we can do it to eight people for like an hour or something like that that'll definitely help it's gonna be like a seven-hour trip-- or a seven-day trip adella oh been on the sea a little long is your crew ready to go or would it be better to set sail in the morning okay moana it just slowly sinks ocean voyage we're going on a cruise you guys now we learn how shitty cruises are well and pike well pike's not here-- that was so good
