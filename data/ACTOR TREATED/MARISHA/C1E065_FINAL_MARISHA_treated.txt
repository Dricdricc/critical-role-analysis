soundbiting it up in that it's like you're an actor well they nominated us so we got this far because of them and now we lose to markiplier and sean becker who's my director for signal boost all in the fam in which particular way do you mean aside from all of them you're talking too much it's not like i've made myself very accessible either it's not on you it might be a little on you but it's on both of us anyway my point is for the longest time i was terrified that i was going to lose you first to death and then to the raven queen which is still kind of like death and then ultimately to yourself and then i had an interesting talk with pike recently and she said something that really stood out to me and that was that some people just have more of themselves to give and i realized this whole time that i was afraid of losing you to a future that ultimately has not yet been written which is stupid but you're ultimately right we have nothing to lose i love you vax and i'm sorry for being me that it took me this long to say it yeah me too that is pretty great yeah high five yeah and that's it for now bacon trying to wrangle a beast and what's our intent in marquet to get the next vestige yeah it's located in whitestone castle correct the teleport sigil they said it hunted something really intense recently yeah they went to the ocean but i wrote it down so it wants competition the slayer's take should know they've got contracts everywhere we thought about it a little wait are we talking about capturing another dragon to fight another dragon no more small boys percy no more do they look like townspeople any kids i do want to maybe talk to gilmore though as cynical as percy is being right now he's right but it doesn't mean that kashaw is going to think that it's any less important and i'm sure he might not take it as a compliment if we ask him to be the messenger boy yeah but do we know of any other dragons here let's talk to kashaw we go up and we talk to kashaw we need a big beast on draconia yeah see i'll lend it to them for 100 years we're basically doing a contract for free if they lose they don't lose anything either right but wouldn't the contract just go right back into cycle they're used to having people die i think grog's getting antsy hit him in the nuts what do you need a writing desk for yeah how's the letter going yeah actually what kashaw yeah we're going to be here the rest of the day right druids people wizards sorcerers all right let's go to the sun tree oh come on man why are you doing this to me (laughter) fuck you i hate you so much right now (laughs) uh-huh i love drinks so much what kind of a drink yeah well look you know it's really complicated right now and i'm trying this whole allowing myself to feel things thing oh man i don't know how to respond to that i'll see you on the other side we'll put a pin on this one bye kash and i cast it through the tree and i push him in yeah he's gone sounded like he was under duress can i do an insight check 15 the den of druja jaja shaun are you doing okay you look a little worn out i could only imagine a barrier of this size of a construct can be quite taxing on one's physical energy we should have a spread of our survival kits yeah what was that scarlet prison you just mentioned under the what now i've never stolen anything shandal yeah maybe we shouldn't it's a city that has no water we shouldn't make waves jarett was there still a control of water going on while you were there is there anything we should know about that and jarett will you keep an eye on gilmore for us i think he's just working himself a bit much thank you to market yeah more water's good yeah we've tapped them out there slowly very slowly oh yeah i bust out some of my clothes from the fire ashari go lighter does his little sachet-- well i was going to say does his sachet need a re-up of herbs i thought you stuffed it with something what's the decoration like in the room ooh whispers how are those cowboys doing travis oh snap she's learned from you well he did say we would meet his family hi tal'dorei can i do like a nature check or take note of what he said so i remember because that was vague do we have any more reason to be here or should we start heading off to ank'harel i can mist us i brought it today wait can that happen because we're mist sorry i just spit all over you i'm sorry that's how mist form works i don't think we'd evaporate i think he's fucking with us i don't think we'd evaporate they fade into existence i don't think we'll evaporate do we need anything else while we're here before i do this i mist us before i go i say stay in school kids and then i mist i was trying to inspire them sliming them follow traffic yeah we're just sweating a little bit more do we condense a little bit turn into a low-lying fog never mind wind walk you said it was a day's journey and we can travel faster by wind walking i think we should be able to get there right because we have a flying speed of 300 feet an appropriate cloud height hundreds a couple hundred feet it's been five or six does there look like any patch of shrubs or a low point in the terrain cover i don't think they'd take kindly to surprises yeah i'm assuming that that's the hand of ord that we're looking at no he said the hand of ord is the name of the peacekeeping guards in the mansion so not really camping we're glamping yeah let's not mist down in the middle of a group we're deciding how far so 200 yards and if we get caught they're going to know we didn't sign in correctly i don't see any trees and those guards look heavily funded that looks like expensive armor they're all wearing okay the people who are camping what do they look like pretty common folk i'm assuming okay are we going to talk to any of them i go in yeah i think we're just strange no one sees anything you're using a luck you are so walk of shaming right now (laughter) talk it out right now i thought we were going into this one with honesty thought we agreed to that we're ambassadors from emon our normality is dishonesty so technically we're switching it up we're not honest so let's try it for once i feel like that's pretty compelling (sighs) we have to be careful with our word choices with him oh that's a really far stretch the king merchant warrior no not that one who the fuck are we trying to see what was the name of the district suncut bazaar fight well we should probably start with a tavern people tend to know things in taverns is that in the suncut bazaar or could we head that direction while we look i'm desperately trying to commit every direction to memory do you spice do there appear to be any fruit merchants there's not many things no can i go up to one of the fruit merchants apples oh
