bonding moment frumpkin took care of me and protected me okay bye and we go no (whispering) but we found someone and something we like to have fun at our job nice plate armor by the way (clicks tongue) it looks expensive i toss the box to nott catch we want you to open it fucking open it sam open what that you were-- we already threw him money which means you're going to tell us who paid you come on man don't make us do this the hard way we're trying to be good who paid you (deep breath) come on what was the agency you sub-contracted from i know how this shit works thank you as well as the fact that you spit in my face i'm going to leave that here we're going to cross out these doors none of it happened oh yeah do you want us to do that like ooh ah you got me in my kidney that's rare as we're walking over i whisper to fjord and i say avantika's going to want the paintbrush avantika's going to want to know about that paintbrush yeah but bouldergut was there bouldergut saw everything so unless we want to bribe bouldergut-- i have to pee too that's so cute where's bouldergut to me okay one less pirate and one less shipper trying to prove himself a hero thought he could stand up to the lot of us well we didn't kill him but we definitely embarrassed him thoroughly something that i find some men find worse than death i heard there were some very good tropical fruits super rare in this crate based on what i found (clicks) good meal later on i slip her 30 gold i'm not-- i'm trying to-- oh my god are you serious oh is it that's still not great that brings me to an 11 it is a one nope it's a one fucking hole in my pouch shit how did that-- thank you good show everybody everybody great time just wanted a round of applause captain tusktooth sorry quartermaster tusktooth formerly captain for us anyway it was a good day what are people doing we act casual i sensing my biff casually i turn to ipess and say hey man great work down there how great was that so impressive right i fucking-- right saw that adrenaline pumping anyway good day man i go downstairs i'm trailing them i try to find caleb they do that genuine question have you been telling this story the entire time i've been gone that's great you know what i have something i think that you would be deeply interested in maybe i didn't fucking goddamn it i didn't find fucking books okay books cats i get it that's so good love your fascination of both the most boring things that i can think about including books and cats but let's go look at something awesome just keep your mouth shut for like 30 damn seconds follow me we bring him to them hi shh come in shut up did anyone follow you shank shank shank (laughter) do the thing figure it out yes just not about cats and books in the meantime i'm like oh my god so what happened is it like a tattoo when are you going to do a tattoo on me i opened the box this is the paintbrush and the ink caduceus detected magic and it was glowy that's what i'm saying so i need to figure out what it is i've had an idea for just a little bit so this is going to be stupid you're not fucking-- the not there fairy not there i have this idea because molly on the back of his coat his neck his tattoo on the back of his tattoo he had an all-seeing eye and i just i don't know i thought it was really cool i feel like it could be cool to have it on my back right below my neck yeah oh yeah maybe it would like i stole it from him yeah you know he's dead so what's he going to do we'll do that later yes i was so hoping for this isn't that an old chinese folklore a magic paintbrush it's the magic paintbrush there'll be real dicks haha dick joke this is a real conversation we actually need to have with the entire group present speaking of except for fjord yeah i feel like before port we need a plan before port i don't want to waste that we could just steal a ship fjord oh i was going to say i go get fjord casually but like i don't want to interrupt like a cocktail party i do the when you're ready just (clicks tongue) just where we are technically anyone can use a shield but if you're not proficient in it-- because we've just covered this in our handbooker helper episode uh-huh i told him when you're ready this is where we are i have a lot of ideas how do you feel about floating dicks all right of course wow i mean it feels like a bucket list item checked off the list but there were several times that i might have questioned everything that we were doing i mean we just had the full pirate experience that a travel agency could not provide it was very authentic and that was amazing huh down to fire still having those dreams then in a good way or a bad way or is it dependent on the operator but you think that one of the other's spheres is at the bottom of the shipwreck not necessarily a temple but you-- fjord and he traded it for power well at least she would be twice as powerful as fjord is one i mean there's also-- which is inside of you uh-huh yeah do we (whispering) need more information (whispering) to find your ship sotto i was debating heavily in watching avantika to see if with a distraction of trying to board the pirate ship today that i can maybe sneak into her office with the distraction but i noticed she was very adamant holding back and watching the entire scenery it was not safe to go into her quarters if we need to get into her office i think it's going to have to be an important enough and big enough distraction (whispers) you're doing great i think if we don't do anything it means your eventual demise unless we beat avantika to the punch oh is that it is that our meeting okay yeah yeah because i volunteer you want me to help seduce avantika all right oh it's early it's four o'clock okay i'm going to make some barrels what what does that mean is there like an advent calendar less than a year yes queen yes fucking triangulation shit because we were over here right in the reefs uk'otoa i mean if it's a triangulation-- well this is where we're going technically this is the shipwreck right this was where we were there's another reef here then there's torrid reef here do you know in which direction the ship was heading maybe he knew where to go and he was heading there to get his gift said beau in a morning breakfast conversation or something oh my god if someone's allergic they're fucked yeah all of us we've seen this before okay 20 not natural 11 that sounds super inviting dope wow okay oh no (whispering) uk'otoa the bloated cup oh my god marius yeah marius the mariner lepual le-- lepain lepual lepuain i don't know that's all i got oh caduceus the juices how do you mean okay yay yeah i guess we'll follow mm do we live with plans we had a vague idea don't we need to pay them more whoops so by touching down on the island you become a member we're a part of the revelry i don't know if that was the easiest membership i've ever obtained or the most difficult membership i've ever obtained it's kind of hard to say that's for him to do travis no for me to do it's for the quartermaster he said divvy up treasure european british giant shit hear hear i'm beau some call me tracy disdain for organized crime in the empire oh yeah do you have a favorite cocktail at the bloated cup a brew or-- right course you do all right bye roof snipers how much i yank away from him move on am i that transparent how much on average do you pay him to not kill you and if you didn't share your spoils right there's a war on another continent and we're not a part of it
