it is very-- yeah yeah i feel like i need a desk in front of me sorry i was just hype-manning you yeah what besides people leave at the end of panels we all know this they want to get to game of thrones we were going to call it vox machina assemble but apparently that's already taken so still working on the name this way thank you and here travis and bye box of donuts i love you going through the 500 hours that we've-- there's a lot of math on it online more of a parabola-- i thought the joke would break my fall (gasps) that's right there was that fanart there was that fanart where we all come back as cows and percy's like what i mean there's no-- darin de paul in the house yeah sprigg's amazing travis and you're awesome what we would like them to be i'm now envisioning vax as bird person from rick and morty hi dagger dagger dagger i'd be all about a half-orc keyleth aww that's going to happen now you put that into the world go tess go go do it is bryant park still doing the summer movie festivals where you can do free movies new york's amazing or by being a student flash that student id card everywhere hi michelle like across all universes or in ours i think based on our last battle royale and me and you going toe-to-toe it'd be me and you to the end man we'd be terrible to take on we'd never die man we are way overcomplicating this we are overthinking this way too much people wonder why vox machina does this we're just like this this makes me want an injustice critical role dlc can i be matt's illusory beholder from the last episode (laughter) next question yeah in a weird way it feels like the longest longform improv yeah part of the reason we did the playlists is because we were all already doing them and then we thought awesome we'll publish them out and the playlists-- i think it's actually a good tip for people trying to find their character who might be new to it is build a playlist for your character it informs a lot and it gets you in the mood right before you go (laughter) yeah yes cute that's not true i told you a bajillion times we would just do it i've told you a bajillion times we would do it gaslighter currently-- keyleth is-- she hasn't said it out loud in-game yet but she will but she's thankful for being taught how to love by a certain rogue ooh hey y'all want to do some guest playlists yeah sure i want to see bacchus grog now only wearing a grape leaf i mean i'm voice of the tempest so probably some weather (laughter) basically turn into storm everyone's least favorite x-man no that's arranged for dazzler probably right the ones in arcades where you got in it that was a great game was secret of mana 16-bit or was that 8-bit secret of mana i loved that game yeah light applause light applause manleth (cheering) i think keyleth would be like i knew it can we jump into shield of tomorrow and do a star trek crossover i'm into that once again never mind i feel like we can't go through all the fanart-- we do but after the after-show reactions and responses we can't really go through it as much anymore i think it's that the development's never over the world is always affecting the way you go keyleth fell from pretty high and got dark literally smeared on broken rocks that was shocking i'll pick that no man almost got through a panel i push him out the window at the taco bell yeah i feel like for us at the end of the game for matt he's like (sighs) done for the week and i'm just getting revved up i'm just saying your stress seems to happen before the game and mine happens after so the whole time i'm like i mean i don't know what's the raven queen's deal is she to be trusted i don't know and he's like-- i'm just talking to a brick wall
