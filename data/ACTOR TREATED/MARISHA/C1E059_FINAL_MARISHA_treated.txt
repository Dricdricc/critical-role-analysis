by the way of the air ashari-- oh right for a hot second but then she took grog-- i druidcraft a tal'dorei daisy and give it back to-- i didn't mean to hurt your flowers sorry can you not get it back

you teach people how to do that because that's awesome you know what i'll talk to you later about it i really like her yeah any assistance is more than greatly appreciated i sniff percy it's nice it suits you it's very masculine it's a musk as we walk away i give percy a wet willie no i give you a wet willie it's not a ranged attack i still don't say that's a ranged attack wet willie is happening consider that payback (laughter) see that is a ranged attack you know and to be fair barkskin it's all right barkskin is temporary oh the blindness i don't know do you want to be healed or not percy jeez first you say you're mad at me and then you ensnare my melee wet willie-- wait percy say you're not mad at me anymore say hey i know i've done things in the past to piss you off-- yes yeah are you going to hold this one against me because i picked a flower like how you held the clasp against me hold against me like the clasp it's okay i come up from behind and give him another wet willie see i got you even when you had your eyes all right what what all right we'll keep moving 25 while we do that i take percy's barkskin and i regal it out i give him moss epaulets grow some flowers on it give him a little whitestone flower crown i'm making him a fancy tree it stays at a constant correct we are moving towards dusk correct we're moving towards the setting sun she said it was two days' travel do i see any birds or anything like that in the sky any wildlife any critters sorry 21 yes 21 what things get prettier as they get older here that's not fair damn it let's get back-to-back shall we i'm going to go back-to-back to the twins he looks good too right yeah oh (gasps) teach you i don't know but i'd like to try yeah that would be fun okay can i do something like that see the thing is you have to get the accents right for each critter or else they could get a little offended totally i keep going so one of the things that i like to do is embody the animal and that can get you in the mindset let's practice being trinket together i go up to grog (sniffs groans) i give her a thumbs up the accent's really good you're doing a good job it's very good keyleth wipes away a little tear i will turn around how far away are we from the treeline yeah we have been moving away she said two days south but you were saying she was using two days in a way that we would understand we'll never find each other again do we still see the flashing light in the distance that she saw is it erratic amazing almost wait maybe the bigger one look at you oh yeah compare notes what's the matter are you scared yeah you guys should compare notes cross-references are always good you could help us the hunk of quall it's expired can i go find his feather quill that he dropped okay oh man he nailed you grog is this just your hobby your pastime or are you an actual records keeper for whatever town this is because both would be humorous what's the name of this little town here that we see and where do you live when syngorn's not here we're in the feywild also a bath we missed the sloth so if anyone wants to bring out an otter i'd be okay with that too that's so random but i'm into it you're going to get an e-mail tomorrow being like matt guys let's have a carpet picnic tonight can we have a carpet picnic because we're in the feywild it seems appropriate i just thought it would be fun thank you i sit down next to the satyr and i stare at him like this a little bit do you shed do you grow a thicker coat during wintertime do you grow horns that's awesome can i pet your fur is it coarse where do you steal these things are you a pickpocket are you not having fun we want you to at least enjoy yourself you must know something or else you wouldn't stay out of it does it have a name what's this called but you'll take us to our final destination remember you have to be nice to things in the feywild this is what we've learned what is he doing not have him at all the people we're stealing from better be meanies though and they better have deserved it at some point well garmelie also said they were strengthening up an army did they ever have a standing army before i can help percy can i help with a mending spell i thought i used it as a ritual spell before i thought i learned it i don't know can i use it as a 1st-level spell guidance druidcraft i used druidcraft before for the wooden thing can i use druidcraft to help this what's it made out of is it made out of wood we're vox machina yeah really what happened what did you feel okay yeah i actually have dispel magic right now i'll touch vex and cast dispel magic and see if anything happens wait take off all magical items first well take it off i don't want to risk dispelling anything it's like wearing metal in a really hot sauna you just don't do it come on all right i'll do the big guy come on big guy oh that's okay my wisdom just my modifier 22 that was a very high wisdom roll do you feel anything i can also try a regeneration spell i have a feeling if he shook your hand and did something like scanlan said it's probably a pike thing like a remove curse it's got to be something more like that mine is all nature-based i can try to regenerate you but i don't think this would fall under that i have a feeling it's like if you stray from a contract or something you might feel it i don't know that's what i would think i put a blanket over the satyr and i pet him now that he's asleep is his fur coarse or is it soft okay good night are you going to take a point of exhaustion for that so you're close yeah you're doing good i sleep and i dream of fireflies and the feywild because it's so magical son of a fuck draw me like one of your french girls this is brilliant wait scanlan why do you look normal i love it you guys we have a souvenir we have a souvenir from the feywild what are you going to do you fascinate me no we did that for you do not abuse this that's right what happened to don't hurt or touch anything in the feywild as he pouts i druidcraft a little flower crown for him he's so fun to mess with wait take and roll up the painting the charcoal drawing that he did and put it in the bag of holding will it stay in the mansion but i know things will also get ejected from the mansion okay i'll leave it vex should we be dressing for the occasion should we put on our nice cloaks yeah cloak me our nice cloaks i'll cloak up try and look like i made some sort of effort i'll do a little cantrip gust over top of us to make one of those air umbrellas that would never work in real life mandrakes oh cool 21 i look up on the wall is it coming from archers on the wall not quite a warm welcome poo syldor such a dipshit
