imgur we're really doing this i can't believe you guys are doing this for him max yeah bishaft it's made of fucking cookies you have evasion what just get them all out yeah we were saying our daily prayers yeah it's called get the fuck out of our business sorry i've been on a boat for a very long time you're sure we shouldn't let fjord know or we should just handle it do we kill them no (quick footsteps) before i go down i go fjord sorry for being a dick then just go it went downstairs let's go (whispering) okay what is it (whispering) oh that's cool natural 20 thanks for that blessing i put on my night-vision goggles (whispering) what you can be scary i look at nott (whispering) you me flank let's go (quick footsteps) okay okay okay who the fuck are you though seriously okay i feel like we're-- we're letting the cuteness distract us why were you hiding sorry sorry why did you feel the need to hide what did you do i can relate i'm so nice okay i got-- ah it's happening hey twiggy now that you've looked at the fragment you're bonded to us which means if you betray us we'll know how to find you is there-- yes marius please god save me marius let's go that's what we found this is twiggy i call caduceus over caduceus we found a twiggy she was hiding she stole this this ship where are you from you're a gnome right don't gnomes live for a pretty long time so you could actually be fairly old-- -- and look pretty young you don't know you don't know how old you are fascinating i don't think she's as young as she seems he has an octopus interesting was this in port damali yeah it was super freaky actually i'm a little confused at your implication as well as fjord gets the boat going i follow after fjord do you need help getting the boat-- ship sailing ship moving whatever am i the only one that's not beguiled by her charms twiggy me neither anything that cute-- have you ever noticed that pomeranians are the nastiest dogs you've ever met they're poofy they're super adorable they'll eat your face that's a solid option like a plan d she definitely has some magic capabilities she cast this illusion that made her hand look like it was extending i think it was supposed to be cute but you know that uncanny valley it was a little weird it's unsettling hey i have another question since you're captain now right you're captain will you train me to be your first mate really okay yeah okay deal sorry again for being a dick i think i've been a little bit on edge with the boat it's really just a knee-jerk it would've happened if it was anybody you could've been a scarecrow and i would've been like fuck off bro okay let's go it actually works pretty easily you just add a line and then you paint over that i agree with caduceus these are registered deadly weapons actually going off of that because i meant to do this last episode did avantika have anything fabulous in her wardrobe we were opening it up i take one of her darker overcoats jester gives us a fashion show are you still learning tattoos from orly and his first mate so it creates things it creates money it creates gems and it creates holes to-- welcome to the mighty nein do it again nott do you want to go in a hole it's still a foot well he says it lasts a minute when we've timed it all right i'll do it yeah caduceus grab my feet just in case just grab my feet drop me further goggles yeah i grab a few pull me back what is my face it was super dark i hit a barrier it felt like it was a barrier of stuff oh shit do we know what language that name hails from it was cloak and stuff it was cold in there i don't know he's saying that the staff heats his hands and there was a cloak maybe wherever this haversack was from-- it feels like someone was raptured and we're stealing their stuff that's what it feels like i go to fjord you've told us about the halas thing is this perhaps something to do with sir cadigan and port damali stuff do you know a cadigan would i recognize the name hadigas no halas to see if this is his old stash that's absolutely horrifying ten i mean you've mentioned sir cadigan being a big old meanie several times what did he do did you witness something it was hala travis and like one of those bomb shelter walls what if you unleash the wailing creature and we have to deal with it it's survival i'll take the gum i'm not proud this is some bones shit i don't-- i think-- we'll talk later that's what i was going to ask it's a forceful darkness and looking at fjord get nauseous does this remind me of any ghostly presence that i experienced before oh my god 11 i'll be after fjord is there any scripture or writing on the-- yeah to like enter this door natural 20 is there any image in the stained glass i think we're about to enter into someone's study 34 oh shit don't fuck me gil 15 that's actually yes and where is that amongst the planes the little ruby amongst the sea is it in between two certain certain planes oh shit what are you serious why does this keep happening to you i was actually technically watching from downstairs shut up marishative 11 beau is going at the same time as the cabinet man some days you lose some days you beat a cabinet (laughter) i look over and i go they're fine and i go upstairs with jester nope i don't give a fuck right now about that cabinet oh it moves now i care a little while she was doing that i was like i feel like i saw him look over here somewhere so over here yeah he's gone yeah he was looking in this area he was like ah and then i feel like i saw his head go over here but then the bookshelf was in the way so i couldn't see what he was reaching for natural 19 thank you gil 24 feels like something recent i think i know what fjord did hey caduceus or caleb can either one of you put light behind this stained glass backlight it caleb yeah i was going to say i have a feeling that's where fjord is i think he touched this thing which yeah i mean-- it's maybe the way out or somewhere else i want one of those while they all do that i go i'm going to see how fjord's doing-- (thud)-- and hit the ruby oh sorry oh shit my actions affect other people fuck oh no you're good 12 this feels like a lot 15 i turn to jester and i go fjord just fucking vanished again and i go i don't know how this works i take out the red elemental gem that i've had for a very long time and i use it i was going to say i smash it but then i felt that might be deeply irresponsible because then it could just smash badminton i go fuck him up god well i think it's one of those things where if something bad happens it turns on us yeah if i lose concentration but i don't know-- okay what do i-- that's not good nope i did when i was a druid i can also use d&d beyond search what's his initiative uh-huh what's his dex nine nein so i stand i'm going to back up towards this alcove a little bit right behind me yep i'm going to use my bonus action to take patient defense okay i would like for it to get up to it and to do melee attacks hang on sorry i'm going to do the multiattack so two touch attacks first one that's okay wait what am i sorry 18 is the dragon's ac and then one more attack oh yes and it does 2d6 plus three which is five plus three eight and it does catch on fire then it's going to do another attack which i think it fails it definitely fails no it's going to stay there and be like what's up i'm a fire elemental it takes d10 damage eight okay i have patient defense okay dexterity saving throw okay 21 can i use evasion or does that matter right now i take no damage evasion yeah not good you said 57 damage 52 damage wow this is bad i have evasion that's the only reason i'm okay okay yes it hits i rolled a 17 no a natural 17 plus six ten damage hey speak for yourself where are all my friends bullshit i saw fjord dart that way and i heard screams coming from that way-- manly screams i'm going to run this way past jester and check out this hall my speed is 45 what do i see in towards the platform or the casket what's with the casket situation i don't know into the platform i'm going to touch it i'm going to touch the crystal did anything happen i go (shouting) work-- into it (shouting) energy no okay i have a bonus action i'm going to use my bonus action to cast another ki point to do step of the wind and dash back towards the pedestal to the pedestal that's-- yeah as i dart by jester i go fucking crystals and that's it oh but it was so good he multi-attacks no it can't he sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius can he move forward a little bit yeah can he hold his attack in case he's in range yeah i shouldn't have readied an attack first one yep it hits with a 20 which is nine points of damage sorry and he gets another attack oh no wait he can only hold one attack he hits with this one as well i'm sorry 11 i mean i shouldn't have fucking held his attack sam laura and you've got him in range six i can use evasion again right if i succeed fuck yes i rolled a 25 total twiggy it was cold that was awesome fire and ice yeah we got it in range i'm sorry i killed him so i get an attack and sentinel no a four natural 20 five ten plus another 13 damage right it's dice times two it's going after jester is it its turn it takes fire damage too another six oh wait no it's the elemental's turn right the elemental goes after the dragon that's right yeah do the football body slam okay i'm going to run over here to the altar-casket situation and i'm going to quickly check it out what do i do do i still have an action can i try and replicate on this sphere the movements i watched twiggy do to get us here no fucking-- hope it's home there's that whole thing about them which i kind of knew going into this sorry bye oh sorry it's half-dead sorry meanwhile eyy fuck up that dragon kill him oh my god why is he doing that blink kill him kill him with your bodies who saw me bamf out by touching the thing jes for sure did and fjord okay they didn't run ah you had to have seen caduceus he said we're running it's bad and then jumped into a sphere that's some children's cartoon-level obvious yas queen i'm a dummy get out jes you've got to run just run run and pray she can go now if he uses his reaction jester's next right is that a one mm-hmm and 40 hp last man standing twiggy how many hit points did you have you would have been gone to get the reaction yeah that was nott the bravest aww jessie what are you serious sorry thanks twiggy i'm sorry i found your cuteness alarming well that was the weirdest seven days i didn't know i had jester are you all right you're a bad liar sure hey fjord i feel like there's this trend of us feeling shitty after we come out of a fight hmm that was a dragon i don't even know what any of it meant well i guess there's still time to figure it all out it feels like that gold was stealing from the dragon just slowly but surely yeah anyway but he's dead now so what does it matter we could just slowly drain it it's like a never-ending piggy bank that's true i guess i'm going to stay up i don't feel like sleeping just yet copy that captain how are you oddly i feel okay too is that wrong of me i feel like everyone else feels so terribly i think i oddly feel the most comfortable when things are a fraction away from going terribly wrong so did you
