great yeah check it no it's not that would be awful well six to six got to be there may get service oh and it's airing tuesday by the way it's airing on tuesday on geekandsundrycom because no one had any clue-- nice so much fun you should wear a pot on your head all the time it's awesome and it's so good i got a new note-taking pen look at all the colors all right well we know where one is where are these leathers then from the raven queen we need to figure out where the marrowglade loch is do we know where that is no he's on another continent yeah i feel like if pike really needed to get a hold of us she could to be fair kima and i had a rough start too she's i mean i love you kima but i mean sometimes you can get a little bit of there's-- yeah when you mean east you mean like far east like really okay well no there's time it's a new skill i've picked up since we hung out last it's yeah and it has a nice cedar scent when you go through also i need to go by the fire ashari before we really head east-east and they're west so the loch is on the way to the fire ashari anyway z kash you all have been by the loch before would you know what-- i am with vex though i have a feeling that the chance that this item has been completely forgotten is not likely why don't we take the rest of the night to try and do some research is there any way we can find maybe maps or something about ancient history books oh no but i mean we need to find like books about civilizations that might've been here in the past that might get us some sort of-- like a library is there a library there might be some pictures that's the first time i've ever seen vex pay full price for anything perv on wait we didn't have that conversation with her i don't know if that holds up in court vesh i was going to say do you want to mist walk this it would be appropriate this time yes let me see how many people i can do just accept it just accept it just think about it think about being a person again yeah let's turn like people again i guess if we get trapped underwater we could just concentrate and turn into bubbles right that would work theoretically how far away is it under the ice let's stand over top of where it is i was about to do that yeah but i want to go over-- right above it yeah so i have water breathing we could do that too so pretty all right if we rest i can learn water breathing i do i could attempt to see what happened what do you mean there was no plant life strange this was at the bottom of the ocean floor can i do a nature check to see if that sounds like anything familiar and could be a problem it's possible 18 that burrow giant worms are there any underwater serpents it could be a sinkhole it could lead to-- unlikely but it could be a chimney what time is it let me go take a look real quick i can do my beast thing i'll be fine i jump in and go shark form i can't do nature or anything like that can i see if the hole is natural-made or man-made damn it 14 does there appear to be any type of motion or does it look like it's going downward or is it just flat let me do a quick lap around the ruins and see if i see anything that jumps out at me oy 11 does it look to be a similar downward suction thing going on like the other hole (laughter) okay that's the scientific term i bounce out three point landing hi guys yeah fin fin land shark i'm with zahra seems like something scary is probably burrowing down there we'll probably just have to avoid it tomorrow i just snuggle up with trinket hey bud yeah wake me up whenever yeah i grow a basket (whispering) so majestic he lived does it look like the same one (whispering) he made it percy was having-- you were having an episode and locked yourself in the basement oh it's a long story we saved him though and we told him to come here that is true how cold is that lake how big-- you said the lake was like 350 feet-- i can control water i might be able to actually yeah i can focus to part the waters for about ten minutes and then if we don't find anything then i can still cast breathe water on us are there a lot of fish in here yeah i probably can't even get all of it out but let me-- let me see what i can do i guess i cast control water thank you i was going to say actually i think as control water i can also change if it freezes and if it's solid can i freeze the edges of this make an awesome-- i'm just going to focus and keep pushing it out go move fast you have ten minutes i am going to go ahead and start pushing some of the water outwards out of the lake as i'm keeping it pushed i've got a lot on my mind right now percy you all had better be making damn good use of this time i start tossing water out of this lake seeing that they're still doing a lot of work i'm going to start seeing if i can push some of this water out of the lake a bit maybe i start walking towards them yes if we try and go super fast i go and start heading towards the tunnel and pushing all the water outwards let's head downstairs and we might not need to worry about this in a second yes which no one-- and it doesn't even work there paper we get tons of fanart that's paper it's my background now me and pike it's the only ones 'cause it can't fit all of us you have to try and frame it put it on the thing on the paper right on-- right yeah there you go yeah let's all stealth i rolled a natural one 11 do they look to be on patrol are they walking back and forth i poke my head in between the twins and i go do you guys have an earache does your ear hurt i'll stay center with percy is there any moss-snot near percy and i in the middle of the hall can i do a check-- a snot check that one failed me get out of here let's do the wood one oh that's good 29 so it's not from a creature but it is natural you said there's no acridness hey guys i don't trust this goo it creeps me out just be careful i mean we can manage that if you think it's not a dead end i keep an eye on the goo disadvantage do they appear to be raven feathers maybe this was some sort of offering to the raven queen we might be getting close ravens yeah onward scanlan would you like a little bit of-- enhancement natural enhancement of course i reach over and i enhance-- what are you probably going to be using dexterity is this going to be a sleight of hand check i'm going to cast enhance ability and give him cat's grace for his dexterity checks don't lose your hand scanlan we don't have pike to regenerate it right now dear god what was your first roll yeah i'll jump over towards the doors as well oh yeah i rolled an 18 what matt so as all of you start leaping across into this small tunnel right before the doors taking a moment to inspect it the final member of the group right before trinket who rolled a two-- oh no i turn and i cast grasping vine from up here and try and yank him back up good to join us grog like an altar secrets secrets secrets oh shit-- just me and grog four four yeah lucky number four whoa that's good son of a bitch we weren't prepared it's everything-- yeah they've got fear disintegration-- i've got a list i've got a fiends book okay first things first i'm going to-- where's that laser pointer what come on-- oh my god-- do i still have enough time to do a bonus reaction to try and save her with a grasping vine or is she gone (groans) straight dexterity i rolled a natural two i'm going to try and move behind him so-- i'm not like in his eye cone am i no no behind him a bit-- i'm going to cast blight at fifth level on him oh god i'm so afraid so it's going to do 9d8 damage-- anyone give me some d8s d8 me fail it motherfucker yeah all right okay eight ten 15 17 so four more these were at 17-- that could've been better what'd i say 17 plus another seven this is 33 damage so we established that this moss-slime isn't natural it's not like a plant and now i'm going to use my bonus action to go into earth elemental form yes this worked last time do i still have enough movement to where i can like go underground can i do that or no is there any earth around can i like homer simpson (slurps) into the wall okay to be fair i think i still have your enhance ability up-- that's hot you could move out of it plus two it's fucking 18 question did enough stones fall out of the ceiling that might be like me-shaped from the fireball is the ceiling considered worked stone or is it just carved out yeah let's do that like the hole that was already created by scanlan's fireball well i dunno i'm doing the earth glide so-- oh 30 feet do i make it just make it okay and i just want to-- oh wait was that cocked i don't know i don't think so and it's not great no seven that's my turn try it again next time what is happening you can still cast a spell woo did it maybe loosen a little bit of stone up a little bit more oh my god that's bad fucking make this shit make it okay i forgot this last time as a siege monster i can deal double damage to objects and structures i'm assuming this is a structure yeah if i want to like beat through it okay so i'm going to do a slam attack through it come on ah fuck i don't know if that stone'll respond oh this is to the wall though right so 14 to the wall 2d8 plus five five so that's 24 damage to the ceiling i'm just going to try and once again catch him in-- i have two i have a multiattack i can use two slam attacks to like punch the beholder into the ground that's what i want to do okay okay that's not bad that's not bad 21 i'll take it (laughs) oh i guess i just have my dex my strength which is a plus five it was a total for my d20 roll that would be 18 am i like on top of it okay so i just brought him down do i do any damage beast sense beast shape i was wanting to like ride him stand on top of him-- i would've had to like specify that sucks i can't crawl backwards i can't y'know like-- butterfly effect can i do a bonus action then if i fell out of my form and cast a spell as a bonus action can i cast grasping vine no wait no never mind i can't grapple okay i'll cast healing word on scanlan oh son of a fuck i'm in his fuckin' front eye god damn it shit-- cock-- balls-- she critted i run to the edge with vax since i saw fucking kima go over vax is coming down to get you that's hot keyleth actually goes over and starts doing her harvesting thing yeah that's true i'll check out the eyestalks kashaw revivify revivify oh my god i'm shaking what do you mean she could destroy what do you mean kashaw you're running out of time i reach out and i touch vax on his back do i feel or sense anything different i grab kash by the hand and just to him what does this mean how do you feel why did you do that i walk up to vex and i just say you know he loves you very very much so very much i still have one more control water spell i can do and i go with kashaw you know kashaw for a cleric i was concerned maybe you didn't believe in much at all and i was very unsure of how you got all of your radiant powers considering i didn't know what you believed in but you must believe in something so what is it well you did our family a great service today and you didn't have to do that you know you're a good guy too even though you try really hard to pretend not to be thank you for everything you actually think we can do it yeah he is okay yeah and thanks for looking out for me by the way y'know you didn't need to apologize for stealing that kiss before it was fine what really it was my first yeah aww yeah high five question who was your first kiss oh sure yeah yeah no that makes sense cool yeah no it has been-- (laughter) i-- yeah well i c-- we should probably-- that's fine okay well i mean we're-- we'd be passing through it'd be-- just-- it'd be great yeah it's big it's a big big world sure yeah yeah we do still have the fire ashari granted i could theoretically just tree back you guys want to go take a nap at whitestone liam and tree stride see yeah (yells) what did you roll well i thought raise dead just brought them back like to life as a zombie that's what i thought because pike got on him next turn and mary getting the how do you want to do this again
