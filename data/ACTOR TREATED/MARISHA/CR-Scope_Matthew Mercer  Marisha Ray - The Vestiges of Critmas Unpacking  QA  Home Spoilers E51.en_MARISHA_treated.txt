honest delight in hearing from people who love the show it seemed like the most natural thing in the world i found books included in this package are my way of saying thank you for sharing your adventures with us-- oh the books included in this package sorry it's been a long day i found the show at a time when i really needed it laughing out loud was something i hadn't been doing much of

things you create-- (reading quickly mumbling) i can't draw although i'm learning or paint but i recently stumbled-- okay but i can use indesign i recently create and modify forms for a living and i have recently stumbled across a tutorial for book-binding i've enjoyed every moment of learning how to bind books creative and exacting at the same time it's certainly experimental as the first few tries were unsurprisingly failures-- but the good kind where you learn a book with a wrapped book-board cover looks weird let me tell you the books i've sent are far from perfect i shake my first and eat the pages but i'm proud of them in a bit more than a month i've learned to create hardcover books and they're functional individual and fun to create that's amazing thank you for sharing your

or write i had a challenge on my hands i had originally wanted to make grog a coloring book full of pictures of some kind but i didn't want to use others' art without permission so i put some pictures of some of grog's favorite kind of things-- couldn't find good line art of a barmaid-- and left some room for him to be creative inside the box from gilmore's he can take advantage of his vast knowledge of colors grog's character moments are some of my favorites and grog and craven edge are some of my favorite comedy duo happy giving she made him a soft-bound coloring book and an axe and case and a trinket bear and a craven edge sword matt and i'm selfish i want to look and see what all-- oh my god percy has graph paper on one side and notes on the other these are fantastic these are
