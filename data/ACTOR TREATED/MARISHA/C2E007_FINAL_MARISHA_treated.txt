until he casts dancing lights okay sure i will stumble forward i will head towards molly because i'm going to follow his fluorescent purple coat molly molly where are they i-- because i moved and i'm not near anything so i'll take the dodge action they're like market lights so it's pretty yeah (high-pitched) ooh i'm in love what oh i think it's 2d8 thank god it wasn't me this time okay seeing the situation that nott is in i'm going to immediately run over and attack that hyena i'm just going to run up and go yeah get go kick and just kick it real hard git i use my staff as a little bit like a jumping leverage point to give me a little bit of momentum and-- yeah what do i do i roll 1d8 and then double it that sucks but that's six plus four so ten can i do a bonus action to use my med kit on the kid my healer's kit i'll just move over to the kid and hold the wound yeah oh my god he's trying to find a positive hey you're a badass what's your deal holy shit this guy's good is there anyone else that you were with that's no longer with us in there you didn't get taken from alfield how far was that tunnel to the surface we cleared out this side how long is it going to take to hike back the way we came let's do it oh my god i crack boxes like fucking zelda quiet sorry he's nearsighted but you have advantage because he's assisting you let's go yeah i'm so about it he's so cool 25 shh (laughter) do they like each other oh that's right i reached into the ball bearings that i have left since i have about half i take one and go-- (ball bearing bouncing) ah shit he's stupid nott do you want to did you roll the same thing oh shit come back 15 is the magic number i was hoping so i would get my ki point back jesus shitty rolls they're bats just baseball bats with arms (whispering) how many it's like a motion simulator ride whoa it's true no i don't know or our bed's not on braziers no laura and (whispering) okay do it are we doing this do we get a surprise round or an earthquake we're in a shaft things shake a lot it's got a little moss on it from the cave it wasn't cool when arnold said it i'll take the front linemen yeah i knew what that meant oh tackle i'm probably a guard fuck yeah son of a fuck eight what's zip-- seven no i am i rolled a nine sounds great yeah miss okay is it dark in here can i run up to the guy that just came up to jester and wait until that light comes up from caleb hold the attack when i hold my action can i also hold my bonus action with that can i use my bonus action to spend a ki point and do patient defense let's do that i can still attack when it comes right okay thank you as soon as it comes around me i'm going to use the staff with the light as it comes and crack it down over top of his head natural 20 i rolled an eight on my die (sings) max all the way around that's 16 plus four i'm not going to touch you right now i'm sick there we go i'll hit the elbow 20 can i have the light following behind me as i run up fuck yeah i hug the wall let fjord do his thing (whisper) shakäste a rakshasa yeah i turn to shakäste and i say are you a motivational speaker or something he totally did good job yep miss miss see if i can catch another arrow i'm going to do my deflect missile i'm going to try and do like a frisbee catch in the air it's a d10 right d10 what was it six damage five plus my seven so yes (stuttering) we're so cool right now yeah all right i'm going to vault past everybody well never mind they all moved i'm going to run up right into fray right in between the orange guy and the gray guy hit and then i'll probably do my flurry of blows i'm going to run up i'm going to go for a rib shot with the bo it's not a good roll it's not great 12 uh-huh okay yeah wonder if that's a good idea maybe i should-- i'm going to patient defense this again do i have a bonus attack that didn't go as well as i thought that's true come on caleb (cheering) guys i think shakäste makes us better people he makes us better but we couldn't see that (groaning) well i'm suddenly having regrets 17 totally probably wouldn't have even have run up it'll be great yeah in more level i get feather fall that would've been nice thank you versus my strength right i'll take the acrobatics are you looking for patient defense shit oh it doesn't you did this if i die it's on your head oh my god pick the dice that i use i don't want to die (yelling) ugh goddamn it that happened before make a what saving throw (panicked breathing) i'm good at this i had patient defense but-- i do i have to roll at least a 12 that's an 11 please be better (fading scream) busting fingernails (wheezing) it knocks the air out of me so going to be sick i guess hit real good (normally) 11 points oh right hang on (wheezing) i'm good i'm okay oh because your hex thing that's awesome (groaning) fuck that's half of my damn movement is it small enough to where i can do the wedge myself-- is leap from side to side also athletics yeah that one let's do that one monkish okay 19 18 sorry yes did you guys know there's a hole now i climbed out of the hole to two gnolls hole to gnoll cool i did it took everything oh yes fuck you okay okay okay one plus four so five damage (cheering) oh shit oh no is there still an ear left what really oh wait this is to all-- wait oh it was probably addressed to me because of geek & sundry but this is to all of us to the cast of critical role while-- hang on let me make sure it's mine yeah it is a gift for me it's so great they came fully stocked look at that look at how jealous laura is look at that it fuels me i love it yeah i'll take it you have a height that's very identifiable it's a very recognizable level you're on yeah but what happens if they get sacrificed i think that's smart if we can get the baby i bet it would fetch a high price all right i'll go up front with fjord well i'm dexy but i'm not strong but i'm dextrous it depends on what we're talking about are we doing anything with strength checks oh dragging people away is that what we're talking about the rest of us can be on distraction duty yeah until we go nott sure you can have a few i hand him a handful did you just want that because it's shiny oh nott (laughter) 19 we suck waiting to beat face should we creep forward a little what should we do i guess fjord and i will take a good ten feet or so up will you put fjord towards me we'll just wait for nott go nott go i'm a nine sorry do it girl oh that's right so sick okay well it took off flying so that sucks i feel kind of like grog what can i do with that yeah that's lame i don't know what to do i'll move forward and hold my action for light oh where's the priest but i can't see the priest it's dark in here i'm going to move behind jester and i'll just dodge as my action there's not a lot i can do save yourself oh my god are you going for it nott the brave (moans) okay how far away is nott from me okay i'm going to yell at nott i'm going to be like nott the fuck then i'm going to take off in a full sprint towards nott i'm going to go the fuck i grab you again and i scoop up nott and like a football drill i dart and then i'm going to dart all the way back with nott carrying nott like a football okay i want to use my step of the wind ki point ah damn it i was hoping it would be on me the fuck i still run i don't have a bonus or anything right that was everything ooh she's next to me right i'm next to two unconscious people going (screaming) yeah a weakling hindsight advantage there are advantages to both okay we could unload and then run if you hit him he gets to make a save we should go do you want me to put you down what do we do are we running or are we fighting okay i'm going to because i can fuck the priest okay big ol' two-handed staff swing that's not bad 16 nine points of damage ugh okay in response to that i'm going to be like don't patronize me then i'm going to fucking flurry of blows elbow strike him to an uppercut first attack yeah that hits with a 12 natural 12 and then not so good 12 again total six plus four another ten points of damage hang on i messed up that three plus four i messed up seven damage i'm sorry i was adding the wrong modifier i was looking at the wrong guy yes no i can still move right i'm going to now move past fjord and start heading away i'll stay-- that's good aw baby put that shit on your wall describe it i was just going to say i'm going to do a quick scan see if there's anything of interest copy natural 19 22 i'll definitely take the adornments from the priest can i see if i can see in the dark i need night vision goggles was it for the manticore are the runes recognizable in any way hey you all right i grab caleb wrap an arm around him and try to walk him
