hello everyone and welcome to tonight's special one shot honey heist 3 tova's honeys but first i have a few announcements like we always do (cheering) i'm so glad you guys asked it would be terrible so that means i'm going to make content out of it on a very special everythingiscontent this wednesday we'll be joined by a very special art instructor who will teach me how to draw beauregard and that amazing artist is babs tarr the lovely babs is going to try and teach me how to draw thanks yeah we'll see i hope you guys like it that is this wednesday at 500pm pacific right here on twitchtv/criticalrole okay that's pretty much it for the announcements (growling) here we go tova it has been three months since you sent the sweet brothers on their mission to clear fort lox from the control of the bear acuda and hattori bongo of course you've been living the adventuring life part-time but now you are back at the high bear nation headquarters you deliver the news back to sir paddington on the discovery of the balootonium from fort lox the highly explosive honey-based compound that the clan was possessing since then it's been business as usual at the high bear nation at least it has been when you've been there which hasn't been that much which leads us to today a day in which you've been requested to have a briefing with your boss sir paddington now generally he doesn't speak with you directly unless it's pretty big it's meeting time you head down the hall up to the third floor where his office is even though he's never there-- you've actually never met sir paddington in person it's just a little briefing room where he discusses things with agents whenever necessary you get led in by the assistant the door closes hello tova my favorite of the honeys i have a new mission for you that is of the utmost importance are you up for the task we have gotten new information that more balootonium is continuing to find its way into the criminal underworld i know right we believe that whomever is distributing this weapon of mass destruction are doing so by ocean transport i know gasp a single gram is enough to destroy a small town with this many lives at stake i need my top agents on the mission i have granted you access to a full team i have inserted their coordinates into your globear positioning identification system of course being your system it is the one labeled-- roll a d6 for me the brains as you are the brains of the group here is your globear positioning system you can as soon as i'm done debriefing you i know now if you insert the names of the other jobs you can easily find the other agents here in our headquarters those are the jobs of course being the muscle the driver the hacker the thief and a face you always need a good face now once you've gathered the honeys as always go talk to bearsley for future details on your mission go assemble your team track down who's responsible for the supply of the balootonium and bring them to justice make me proud tova i enjoy hearing that it validates me deeply that is me correct all right go form your team you leave it has who would you like to try and find first all right let's go ahead and give me a spin southeast you head down a corridor and you look down on your positioning system and see a little flashing red beacon you see a few of them you head down a corridor down the stairs towards the southeast wing of the high bear nation headquarters in there you see the gym in the gym a hot sexy-looking polar bear by the name of drew bearymoore is working out drew bearymoore would you like to describe yourself as you are now the muscle all right who are you tracking down next going for the face go ahead and spin you head out of the gym take a left and head west all the way down to total far end of the headquarters that's what it's called at the end you can see where this is coming from there's a bedroom of one of the agents that lives on site it's always dark in there you're not sure what's going on you knock on the door this is the midnight maven's bedroom yeah pretty good okay you still need to find your driver your hacker and your thief you type in hacker into your globear positioning system (beeping) you head away from the living quarters and go up a flight of stairs and all the way back towards command office center there's access to lights city information things that a lot of people probably shouldn't have and in there you see bearah pawcett you need a driver and a thief still (beeping) we are going northwest not far from where you are but you head back down the stairs and into the garage and there you find grizz leigh bear thief sure you type in thief and-- (laughing) you all gather yourselves and you head down to the r&d center to meet with bearsley as you approach automatic glass doors glide open as you enter the warehouse-like chamber the lighting is a bit dim and only half the room is really lit from what you can see every inch of the walls are covered in shelves stocked with equipment emerging from the dark side of the room you see an older bear darker fur that's beginning to get a little salt-and-pepper he's wearing a nice suit with a red pinstripe collared shirt and a bright red tie to match this is bearsley you all know bearsley pretty well he's the right-hand man to sir paddington and the only member of the high bear nation to have ever met him in person hello honeys how you doing i hear you're going on the balootonium mission is that true i see the high bear nation's really pulled out their best for this one (laughs) oh well thank you i'm trying to go for a new look you know all right well-- oh grizz you're making me blush even under this fur just the cutest all right honeys let me debrief you here here's what we figured out through our triangulation algorithm that we've invested in here at the high bear nation we believe that stilben which is a port town just east of here is the town that's maybe responsible or at least triangulated that a lot of this balootonium is coming in and out of course we think it's connected through the waterways and stilben happens to be connected to just about every other port on the eastern seaboard now from there it makes sense that it's stilben because it has a pretty big history of corruption and criminal underworld things the clasp has been there for years so we're not really surprised to see that stilben is in the middle of all this you guys remember hattori bongo he was that guy that the sweet brothers uncovered yeah well we have information from one of our informants that one of his associates has been hunkered down in stilben go talk with an old friend over at sunset stride it's a tavern in stilben name of penny our informant informant's named penny clarification correct penny's good yeah she might have some information she's been down there for quite a bit she's gone a little local you creep me out sometimes drew it's like you know things that you shouldn't know it's almost like you've been-- glad that the high bear nation has spared no expense all right-- oh man do you just live here okay do you ladies have any other questions about the mission so far that's a good question we've uncovered five or six shipments thus far it's not a lot but you don't need a lot when it comes to this stuff like i said it all seems to be triangulated back to stilben i think it's the central hub for where it's been shipping out i don't really know though you guys are the brains am i right that's why i'm just a secretary so glad you asked grizz you always ask the right question he hands each of you all a little pill container now these are highly concentrated doses of honey you only get one so use it sparingly if you start feeling a little edgy start feeling your bear side to take over a little bit much pop one of those guys in the back of your molars you'll start feeling calm as a criminal ha anyway-- see grizz likes my jokes he loosens his tie and you know-- we've been working a little bit more on those explosive devices those rifles that we've been telling you about the boom-boom sticks exactly they are ready we only have three though so i'll let you all decide amongst yourself who would like a gun speaking of beautiful explosions we also have this it's a little experimental we only have one that we feel comfortable releasing to you all it's a magical bullet it's a bullet with an enchantment use that wisely last but not least it's a little fun one that the agency has been whipping up i actually meant to grab a prop for them but i forgot x-ray sunglasses now keep in mind-- here you go that's for the thief those are pretty spy-tastic well keep in mind since you guys are all members of the high bear nation it is high bear nation code to each have a globear positioning chip inserted inside of you so i mean-- i mean inserted inside of you not in the bad way it's very handy it is very handy-- -- as dirty as it sounds if you guys get separated you can always turn to the globear positioning system to find one another zoot suit loo very wonderful oh and i should also tell you-- of course normally it would be about a day or so's travel to stilben on foot which is not really the time we have we have one prototype of the thing that we've been whipping up you know you know got a-- you're special so grizz might have gotten a little sneak peak of the blueprints you see we've been investing in a local weapons manufacturer known as ripley they've been whipping up something new for us and it's-- and he goes bleep bleep a rounded soft-bodied coupe spy car pulls up it's got coppery steamy engines a part of it shooting out the back of it it's painted this horrible pinky-salmon color that's a little too fleshy for your comfortability it's like you see what they were going for it's got racing stripes down the side of it that break up the very penis-y looking color that the car is made out of he goes this here is the-- he says this is the ripley model 00 salmon 00 salmon trust this little baby it should get you there in about an hour speaking of putting in front of you-- (yelling) just like any good car you have to turn it on (car noises) there it goes as you hit that button-- that's the music button a compartment opens up out of the back trunk and a swarm of bees flies out of the car no and more bees oh wait what'd you push okay and then (mechanical noises) it closes off it'll stop eventually i don't know it's a kid's toy well we thought we would arm it with some weapons for you guys-- it's a swarm of bees it's got a few more surprises so i'd be careful as you figure it out as you get on the road i trust you with anything grizz that's okay it's a prototype oh i'm sorry it's-- i hope so honeys i think that's all i've got for you well-- i've got your tracking id all right honeys go have a good mission any other questions before you go thank you midnight maven i think you'll recognize her when you see her she knows how to wield her sexuality she's been-- yeah she's great all right everybody remember stay together the high bear nation is behind you all right one more quick-- i'll do this as bearsley quick rules dump since i haven't done that for those of you-- yes for those of you who are watching honey heist for the first time here's how you play all of these wonderful ladies have six points total they are now starting with three points in criminal and three points in their bear stat whenever they want to do something i will decide if it's more of a criminal thing or more of a bear thing they will roll a d6 and hopefully roll equal to or under their current stat that would be a success above would be a failure if a plan is going poorly i might say that the bears are starting to get a little frustrated and then they will have to move one point from criminal to bear if things are going well with the heist they might start getting a little cocky a little greedy and i might call for them to move a point from bear to criminal you always want to stay in a nice happy middle ground if you get too far into criminal and you get all six points there you will go insane you will betray the party you will lose your mind and bad things happen if you get all six points in bear you go feral you lose your mind and bad things start happening if you are doing anything that is related to either your special bear skill depending on the bear you are or the job that you have you get advantage we'll call it you get to roll 2d6 and pick the better result probably the lower one since you want things to be lower here yeah it's kind of disadvantage but it's a little backward so yeah one is like a nat 20 even though there's not nat 20s in this game oh wait oh my god i almost forgot he says whoa wait you don't want to leave-- i almost forgot-- without your humanoid attention translocation supplies aka your hats dani and okay roll a d8 it is a top hat would you like gray or green drew bearymoore roll for me this is the classy brigade over here you get the gray top hat maven why don't you roll for me while they figure this out roll one more time because that's the only hat we do not have you get to roll twice roll one more time okay that we will take you get the indiana jones hat oh my god it's meant to be okay you get a fez would you like the super shriners-y one or the plain one grizz you get the crown you beat me to it i was going to say you look like you're going to a taylor swift concert bachelorette party being the face would you like a fez a cowboy hat or a bowler gray or green matches your outfit or no you're the brains i'm sorry you look amazing okay with that you are all suited up you are ready to go all right you all have your supplies you're heading to stilben you have your car [engine revving] you all fit it is perfectly fit for all six teammates almost like it was built for it as you turn on the car and slowly pull out the garage doors open automatically and you have nothing but open forest road ahead of you it does it is a giant air horn this is all pretty much like a steam and coal powered car it does it very closely resembles the one that tova has the radius isn't too far on these so you do get a little bit of the area in front of you you know you need to head east you know being the driver that this does have a little bit of a speed boost option on it hit that button it goes into turbo mode you jettison down the road you see trees flying past you you do know that if things get out of control the red stop button is a parachute this car has a few more tricks up its sleeve i'll let you decide when you want to figure that out roll twice and take the lower for criminal that is successful so you know-- you tap into the system and you can see that there are rocket launchers somewhere onboard you're not entirely sure which side of the car because you don't know cars very well it's grizz leigh's thing you also know that there is a whole other aquatic form that this car can take there's a lot of code in there it talks about a salmon-mobile form you program a little bit more being the badass hacker that you are and you change the cd console to disperse some honey you can as a sun bear you know there are you lift open the console and there is a whole bar set up this is a very classy-- you can there is enough and it's handy enough they know that you all are bears on the go these have little lids they're little jars that you can fill to-go cups you each have an extra dose of honey on you you now have two after about an hour or so of travel with the turbo mode of the 00 salmon-- the amazing country tunes of grizz leigh bear keeping you entertained along the way in the distance you see stilben as you come around the hilly mountain road and-- where am i yeah you're in stilben that's about it it's a very swampy town you went through these swampy lands as you got there it is a bigger town but i wouldn't call it necessarily well-to-do it's humble a lot of wooden cabins and it's very much a seaside swamp town there is a stable you can go to a stable or there's some flat lands on the outside of the town in the swampy area if you want to try it you drive up on the stable and there's a few stable hands going in and out they seem pretty distracted at the moment and you go around the back way and there is a stall that's what stables are called right there's a stall facing backwards to the property so there's a wall between the building that they do business at is and-- yeah the farm-y office yeah you're taking your penis car through the back okay go ahead and-- yeah you pop open the glove compartment you see some daytime opera gloves a user's manual for the car and insurance papers you very slowly-- -- back into the stall you said you guys wanted to try and conceal it go ahead and roll for bear it's such a slippery car you're not used to it it's such a rounded shape the hay keeps sliding off of it you're not necessarily frustrated yet i would say roll for criminal as the brains i'd say you can-- as the brains i was going to say you roll with advantage yes you start peeking into a few of the stalls next and you do see a big burlap canvas sheeting that they use to mat down the area and you rip it up there's a few at the closer ones i imagine two rows of stables it looks like it's a very slow time they've got maybe two horses right now in the stable not a lot (whinnies) (snorts) they flick their tail the horse turns and shows you its ass lifts its tail how horses do that tova leads you all out you-- okay roll for criminal hmm roll for-- i don't know yeah roll for criminal to see if you notice anybody okay you see a few kiosks running like a farmers stand in the distance it is starting to become that sunset-y hour like around 500 it seems like people are starting to pack up people are a little distracted heading home from work dani and yeah it sucks man mm-hmm okay (laughs) go ahead and roll for criminal to see if you're making a convincing approach yes you can then who wants to roll to try and scout the sunset stride it's the driver go ahead oh no okay ooh okay right as grizz leigh is like i think i see a sign that says the sunset stride you hear a guard go hey hey is that-- are those raccoons oh shit we got bears i think we got bears he takes off running okay you're a honey badger so you have carnage roll twice and roll for bear as he's running you miss completely and you fly past him and he goes ah he goes aww they've gotten in the trash again he starts going get kicking at you she is currently acting as a distraction and the rest of you guys-- you guys all sneak around-- roll again for bear as you try to escape-- roll for criminal as you try to escape yeah he goes (cry of effort) and punts you you go flying into the bushes unfortunately this is a little frustrating and you move a point from criminal into bear the distraction did more or less work and he has run off you are now alone it's a pretty slow night in the sunset stride you see a few people at a two-seater in the corner you see another group at a booth over here a few people playing poker and behind the bar is a woman named miss honey penny she's dressed like a typical barmaid she's got shelf boob going on she's trying to go for those tips she's got a nice darker complexion with rich brunette hair that she has piled up in a big messy bun on the top of her head to get it out of her face she looks over at you guys has that look of awareness and goes a round on the bar and starts pouring up shots everyone goes woo okay you're going to go around towards the back cool you slip out you go around you see a cellar stockroom and there is a little small cramped back door entryway right as you go to open it she comes over and cracks the door it has she is human but you know that she shares similar talents to you depending on certain full moons and moisture in the air we've bonded in the past over her that's what we call it come inside she ushers you all inside you're all sitting around cases of wine and there's a few standing kegs and wine barrels that you all prop yourself up on i'm assuming you guys are in town because of the balootonium problem well i mean see things every night here in stilben but there has been one guy that's been calling attention to everybody in town he goes by the name of crispin glover (laughter) very tall very thin he's got this greasy slicked back black hair a little goofy a little weird he seems really convinced on letting people know he's crispin glover i think he thinks we're supposed to know who he is i think he's behind a lot of this he seemed like just another whacko that stumbled in the bar and then one night after a few drinks he started rambling about some pack of bears that was harassing him he is a human he is wearing-- not that i'm aware of i mean he wears this really weird black suit this black-on-black suit all that time it's like he's always in black suits he tends to be alone although i've seen him look over his shoulder thinking that maybe he's been followed i honestly didn't think anything of it similar dis-ease and discomfort they seemed to be driven crazy by his mysterious presence not because i think they find him attractive but because they want to know genuinely why he keeps telling them that he's crispin glover hmm like very expensive cologne that i've never smelled before it smells chemical-y it's nothing i've really ever smelled before hmm if i knew what aerosols were i would think that there might be some of this in that yeah i think i have but i have been unaware that is actually an interesting point that i never thought about before he did have a strange odor but if he had balootonium on him at the time i was unaware but yeah now that you mention it i'd say it's highly likely yeah he's been spending a lot of times at the docks he has this strange looking boat it looks very high-tech a lot of steam and copper-powered motors that i've never really seen he's been prepping it for the last few days i don't know where he's going but-- at the docks it is nearby honestly i could probably stick my head out of this window and throw a penny and hit it you're pretty close i do have a lot of pennies how did you know does she do this what is it that she does not that i'm aware of i don't know he's been rambling about this pack of bears so as soon as i heard that i thought it was potentially linked to the bear acuda he might be an informant of hattori bongo's i'm not sure that was my first thought he seems like he got caught up in something that he didn't necessarily understand and now he's stuck in a crappy situation it's got coppery implements on it it's not a penis color no but it looks like it was a steel that they tried to paint but it didn't necessarily take it seems like it's been on the water a little bit i don't know thank you guys good luck it's good asking she does-- (excited exclamations) you know i get it stocked wait is that the mcfuzz's famous fudge man i would love some it feels a little awkward that's actually really good (sighs) if you get into trouble you know where to find me yeah here until the bar closes probably six o'clock by now there is i'll let you out this back way if you hang a right follow the trash line it'll pop you right back out the back way where the sewers go got a few empty burlap sacks mm-hmm beggars do i think well here i was going to throw it away anyway hmm-- huh she handed you two we'll say two sacks two leftover grain sacks from you no i don't think i do i'm sorry she throws her barmaid's wipey-thing you must be the hacker i used to do that a little bit back in my days at the high bear nation i miss it good days good days yeah you'll do okay you're fine honestly i feel like the more human you look in this town the weirder you're going to stand out there's some weird people who come through here just act like a crazy homeless guy and no one will pay any attention it was pretty good actually no you'll see a gutter follow the gutter full of shit dumps right into the ocean that's why you make a damn good agent cheers honeys you know where to find me honey penny lets you out she leans does a double-take makes sure that the coast is clear and lets you all slip out in the back alley you do find a shit gutter where everyone is dumping from their buildings sliding out yeah very medieval a lot of falling poo it seems to do this downhill grade and pops out right behind the docks there's probably about half a dozen boats right now there's a couple that are up close it looks like fishermen coming back unloading their supplies yes there are fish there's a couple boats that look inactive like they've been there for a little bit and no one's really used them there's one boat that looks a little bit more well-to-do like it's more of a socializing and luxury boat than a utility boat and then you do see one other boat that has the copper detailing and pipes coming out the back of it it's a little bit tinier it's got a pointed front it's different than a boat you've ever really seen before the copper one is actually separated and off at the very end there are there's a lot of shipping containers scattered all along the first crate you see once again a lot of grains a lot of fruits looks like it was a general food supply that's been coming from-- not a lot of fruits that you recognize a little bit more exotic tropical fruits the other one looks like it has a lot of a sulfuric-- you actually are familiar with this because you have seen it before based on being in the high bear nation it is gunpowder okay roll for bear oh wait no you're the thief sorry roll for thief twice roll twice take the lowest for criminal yes you think you can break a weak point in the cross-braces and you punch the shit out of this crate you hear a little bit of a crack and the wood does not move and your partners think-- they look a little distressed you can try roll twice take the lowest oh the rest of you you first see clair do it and then you see drew-- seemingly trying to follow the person before her-- also punch and crack the shit out of your knuckles unfortunately you're starting to get a little frustrated at this so if each of you will move one point from criminal to bear pretty heavy you don't see anybody inside but you do see through the boat a complex steam engine contraption it looks a little similar to what you have and you also see one small medium-sized crate shoebox-sized crate and a few other satchels you don't see anybody yet but at this point when you are looking at the boat tova your globear positioning system (slow beeping) as you look at it you see a little red tracker that is moving across the screen and towards the docks towards the boat that you are looking at it does sure enough as you type in crispin glover and it goes (fast beeping) you look through the crates and you see a tall thin man in a dark black suit pass through the crates he's carrying another satchel and looking a little hasty through the gap in the crates he's not moving physically through the crates he is not incorporeal he just passes by them he has a little satchel and he looks harried yes he goes over to the boat the steam-looking one and he starts throwing stuff in okay he doesn't seem to notice you he's hunched over he turns and he goes who's there he rubs his eyes it's getting a little dark yeah are you here to help me he moves a little closer roll for face he gets a little bit closer and goes oh no more bears he turns and he runs and he jumps in the speedboat okay you do get a little frustrated at this move one point from criminal to bear yep he jumps in the boat and is turning it on roll for bear as you chase after him mary noelle and okay he feels you grab by the collar and he doesn't care he steps on the gas and he takes off roll for bear just one this time unfortunately you go and you're right behind tova and as you make a leap for it the boat goes right out from under you it's a lot faster than you anticipated and none of you have ever seen a boat this fast let's roll for bear bear to throw i don't know it goes a little bit wild it doesn't land in the water but it does hit the ground hopefully it's okay you would know from hacking that the 00 salmon has an auto-drive ability that will come to you when summoned she would have to help you you pull out the key fob sure enough (bubbling) (motor revving) it pulls up into the water and it is in full salmon mode it is in the water it looks kind of like a fish but also kind of like a car but also kind of like a boat but also still kind of like a penis you actually already know the hot button for this if you hit forward on that shift you will get max speed okay you guys all pile in you see tova and crispin glover probably about 500 feet ahead of you and they are getting away he is driving this boat you've got him in a chokehold and he's doing one of these maneuvers he's swerving back and forth it is actually causing him to veer off-path to give these guys time to catch up sure roll for your terrify ability with advantage oh no unfortunately you are getting a little frustrated that this situation is happening you need to move a point into bear away from criminal okay you hit that green turbo button and (revving) the fish comes up the front end of it out of the water and it's skipping on the waves a little bit you are gaining pretty close to crispin glover i'd say you're probably only 20 feet behind him now okay so you're readying give me a driver roll to see if you can get close enough for the maven to jump on you do it with advantage you succeed you see what the maven is trying to do you've pulled this cool train jump situation before grizz pulls around you see how crispin is bobbing and weaving and you time it just right you pull up beside him right as he's pulling and you guys are boom right next to each other roll for bear are you serious the maven misses you get the boat a little bit and you fly off the back and you catch a rope you are now flying off of the back of crispin glover's speedboat okay roll for bear bear do bears ski (cheering) the maven is successfully skiing it was a good plan you get to move a point from bear back into criminal what are the rest of you all doing yes roll for hacker roll twice take the lowest you have three is three what you have in your criminal points you succeed (revving) it takes off and you are now in front of crispin glover and he's having a hard time getting around you guys you are successfully cutting him off roll for bear you're a black bear you're good at climbing right roll twice you succeeded this is your specialty you were an olympic climber back in the day you climb up on that rope and you are now on the back of the boat you see tova having him in a headlock okay roll for bear again he hits a wave and you bounce and you get thrown into the back of the seat okay you successfully do so you already rolled really well on that you start knocking him and turning him around a little bit he's looking really freaked out roll twice because you have advantage being the muscle she is rolling yes have you seen that youtube video of the monkey that throws the raccoon and the raccoon does that you take clair she flies clair you smack right across crispin glover's face your belly is wrapped around his head roll for carnage two take the better option yes you start clawing at his eyes he's screaming bloody murder you get his right eye and gouge it completely out you can keep the eye yeah about that time he recognizes that things are going poorly and he goes (groaning) and he hits a button on the dashboard that's all now what he's still fighting clair after he pushed the button it is he has pretty much come to a complete stop okay he is completely halted he is completely stopped there is a moment of silence luckily the boats are right next to each other and they are not moving so you easily climb over into the boat okay you try and hack into his speedboat roll for hacker take the lower one ooh you successfully hack into his boat this code looks really familiar you've already seen this code once you recognize it from the 00 salmon what you also recognize is that this car has a distress beacon on it as you realize this as you look at the globear positioning system you see (beeping) you see four little signals start coming your way okay you find the shoebox you try and open it it is locked okay you reach over into the console and you hit the button and boof a swarm of bees erupts you successfully come over you've got the satchels you've got the box you're still around crispin glover's head as you look up and as you look up and you're still distracted but you still see as well you see four other speedboats coming towards you breaking the horizon he goes ah no why he starts freaking the fuck out he's not having a good day he's already stopped he is in a swarm of bees with one eye not knowing what's happening you all pile into the salmon you take off you bust forward deeper into the ocean you see four speedboats coming right at you you hit maximum speed trying to blow right past them you all have guns and it does have a rocket launcher if you hit forward on that black shift button which you do it goes (whooshing) from the front headlights it flips open and two warheads come flying out they hit two of the boats in the distance they go flying you see an explosion parts go flying everywhere oil slicks in the ocean you see the two other boats veer away from this to try and avoid it as you guys are now ahead of them the two boats do a big 180 and are now on your tail as they are chasing you all in the satchel is a bunch of random knick knacks that look like he's picked up trash off of the street yeah just super weird there is a folded note and another black suit it's almost a bug-out bag okay you know english a little bit what you get-- yes you know how to put the food safety hazards and the ingredients on the sides of boxes from that knowledge what you glean this letter looks like scrawlings from a madman looks like there were coordinates and algorithms and equations that look like he was trying to figure something out as you turn a page you see a diary entry and it talked about him being an interdimensional being (gasping) then he says this happens to me all the time i get sucked into weird realms and people keep saying i'm an actor and no one wants to listen to me when i say i'm stuck in a creative landscape they think i'm some sort of weird creative genius i'm not with any side i just want to get out of this fantasy realm get me out i'm just trying to avoid the bears it goes on and it talked about more ramblings about how he's being stalked by bears then he says he can't believe that there would be such a dextrous group of bears known as the high bear nation and that they promised him some balootonium and said that if properly used it could get him back to his home realm he is-- there is balootonium in the shoebox you are still heading deep into the ocean and there are still boats as you guys are all having this sudden crisis of morality and realization you can see as you look-- you can't see much features but they do appear to be two bear-type individuals in very nice black suits (beeping) you've already seen this a pod a clear glass bubble comes up over top of your convertible top (submersion sounds) you go underwater a little thing pops up on the console and says five minutes of oxygen remaining five minutes of oxygen not too deep if you look up you can still see a little bit of daylight make a criminal check as you look around there was a beach drew you press your polar bear face against and being a polar bear you are very adept at seeing underwater as grizz is turning around and you look out the front towards the direction you guys were actually heading you see some scaffolding poles like a structure is actually not too far ahead of you all grizz you turn and slowly start-- you're not trying to disturb the water and let your presence known as you get closer you do see-- --these support beams start making themselves a little bit more clear and as you get closer beep-beep beep-beep the gps system has more little tracking dots pop up and it looks like it's coming from this structure very slowly start to ascend as you get closer you let the little bubble crest a little bit but you're not coming all the way up as you look up you all see cresting the waterline the top of this building it is a giant industrial complex it is an offshore military base and weapons laboratory and at the top you see a big sign marking the entire building that simply says ripley it doesn't but that is something we should totally submit to the high bear nation to have implemented and that is where we're going to take a break you pop it open a little bit and you get air yeah you're fine you're fine you don't die we're back and you all suffocated thank you guys for joining us all right as always we are going to take a quick ten-minute break we bears will bear all when we return i didn't have anything left that's all i got all right we will be right back [break] you can go under it's a full on off-shore compound if you go underneath there's a little bit of room that you can pull right under and you'd be underneath the compound (revving) flashback (warbling) you feel the scent of the alcohol burning your nostrils cold sweat of the glass glass was slippery speaking of the sweat on the glass reminiscing on these wonderful thoughts you calm your minds you're reminded of the mission that you're on its importance and that it doesn't matter who sent you on this mission it is what you do during the mission that defines the mission thank you you can all choose if you would like to move a point from bear into criminal because of that flashback you're missing a point you're underneath and you can see it's on stilts above the ocean and you look up and it's pretty much industrial riveted steel flooring that you see looks pretty practical you do see a hatch not far that appears to be locked (beeping) you can't really tell it's this cluster right over top of you you type in clair mcfuzz and it goes (beeping) and points over at her pretty much in the same place but it singles out one of the blips you can try yeah (beeping) it is in the cluster a little bit away and in a corner you see two water portways that are a little bit open it looks like the floor can basically move and be sectioned out and make space for boats to come in and park you see a ton of crates looks like general stock and supply you see one guard one bear in a suit standing near the edge of the wall a door that he is guarding you scutter up and you use the half-dome that's still there from when it's in salmon submarine mode right on your tippy-toes and you start trying to pick to lock roll twice roll for criminal while they're bickering and they're going back and forth you quietly get up there with your comb and your fork that you found and a hatch opens up clair you feel pretty good about that so you get to move a point from bear to criminal you all scutter up the side of this hatch door you have a few shipping crates and containers that are blocking your way you all stealthily crawl up peak around the corner you see a guard maybe ten feet facing away from you he is a bear in a suit you guys are peaking around the corner he's facing sideways yeah definitely it's the bloop bloop bloop bloop little clair on top you're a sleek black bear and you've just come up from a beachy speedboat mission your fur is a little glisteny dripping you've got your hat which spills a little water as you peek around the corner he turns and goes uh wipes his cheek you must be one of our foreign transfers you new here to the ripley outpost with the high bear nation what's your name sorry i'm not good with foreign languages i'm just going to butcher it you forgive me if i-- can i call you b well i'm grylls bear grylls put a bag over my head oh do you want to just kiss me without the bag okay roll for face twice because you have advantage for this one (cheering) he's starting to lean forward and he goes do you-- should i-- right as he's doing this boof roll twice for muscle (cheering) you could absolutely try to do that you all need to take a point in criminal because that was going quite well for you from bear to criminal sorry these two ladies drew and the midnight maven grizz you look over and you do find an empty crate that looks like with assistance you could push the lid off and throw this guy in together it's pretty easy falls right over (gurgling) you go over to the door simple steel door but it does have a latch lock with a little mechanical techy maybe enchanted key lock you see a long hallway that stretches down it looks like two stairs descending on either side and it looks like another room adjacent to this doorway you see a couple of bears on the other side in the room that is adjacent to this one you don't see anyone in the hallway they are bears in suits you see two of them it looks like there is some sort of paw print indentation it looks like there's also a latch that opens up and that you can enter a code if you-- well this has a thing and you code if you can't do this you can override it with a code if that makes sense you know those latchy things right so you can-- you know what amazingly you hold the eyeball in front of the scanner one side-- it looks like it's trying it looks like he did have clearance but he was not cleared for a single eye entry he needs both eyes okay i'm into it roll twice take the lowest natural one sure enough like magic-- tick kaboof the reverberations hum in the indentations of the paw print that was a successful plan you get to move a point from bear to criminal you peek around the door three heads on one side three on the other looking down hallways and you see those stairways that clair saw through the glasses and another door directly across the way this one does not appear to be locked but you do know that there two guards on the other side you see that he is in a corner but appears behind you you can't necessarily tell since the gps is a birds-eye view what level he is on but he does not appear to be in the room in front of you you can roll for brains yeah absolutely just peeking up and around the staircase to your right you can see that it looks like it's a dead end there is another room this side and this side but there doesn't appear to be a hallway that goes further when you peek around the stairs to the left it keeps going and loops around okay you head up the stairs and you go around the corner as you head up there is a glass door with glass windowing that looks like it opens up into a very large laboratory room there does appear to be a locked vault door directly to your left like a locked storage room or a locked-- you know how banks will have a locked information type of situ-- yeah-- off to the side one glass door with glass windows and you can see-- there does not appear to be anybody inside when you look at your globear positioning system you do see one flashing beacon from deep inside he looks to be in the big laboratory room it's dark you can see it looks like half the lights are on towards the front of the room but the room goes pretty far back and falls in shadow and you can't see past it you only see one beacon in the room yes you assume so there is a door to get into the lab like once again those clear glass hospital doors almost it has a simple lock on it similar to what you guys have already discovered since you've already hacked the one downstairs you already know the code to get into this one so this one has already been unlocked yeah you're going to peek through the glass roll for criminal just once your bear breath is fogging-- you're like guys i think they have a fogging system you don't know you can roll for bear you do catch faint wafts of this highly radioactive honey compound that's a little sweet but a little-- it burns your nostrils you can just tell it's coming from the lab technically a condensed crystallized form of honey that's highly explosive yes you also confirm that you can sense a strong amount of balootonium coming from the laboratory you see documents high priority files a few more weapons you see sitting on one of the shelves something that looks useful yes it's a little less awkward than the first time yeah the leader has spoken clair you walk up to the vault you see an old-fashioned combination lock in front of you you roll two dice yeah okay it takes a little bit but you put your ear up to it your keen honey badger hearing hears the clicks and the tumblers as you turn it over (click) it is unlocked you go to turn the wheel-- you're too weak this is the vault roll for muscle (door opening) your polar bear biceps turn it with ease and then you push but it still might be a team effort you all (grunting) all your little bear paws skitter against the steel floor but it opens (sighing) all right tova you immediately go and you find-- grizz leigh you see a small crate got padding in it it's got three little egg-shaped pods in it bearah your sun bear keen honey-scent spotting nose looks down and finds a small vial filled with honey although it is a dark blackish purplish ichor-like color none of you are quite sure what it does mm-hmm okay roll for criminal also all who participated-- which was i guess you two-- in cracking the vault i was going to say move a point from bear to criminal you move a point back yes sorry was going to say that earlier and then things got going so yeah if anyone wants to eat honey and move a point from criminal to bear you can okay unfortunately you don't really know what you're looking at you pass it over to tova tova roll for brains with advantage you definitely succeed you look and you see blueprints inventory receipts correspondence back and forth they all seem to be building some sort of weapon like a warhead like a bomb and there have been a few iterations of it they're testing it out you also see blueprints for the 00 salmon as well as blueprints for crispin glover's boat as well as guns a few other things there are a few sign off signatures that look like someone needed to give approval for some of these shipments and they all seem to be under bearsley nothing coming up for paddington nothing coming up for ripley same place as bearsley you're all totally armed you exit the vault you peek around the little pocket hallway that it's in and there right before you to your left is the door to the laboratory it is already unlocked because you already hacked the system you all can go right in you all push on the door (intones battle without honor or humanity) you flip your hair you have a nice flying-v formation grizz tova-- the midnight maven clair mcfuzz drew bearymoore and bearah pawcett you see before you a vast open room few consoles on the side walls flashing lights leds creating a dimly lit glow in a stark interior alone in the center of the room you see a platform suspended from the ceiling by thick industrial cables on this platform you see a semi-translucent cylindrical device emanating a faint glow of its own with a mess of wiring protruding from its center as you peek a little closer your eyes adjust to the darkness you see through its translucent body pulsating marbles of sheer energy this is a metric fuck ton of balootonium and it is rigged to blow you see a little screen but it appears to be dark you see a small light just blue nothing much to it at the moment take a moment you look down your globear positioning system is the only sound in the room the (beeping) emerging from the shadows once again is bearsley but this time he is in a giant mech suit with a strap across it engraved in steel lettering says the ripley p5000 he says-- that's a lot of pee he says hello honeys surprised to see me yeah you know i thought you guys might figure it out no i just wanted you all to realize how much i do around here and how underappreciated i have been for years i thought you guys would be more intimidated by this all right look i have been a puppet for paddington for years i'm basically his glorified assistant i'm the brains of the entire operation and what do i get it's just 'hello bearsley hi bearsley see you later 'bearsley while we go on an amazing adventure' it should be me running this organization i did it's all under paddington and he will never appreciate me that's why i started developing the balootonium using the laboratory funds and dispersing it across the entire continent i want you all to come and work for me i want the organization not under paddington it belongs to me yeah a couple times i can't tell you that i'm sorry i'm under a contract and i deeply respect contracts it's the only thing that i really hold of value look you guys don't know what it's been like okay and i know the source to all the balootonium and how much balootonium is out there you know this felt like every other bad guy situation in every other story so i thought it would hold different well you're all confusing me this is what i'm talking about he goes (boop) and hits a button he hits another button on his mech suit and he goes figure this out and then we'll see who's the smartest honeys he jet packs through a trapdoor in the roof and then-- since you have a hacker in your group i will allow you one re-spin so you have to pull 12-- if more than three marbles fall a 60 second timer starts six you're halfway there you're good four more which one grizz leigh nice green i think two more (counting) eleven twelve (powering down) it completely turns off i can't believe that that actually-- matt and i play-tested that ten times and it never went that well you with a combined team-- thank you with a combined team effort you all manage to successfully defuse the bomb i will allow you if you want to move a point from bear to criminal you can but you do not have to because i remember so well it was pretty good it was pretty fucking amazing i'm not going to lie he went through the roof in a jetpack power suit you guys do look up and the trap door is still open maven with your climb ability you can see a pole that goes about halfway and you could get a detachable ladder to drop about halfway down to climb up to the roof if you would like you get advantage for your bear stat absolutely you with no problem do that bear climb like up a tree just like this you manage to hold on and you reach over flip open a latch there is a ladder to the roof you guys all ascend up and you see that you are in the middle of the ocean pretty much in the middle of nowhere you can barely see land it goes vroom and you look over the edge and you can look down and you do see that it is right below you but it does not fly three stories as you say that he flies up in his jet pack that he's trying to control okay so you all aim your guns all three of you including-- you've got a gun too you've got your grenades going maven you put your rifle on the edge of grizz leigh's shoulder and use it for balance and you're going to blow that gun using that one last shot see what you can do he's kind of (zooming) so roll for criminal it goes wide the gun explodes it burns the edge of your hand as it backfires a little fur singes on all of you the shot goes wide and unfortunately misses he goes (manic laughing) about this time jetpacks don't hold a lot of fuel really only like 30 seconds' worth and he did not gauge this well he duck flails on the edge you can bees the bees fly up they are swarming in a planned hive mind type of formation you want them to go after bearsley he is completely surrounded by bees he starts screaming oh why did i install that feature i was being funny you're on the roof the car's below you he's on the roof in front of you all in his power suit like a turtle a little stuck it's instantaneous yes yes it's a magic grenade it's unpacked he's currently being stung repeatedly by a swarm of bees yes he's in front of you guys oh god it hurts so bad oh god why make it stop please sure the bees eventually disperse he in his mech suit sits up grizz leigh as the driver you do recognize a lot of this mechanical contraption and if you want to try and get him out you can probably do that pretty easily okay okay each one of you one takes an arm one takes the other arm half of you takes the legs he's completely restrained okay i'm cooperating he definitely has some pretty dangerous things attached to this some more of those homing missiles that you guys had on the 00 salmon but nothing that seems like it will explode when you take it off sure yes he is still locked in though so you'll need to get him out of that nice yes yes with that allen wrench you know this equipment pretty well you easily get him out yes you know i'm really sorry girls i thought-- i'm really sorry very respectable agents you're right i was wrong and i thought that i had to do something extravagant and cruel to garnish your respect and your attention i hope you know that my actions today don't change the way i feel about you grizz you're right i definitely tried to kill you yeah i convinced myself yeah you're right no i'm not saying i'm innocent at all i lost it a little bit you see ladies i've been at the high bear nation for ten years that's the second time slippy system i guess i always felt like i'd always be a number two yeah he honestly i didn't expect i didn't foresee a man's murder that actually-- he's probably dead yeah he did keep saying he was an interdimensional being i just thought he was a crazy homeless guy you guys don't-- okay you put another sack over him halfway down he's a tiny bear man gets a little-- okay i'm sorry okay you guys take him your proof your treasure everything you've got the documents you all get back in the 00 salmon you head back to stilben drive across land back to the headquarters of the high bear nation in shadowbear-- shadebarrow it's a real place too many puns shadowbear is their borough in shadebarrow you report back paddington hears of your deeds you get pulled in well thank you honeys hello honeys i am saddened to hear of this treachery from bearsley never thought it could come from one of our own at the high bear nation absolutely who oh you mean that wonderful woman that we've been making a trade deal with i feel like that relationship has gone quite well how did you like your ripley 00 salmon notes on color got it anyway i appreciate you all coming to aid for the high bear nation i believe bearsley should take a little bit of a leave of absence on my account therefore i shall need a new number two tova (cheering) if you would like the position i would love to meet with you face to face 30 more seconds down wrap up the epilogue quicker your revelry will blow us all up please don't anyway you all have been granted raises and higher status at the high bear nation titles of which i did not make up but will come up with later who are you who's that talking is she authorized you simply see wires and speakers tova i will be in contact for our face to face meeting in the meantime thank you honeys it has been a pleasure as tova and grizz leigh have their conversation about (singing) being the best you can be b plus that is the end of tonight's episode of honey heist 3 tova's honeys and the adventures of the agents of the high bear nation thank you (nostalgic screaming) wasn't that a great game kerplunk kerplunk when i was trying to remember what this was called i was like marble stick ball drop game into google and it was like oh kerplunk no that is the opposite basically there were six red ones eight yellow ones and ten green ones the red ones were the base but in a fucked up way by pulling them all up front-- if you pulled from the top bottom then the red ones would have been basically the last remaining i spent way too long putting the red ones very strategically it was fascinating hearing the are they the most important or the least important i don't know bears with sticks you're elite agents no you guys actually stayed pretty balanced oh go full bear i was deeply interested how that was going to go it's kind of amazing you could have just talked to us i was like bad guy archetype complaining about power being second in charge like no that's good that's good well goodnight everybody thank you all for joining me and maybe next time on the prequel i don't know i'm making this up as i go don't quote me on this but we'll see you next time
