headed there she fell down the stairs you guys i catch up to her a little bit hey avantika weird question how much do you know-- how do you know how to give a certain amount to avantika sorry the plank king freudian slip it's very intense so it's less like a government and more of a union that you buy into like a union with a dictator hmm do you ever think you could make a good union leader huh no who needs aspirations i would love for you to tell me about it someday deal might as well go to the pub first drink's on her (knowing laugh) do it i'm the worst influence i'm going to say do it yes what's avantika doing pirates is that blues traveler go to trader sam's caduceus how much is salt worth to you like on a scale of money to nothing sure he's bruce wayne caduceus wayne caduce wayne sorry excuse me sorry so avantika what's next for the squalleater what what did she say haven't heard-- didn't expect this-- what i immediately grab my purse and hold onto it the thing i imagine most adventurers have a little coin satchel no not a dolce & gabbana no not a kate spade no there was a discussion it's coming yeah or sophie it's always a sophie if there's not 12 people that pop out behind this curtain i'm going to be disappointed her lantern light yeah i heard something about a ring and treasure in her eyes 48 hours ooh night walk oh i forgot good night it feels pretty public i need to pee anyone know where the bathroom is i was already on it i respond back in halfling mm-hmm jester do you have a pen and paper i could borrow sorry got caught in a language loop do you have any pencil and paper or pen and ink just like a scrap thank you i scribble meet in the alley on the piece of paper is there an alley i'm assuming there's an alley behind this meet in the back alley to be specific will you go with me to the ladies' room so we can powder our noses together let's go powder as i walk out i shake alice's hand say nice to meet you and palm her the piece of paper that's folded very tightly give her a wink and walk off i go-- and i walk out she'll read it right let's go around to the side of the building we are a hundred percent going to take a shit in the alley i go towards the back alley i show nott where to take a shit i wait either for the rest of my friends or for alice to eventually read the damn thing-- allison it works half of the time it's super awesome i just want to figure out what her beef is with avantika maybe she can be our key-- yeah we can get information from her first we don't have to necessarily always give information upfront to get information and we can always lie i am yeah i feel like that's slightly underhanded i don't break eye contact sam and all right (sneezes) matt and i'm sorry or just saving your life nott will you stand guard now because now i have to take a shit it's been that long two more minutes okay what was your question all right let's go night walk night hike i've got 50 gold on that (whispering) mermaids night hike we're all here don't worry about it we're looking for fresh air gauge it as it comes it is we should get a wig for the judge like the plank king has yeah travis and just throwing it out there yeah who's watching this is the revelry she's kind of like a tiffany that makes it clear we call it the-- the apricot wait is the apricot this or is the apricot the tiny tiffany ship it's this okay holy shit i'm keeping an eye open for every suspicious-looking asshole it feels like a farmer's market it feels like certain people sell things whenever they got them okay do you have a powerpoint mm-hmm well i think it's less about getting off this island without tiffany and more about getting to that shipwreck first before her bitch well she's not currently at her ship i'm assuming a lot of her valuable information is locked away in her captain's quarters somewhere on tiffany's ship if we can get the information to the next apricot tree then do we need tiffany anymore how far that's a lot of feet so many feet look if i've learned anything about important people it's that they can't resist putting shit down on paper i guarantee you there's something in her office do we have credentials do we have like badges like beep-beep oh can you no i want to get something tusktooth so many nicknames personally i feel more comfortable with honda controlling the supply of apricots than tiffany the tree we just came from or the tree that we're going to fuck asking tiffany any questions we break into breakfast at tiffany's and get the information that we need eyy this is my specialty no comment i plead the fifth i think to get in yeah also you said there was a balcony right was there a door to the balcony do you think that would be locked or to avantika i mean tiffany fuck we were doing so well who's here do we need to have honda distract tiffany can we not do this right now while she's theoretically sleeping that's true he could be accountable for sure busy we could have this guy with frumpkin making sure that they're busy if you're comfortable with that you don't have a lot of a choice this is my forte man okay but if i'm with the queen then what does it matter tiffany i could take the-- that's a good point fuck how are you going to get off the boat what are me and cad doing cad can you go with honda you have to be nearby can we how about this caleb and caduceus and fjord you're one team you have frumpkin watch fjord you give me the word when it's good to go i'll deliver that to nott and jessie they go-- i'll give you the signal you guys go i'll be nearby i'll distract any guards if need be with my feminine wiles and then you let me know if there's any emergency-- then i will have no means to communicate with anybody else but you will actually that's a good point how far away is the bloated cup from the boat oh that's amazing cool perfect good it might be our downfall but it's great okay so i'll try and be within eyeshot of the bloated cup within eyeshot of you oh he's been in my--- sorry i don't-- to get out here i slip caduceus a few of those firecrackers that i have how long will that take break this is either the best plan or the worst plan it's a great plan i turn my cloak inside-out to the inconspicuous side and case towards the docks and start casing the area for revelry that are guarding the area or potentially a good place for them to do the thing 13 do i see anything that looks like it could be a potentially good area for them to cast a spell without being noticed okay i block around as to not look like it's going the same way that i just came from and catch back up with these two with the detectives all right there's two guards casing the dock and two of avantika's-- tiffany's people on the ship it looks pretty open we might want to find an alternative for you guys to not be noticed as you do the crazy magic thing it's super open two guards guarding the dock and two people on the deck of tiffany's ship to then bamf over our quarters in the-- okay you guys are going to have to talk to guards and convince yourself on the way in and you will be noticed we're talking about two different things here there are two guards guarding the docks there are two people on the ship of avantika's bo-- of tiffany's boat on the de-- you get what i'm saying the deck of the ship of the boat if you all want to just walk on to your quarters you will have two guards and two of our crew members who will see you walk on we hide somewhere and we're never seen at all and you'll bamf in unless you disguise yourself as tiffany now then i would say we find a hidden place potentially in our private quarters in the bloated cup that you bamf into he said it was within 300 i will be nearby near the docks signal if you need me good yeah for the deception someone do that before they leave and we all go our respective ways i go all right listen rich people love to have safes but they love to hide stuff in the walls of safes like false bottoms in drawers stuff like that false backs to safes so even if you get in and you think you find everything double- and triple-check all right they love to write shit down i'm telling you it's there thanks was she not complimenting me just go steal from rich people can't hear from the blood pumping in his ears i'm on my way towards the docks yas queen yas you're staying in between i'm heading a little bit further the daisy chain so you guys to beau to caleb to cad to fjord i can hear you i have responded to this message fuck yes i signal to caleb that they've made it on the ship what what would investigation have been but you're a badass rogue come on oh my god you're lucky no i'm daisy chaining to it i give you a signal no me we already went through this the daisy chain i wander like a drunkard past caleb and i go oh so distracting like i need distractions while he is being a creepo i go over to the two guards on the dock this drunk piece of shit over here he tried to attack me so guy who was left that guy is an asshole and what's with that guy that just got stabbed i feel very unsafe no i'm just saying-- he tried to i think rob me i thought as a pirate that i had immunity to that i don't know i'm just trying-- actually technically i'm new great to meet you sure let's go you're fucking welcome go go go go go why did i get arrested you shot me i say sup waynen i'm with avantika's crew you can ask her if you want but i don't think you really want to pretty sure she's above your pay grade am i right great fucking intimidation nine that's right oh i'm sorry are you afraid i'm going to stub a toe in the middle of the night beau never does i just go oh fuck i just keep walking like i don't know who they are and i pass by them with a glance fuck you (laughter) not to the boat never to the boat you saw a lot of shit go down at the boat sup guys how was your night walk shh who's around who's really drunk though is there someone real drunk is anyone real drunk look real drunk in the tavern that was part of our crew part of the squalleater jesus that's a natural one oh sorry it's a four ten oh what's-his-name i sit down next to waldok with another drink and hand him a drink holy shit man i am so sorry we couldn't have been there to protect you from these attackers who's the other guy's name i'm sorry we couldn't have been there to protect you from zoen what a dick i mean we were here all night fucking trashed so-- if we had only been there 15 could've been better we were drunk here we kind of stagger a bit though look for invisible peoples in the room fucking fuck seven i look over his shoulder i know deep speech oh that's pretty awesome she is a bitch oh shit (gasp) yes yes it could it's got the apricot tree nah holy shit you got a book but you still get a book you still get a book though that's what i was saying mmm-hmm between apples and peaches i agree with that yeah we don't need to take that to the plank king if caleb knows the language why she could ford anything that we want-- forge she could forge-- we have her signature let's forge it i probably would have yeah so by the way i got tapped on the shoulder by the plank king he's looking for dirt on avantika i know totally mind-blowing i know you had no clue i don't think we need to do that i think we just drop it in the plank king's-- i think we copy the contents of the book that's what i'm saying we copy the contents of the book sure as long as you think it'll last there i will say the plank king offered me some good cash to rat out avantika he was literally asking for a snitch now-- no nothing about any of these people is honest i know what to sign just write it up and i'll sign it i'll simply sign it with how much to go with the package mm-hmm unless we want zero implications-- we need the mist no no no he's saying we send a cipher and a translated page with the entire book so that they can then take the time with their smart people to translate the rest of the book no he knows the cipher correct they'll be able to tell unless we do jester's hint where we mend a few pages and get rid of some ink so let's just do that and the rest of the plan stays the same break it'll wake us up so who's guarding caleb sam and yeah that's good what's that where is that (knocking continues) okay what are we going to do can we send frumpkin now with the package just send him now out the window go go go go go send it with the book gee i wonder oh my god where's the mistake i'm dying i've never felt more in trouble (gasp) holy shit the gauntlet has been thrown not next week eyy laura ho-ly dang i should have kept those jewels but we got the information we needed info is golden well the day after thanksgiving on friday is honey heist 3 tova's honeys on friday watch us as bears stealing honey instead of very invaluable books and jewels it felt like getting called into the principal's office you're like fuck
