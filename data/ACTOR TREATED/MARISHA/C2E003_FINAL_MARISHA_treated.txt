oh no he looks fine it's all in his head oh natural 20 24 i turn to jester and molly fucking-- we probably shouldn't kill crownsguard even if it's a zombie should we go after the toad i don't want to be a guard killer all right fine can i peek out and see the guard-zombies can i crawl out from under the tent and clear the gap with them and get up to them oh man i don't know what to do after jester trying to help me can i close the gap to this guy it's cool man is that fire still going okay with my initial attack as i run up can i take my staff and try and take them out at the knees just a sweep yeah that's what i'm going for that's not great nine shit i look at him and i say you fucking broke my stick i'm going to do an elbow to the face and then another punch with the staff still in my hand and do flurry of blows right i know i'm doing an elbow and a punch i'm just holding my staff two attacks right oh god this makes me so nervous that's good 19 for the first one oh and a natural one for the second eight what's in the tent thanks doesn't make me trust you any more less actually ooh shit that's awesome give him the multiplier okay back to the top i'm going to do with my two-handed i'm going to use my quarterstaff two-handed and come down and try and crack it over his head okay can i step over the dead guy sorry excuse me goddamn it fuck balls and shit 13 yeah fuck yeah you're so weirded out about it 11 points of damage i can hit again with my bonus right i'm still trying to figure this out right learning these combat abilities it's weird okay i'm going to be like ugh die i'm going to do a big roundhouse kick to his head that's good that's a 16 that's an unarmed strike okay eight points it's a two plus-- no wait i'm sorry six points i was looking at the wrong thing i go ugh molly do it beau goes who undid my work oh shit christ you have a six pack of donuts but you don't have a healer's kit in there and you're the cleric i'm confused well congratulations you're the cleric now i'll give it to her here it's a gift congratulations-on-you-being-in-a-new group gift i immediately drop down and start searching the guard we should hide the evidence i don't know was there nothing useful on the guard how well did the fire burn the other body did it do pretty well or-- i thought he was with you oh my god you are so speaking my language i grab the other body and start dragging it or at least its torso wait you were shooting shit out of your hands oh i start hooking up the horses yeah one is going to hook up to the wagon and i'll-- which wagon do we want to take yeah okay we better get $100000 from ford for that one we better fucking get that molly i appreciate you trying to rally the horses right now but i really think you should rest i take the reins ornna is there anything else that you can think of that could possibly help us like why this toad decided to freak out right now anything that comes to mind before we go chase after your mess oh god maybe we can at least find him stake him out and then we'll rest cats love toads we ran into those guards that were patrolling the lake-- hang on hang on i want to look around do i see any guards big dice don't fail natural 20 like an island it's far away on the horizon the little bump there's two figures on a boat about a hundred yards out i don't know it's hard to say do they seem distracted can i make anything else out maybe we can dump them backtrack with the cart and drop the cart back off i'm going to help jester try and clear the tracks while she positions bodies (disgusted noise) eight if we try and cover the wagon tracks as much as we can then follow the embankment and try and ride the horses and the cart along the water it'll hide our tracks as we move northward okay you understand towards us i think they're fishermen let's keep moving north do these silhouettes look proportionate to each other which way did the fisherman go i think we should keep heading away from the city right go ahead even if we find this thing if we rest camping out then we're not at the tavern i bet that's exactly where it is that's what i was going to say let's go back and raid the fire should we walk the cart off see where it goes i like that we go along the lake then off to the edge and then we're going to give the horse a slap and send him off past-- using the lake to hide tracks whack with the stick it's not great thanks travis thanks six correctly hit a horse 17 17 jester i think so yeah hold on she's naked do you want to get it or should i get it maybe i should get it why didn't you just come and get us when you were ready for us does that take you three hours love it it's my favorite i was waiting for it the best day ever she's not your sister anymore should we talk

know if you unintentionally dodged the question last time or if you didn't hear me but you never exactly told us how the circus creates and writes their performance acts oh so you did hear me though just clarifying you bring your own narrative did toya and kylre come together with their act they came separate that's what they told you you guys are super easy to lie to no offense or anything they lied to them which means-- you never noticed toya acting weird you were never like oh this is a strange-- yeah but there's a difference between quirky weird and oh i think this person's life force is being siphoned away from them weird then why were you with the carnival (groaning) let's go find the damn toad ah shit oh my god why nope it's a one i don't know you know if it's binary one means--
