a direction that there might be people who have walked through that's a natural one first roll in the new studio it's a one we know nature is better at everything so it's impossible to tell if it's the same one well that's more narrow when it was going on the road was it going towards the direction we were going or were we following it yeah she also has a big old crushie on fjord why couldn't we hear anything censored video game blood and that blood was far away from our camp maybe they were just triggered by a sound that they heard and they went to go investigate it four d batteries it's

great start sorry i'm also trying to work on the manners thing the guy who actually got taken from us was helping me if shadycreek run is full of a bunch of criminals and you said you lived there for a while what were you doing there well that's pretty clear it's like a horror film the more you leave it up to your imagination the worse it is how about equal assurance that you don't fuck us over and you don't fuck us and we don't fuck you unless like you know it's been a while they're mobsters weird question have i heard about this group considering my background history my history changed

like i might die trying okay i did okay i do have a dagger and i put my goggles on safety first pull up the hood and i buckle myself up i take my scarf from around my waist and tie it around me for a facemask medicine it's higher just a straight check natural 20 ashly and i'm back got the sac now what do you have any more flasks or anything to put it in if we poke-- if you have a little tube or something that is straw a little bamboo straw put it in there and go down i think it would be useful to you for sure can i help with my natural 20 i think they're better to be used on your bolts and things like that can't he-- all right i'll take one it's fine with me you guys fine with that okay can i climb a tree and do i see anything on the horizon in where we're going like another tree clearing that looks like it might be up ahead athletics 24 rolled an 18 whatever you cast on me caleb is like i feel so good matt and but the lingering effects you know i'm in the afterglow so relaxed okay 17 i climb back down i say we gather some branches some scrap wood for firewood in case this might be the only forest we come across in a while see as far as we can get maybe we can hide under a rock for shelter or something i shoved one in the haversack too i gathered some stuff it's such a quiet bird i'm used to very loud birds oh yeah he's an owl now he's so cute mr owl was a dick it was a dick move do you have any awake you're looking at him i'm going to groggily stumble over put on my googles as i start stumbling towards the light yeah i'm going to walk and i'm like it's bright enough and i got to pee anyway i'll be right back okay no i'll stealth a little bit okay that was almost good 11 but he was on first watch amazing it's lubricated with all the blood of her enemies i reach back out to her and i go yes right we are so going to die i'm with you saving throw 15 yeah i'm not bad i'm not one of the bad guys that you were definitely talking about that i'm aware of right what bad guys are you talking about okay that's in the middle of nowhere okay 18 firbolg amazing i say bad guys kidnapping kids right that's scary stuff trying to protect your son who-- currently five-- but just call us the nein the mighty nein here m nein (whistles) the guitaya clan guai-- guiatao clan you say he's not your son but part of your clan is the whole clan wiped out who's left other half of our party members were taken from us in the middle of the night just last night seems very similar ways considering neither of the rest of us heard anything yeah nila she's the one going after them what was her son's name whispers you couldn't bring a horse back from the dead could you just didn't know how far your abilities stretch water closet's gone forever-- he saved our lives a lot (laughing) downtrodden that's caleb he always stands about 20 feet back can you do anything about this acid burn and i sit down next to her oh they are called ankhegs you guys we'll try thank you man normally fjord is here to do this part thank you that does feel good i did something today all right we leave we've already lost two of our horses why not lose a few more what you know if we stumble upon one of them maybe be like hey met your grandma i know that's a big deal that whole mission completing thing yeah fast pace seven i'm down as well but-- and in that hour we can look for a place to rest it's like pushing for the next rest stop can we look for a good camping spot oh shit 18 disadvantage on your checks along the way do we see anything that looks like a good alcove or somewhere that would be nice which we have advantage on right a six and-- oh no advantage i'll take that six with my add perception of three so nine nein he's hangry yeah i'm up too molly you want to take next watch all right 13 i'm not much of a gambler you're thinking of jester what what wait are these like playing cards or tarot cards you know i fucking hate those things i don't want anything to do with them the best lie i've ever told hmm all right deal let me flip to my backstory (laughing) natural twenty this one has a pretty big number on it that's fascinating what kind of scam wow that's pretty fascinating do you not like knowing your past that way you can have multiple backstories be multiple people at once i'll tell you one of my best lies the one i was most proud of just because it was a pretty good one yeah there was a politician in the town where i grew up that i didn't like very much didn't like his wife either wanted to find some dirt on them pretended to be a house hand for them a little handyman found some dirt found out they were cheating on each other and destroyed their relationships and their lives maybe i shouldn't be proud of that actually yeah anyway cheers just maybe don't have a job that relies on relationships either public opinion-- yeah i do my morning push-up and pull-up routine and then i'm ready to go dope as fuck yes i do holy shit you guys i just figured out how we can save 30 minutes (schwarzenegger voice) i feel like i'm always coming all right did we catch up to them we shouldn't clue them off that we're here okay maybe a couple of us could flank around what's the terrain what time is it we're nowhere near shadycreek lorenzo is a fighter type what was the name of the rogue again protto this is our fucking guy wait in the cages so we wait until they camp what were you going to say keg like mentally break them fuck and set up an ambush that's a damn good idea i wonder if we could do a little bit of both free the people in the cage and then ambush later nah that seems distracting at a medium pace i'm the worst helming a stealth check well i already have it i just haven't used it yet do i still have it i don't have it oh but i can look at it again i thought i might have needed it on the thing but i rolled a natural 20 on my sack check do i have to call that i'm going to use advantage on it before or i can roll and then choose don't fuck me gil yeah it's 20 total (whispers) should i do it again oh that was almost a natural 20 but instead it's five are we going to rest on the other side it lasts a day are we going to sleep on the other side yeah i'm going to save it five it's got to be just long enough to where they're zoning out not me i'm tired we need to plan that's actually not a bad plan just in case would they kill you on sight if they saw you we used it on the troll and it did nothing horses aren't a big threat i would rather focus on the people yeah but if we don't kill the people then they can kill us these seem like people who are confident in themselves-- ooh how rocky are those hills in between could we trigger a rock slide maybe using keg as a distraction up front-- couple fireballs have just certain targets between some of us i could stun somebody depending on how close i get maybe lorenzo try and square off against him of course all the spell-slingers are good to take out early as well maybe we focus on the druid and the sorcerer i feel like if you could hold the barbarian keep the barbarian away i could maybe stun lorenzo and focus down on the rogue and the druid i have ball bearings i have rope can we set some sort of tripwire trap is that something you can do you're good at finding traps are you good at setting traps with that big swinging log thing we send keg to distract you go in-- --right but if they try to go around it or something it's just a tree that's the name of this next chapter of our journey you guys no you go in and try and get the people out of the cage but wait you can't see the cages they're magically cloaked until you get there maybe you have to be close enough you go in try and get them out you come out send a signal through caleb that you're out and then caleb does a big slow thing slows them down we go in punk their asses we win we're victorious no with slow slow no we slow the people hang on let me go through this again we fell the tree we send in keg keg distracts we send in nott nott tries to pick the locks to the cages get the people out nott runs nott sends the message to caleb caleb does the slow spell on the party we go in we kick ass we win we're victorious i just said that 30 seconds ago did you guys get it this time no it is suspicious but it's distracting that's dumb maybe she's standing on the tree and she's like i'm a badass with an axe and a hammer and i took down this tree and now i'm going to take down you then we win we're victorious same plan sam and okay okay plan a-- plan a you do that we try to slow them if that fails you're our distraction let's do it oh snap he's a witch sam you know this he sees the future it wasn't that undercover it was max going no cast is allowed in here for ten minutes it wasn't that stealthy you weren't here for that we should get a mapmaking sock for him we are we wanted to film it this week but we got super distracted with building the studio taliesin wants to get rid of it i want to so bad nott and i look for the best elements of cover that's good that's good oh she's fine you beat me to it i'm aroused you have an awesome axe right i enjoy gilding lilies you would think there was a tornado that came through here i think the best trap we have is keg standing behind the tree where are you going to hide yeah i'll be in bush two molly are you taking bush one i'm bush two yeah these are great codenames do we have a signal as to when we go you're going to do the slow spell and then we fuck shit up dry running it no this way do you want to tradesies with molly yeah well it's called slow not stop if it was a stop spell it would be called a stop spell how far is your distance okay so further i think we want to try and get the slow spell off after it's past the log right no because i'm here i'm here caleb's here you're there because this will make them funnel which will gather them for caleb's spell what why don't you tradesies with me then how wide is your spell okay it's a 40-foot radius a cube i mean it's a 40-foot cube why would they be in a line you're just assuming they're going to be in a line instead of clumped together on the first one you slow the second one we attack we win still winning is part of this plan i just want to make sure that that's clear yes look for our friends oh yeah who has that shit yeah you do don't you because you haven't transcribed it you're out of paper but you're out of paper and how many feet ahead did you set that so are we doing invisibility or no yeah i need to rest i'm exhausted the sorcerer is the half-elf yeah i can move 40 feet my speed i'm pretty quick i've got some pretty dope mobility i think lorenzo is going to be a problem because he has reach and he's a leader if we find that half-orc druids tend to have healing abilities i'm just saying if they reveal themselves at the same time i feel like we shouldn't either we share body warmth by all spooning in a chain do i still have the dodecahedron i toss it to nott me too i'm so scared that's the sorcerer these are the two magic users the barbarian is a human 20 add my boots 20 a lot of bad guys there ruzza the sorcerer did the druid save the druid saved dwelma that's pretty dope though no nott is nott rolled a 21 and i rolled a 20 okay i'm probably more than 40 feet away from the druid sweet jump it is what i live for ten oh fuck okay two attacks first attack okay that's a natural 16 plus seven is 21 right 16 plus seven 21 and that's eight damage i'm going to spend a ki point to do stunning strike that really sucks i do have ball bearings take my second hit that's 20 total yeah another eight damage i'm going to spend another ki point to try stunning strike again what was that plus three 14 i'm burning through so many ki points i'm going to spend one more ki point to do patient defense because i'm probably going to need it now three ki points burning them out i know so quiet i'm still stoked on our-- was it umbrasyl the frost dragon yes i am when vorugal fought yenk no i ran over there i'm fighting the druid who's going to attack you the sorcerer disadvantage miss yeah does that mean i get to take an attack on her mage slayer i almost took that took sentinel instead yeah she was one of the ones that saved that's why i was trying to stun her sam what do you cast dispel magic on fuck that's why i was trying to stun her i think she still could have done it though that's not very good at all 12 what she doesn't move anywhere she's not moving she can't move and she takes five damage natural 20 yeah don't get frozen oh no fuck that's a good call oh god damn this fucking druid i'm just going to lay into the druid okay first attack natural 20 thank you gil that's doubling dice damage big money come on six plus four ten really second attack 14 plus seven so 21 i did 11 damage on my second attack on her fuck yes i have my bonus can i move and then attack again i thought about that but i have enough movement that i can make it to the barbarian right are you going to handle lorenzo who's going to handle lorenzo (shouting) who's going to handle lorenzo fuck i'm going to jump over the horses' asses and get to lorenzo 14 i have 40 feet of movement so wherever i can go can i land on the horse's back i'm on a horse am i within range of him i'm in combat range of him i'm going to spend another ki point to do patient defense i don't trust this motherfucker hopefully that's useful yeah 21 you get knocked unconscious not that am i flanking molly i can as sentinel 14 fuck no 16 misses 17 hits i can still use deflect missiles right to lower it you should know i have no respect for authority he's covered in shit there's the barbarian on caleb which is not good that's a lot of time i say hey keg-- no wait that's your name-- hey lorenzo this one's for beau-- no fuck i'm getting all my names fucked up because i'm so stressed out this one's for molly and yasha because we failed on this before i'm going to get it right this time i'm going to take my tinderbox and light it and i'm going to-- right onto him light him on fire i mean i'm touching him with it okay d6 plus what four i take my staff and pure brute anger right across his face 12 18 six damage i take my movement and go towards caleb and nott fuck yeah didn't you have a thing held for the sorceress they're going to try and capture molly she's dead another four damage fuck you lorenzo yeah don't ream us for all the things we probably did wrong there's nothing we can do to bring him back is there there's nothing we got
