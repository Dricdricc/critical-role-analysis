oh man drop it like it's hot and what weekend is new york comic con october 8th 9th 10th and 11th so you've got three weeks to prepare not even all of us were at san diego well we were all there just not all at one point at one time so much pressure we also have both of our artists here kit and wendy come here but come here we learned when we killed the carpet just time that time that actually we should all go find percy we should all talk to percy percy it's hard not to clearly notice that you're quite distressed and we're concerned and you know we were talking about it-- not that we were talking about you or anything behind your back or anything-- but we never really found out why you were in that prison cell when we found you did they take over whitestone are they still there what was she asking questions about what did they want was it just a political coup wait what were the names the briarwoods ripley sir kerrion stonefell who is he and professor anders who's that and do you remember why they were invited to whitestone to begin with and how many brothers and sisters do you have you said you saw a few bodies of family percy is this what you want and would they be able to recognize your face stealing from the workshop that you partially own calm down there he is that guy you meet on the corner of sandy alley yeah what if you're flying tiberius is working on it i have a feeling deep down inside yeah but we need to do research you barely know who the briarwoods are well they're not going to recognize any of us are they yes sorry yes i would like to stop and talk to gilmore first though before i leave do i have time for that i can fly in the air there's air traffic i have to worry about air traffic what no i use my beast shaping it lasts as long as i want it to last it's in my blood where are you going with this scanlan so when i mean as long as i want i mean long enough to where i've never had to really think about it before now well i could get ten hours because i can use two beast shaping abilities no i get my druid shapes back after a short rest because circle of the moon bitch can i make a stop first and then i'll run an errand yeah i've got my personal fundsies i have an earpiece right is there anything else you need from us percy is there anything you need while i'm out and about i'm going to go make a trip to gilmore's anybody want to join oh my god it's like calling time warner cable wait no sherri from vox machina we're sponsored by gilmore he put the brand on my armor that my mother gave me i was just curious if you guys had a chance to think about the alchemy workshop that we talked about before or if you maybe had any alchemy books that came in that i was requesting gilmore ugh what is taking him so long scanlan did sherri find my book sherri that would be good for scanlan okay how much are these sherri i mean they're-- they're all right 25 gold each oh come on i know some university student dropped these off and donated these don't kid me sherri am i doing it right do i sound like vex damn it sherri (whispering) scanlan scanlan will you buy those books for me and i'll reimburse you sherri is sassy today shut up i druidcraft a flower real quick and slip it to scanlan to give to her send the lizard to dwarf town how many more slurs can you have in one sentence wait is gilmore trying to say we owe him money they wanted a necklace right found a necklace who was supposed to go-- hang on i'm finding it i'm looking it's a sapphire pendant that should say to lorna my love thank you thanks it's not the one you're wearing right scanlan just because i think it's funny-- grog is flying over too right okay well i see you guys are flying the two of you to lorna with love it's written right there tiberius well i guess just the five of us cause grog and percy are back at the keep i can go back and check in on them you have an errand to run all right i'll go with vax-- wait we'll address that later come on vax you can cast that sigil anywhere right you don't have to be here we could do it from home we'll take a nap and we'll go tomorrow it's getting late the thunderbrands are probably going to bed at this point we don't want to invade they're probably just sitting down for dinner can i do a passive perception check to see if i notice him sneaking away perception or passive perception then that is 24 i just flipped through my book on the alchemy section for a bit got a little bit of the irish thing going on so grog you fell asleep in your plate of food and woke up with a beard they get nippy it's in the breed i still think maybe the more talkative members of the group should go i'm checking in with tiberius-- oh sorry percy it'll be fine we totally forgot about that actually i'll help with that campaign i do some braids and add some flowers is it important do you need me right now this is pretty important he's so comfortable look i gave him plenty of treats he doesn't even know what's happening ten more minutes i'll be down in ten minutes and i run downstairs really fast oh i knew she'd love it well they're not local they're coming into town they're coming into town in five to seven days not on them make a plan maybe make a plan we don't really have a plan i mean the only thing i can think-- percy do you still have an idea of what the briarwoods look like i could attempt another scrying spell could even possibly go to allura for help and try again what makes you say that exactly yeah if we tell uriel you're coming as someone else he's going to ask why wait who was it that came and talked to us who was that i was going to say it was seeker asum but he didn't say that uriel had his doubts he said he had his doubts let asum know right and your voice doesn't change so you probably don't want to try and sound like grog all night not to be-- sorry you were going to say something i like that we're not hired to kill the briarwoods and not to be that member of the group that has a golden heart and wants to ruin everyone's fun i don't want to stand between you and your revenge that you are absolutely owed percy but are you sure this is what you want is this going to make you feel better do you want to talk to them do you want us to fucking capture them and drag them back to the cell that we built in our keep we built it for a reason i know i've been opened up to so many things i've been reading my alchemy books we all know it was you oh god well add just my base wisdom yes plus six so 20 total did it work try it on tiberius high rolls startle him i go over and give him a cure wounds that was awesome (laughing) it's pretty good i produce a few flower cummerbunds and start pinning them on the party sylas and delilah (singing) hey there delilah i should have done something about this what are the names of these people who've taken over white-- i thought they said they had friends i also make a matching corsage and pin it on his lapel as well you know that's fine it might have had a more utilitarian purpose but it's fine oh i always do exactly it's on the rsvp yes she can is anyone waiting to greet them he got a date i've been scanning the crowd have i noticed anything over the past hour of any of our people any locals any council members who may be acting a little shifty any of them breaking a sweat acting weird 22 oh look tiberius they have bananas hi i mean we're also free we killed a beholder once we should just lead with that can i do an insight check to see if that look at percy-not-percy was-- she looked interesting the entire family all of them i'm sorry i'm just a little confused if the whole family died of disease weren't you afraid to go into this town into this castle weren't you afraid of contracting this disease yourself (whispered) i don't know what to do now hey you should hunter's mark them or something are you staying within the castle oh fantastic (laughs) yeah just snake flies down the hall-- dude i think they're into some weird shit they're creeping me out man now we're going to have to rescue vax oh please like you haven't rushed into a situation before orion yeah or or launching a fireball in
