the game hang on where is it where did i put it happy birthday 107 episodes later has it been days feels like an eternity i was angry i was very angry and maybe if we had this conversation yesterday even i might be yelling that to your face right now but it's hard to be angry at bravery and selflessness i mean we've always had the problem of you having one too many ladies in your life right (laughs) it's hard to compete with a god it's not your fault i wouldn't take it back you taught me how to take chances (laughs) can i ask you a question what exactly was the deal that you made with the raven queen was it when we slew vecna or defeated him i have a feeling semantics are becoming increasingly more important even if we found a way you wouldn't take it to reverse the deal i'm not asking i'm just confirming it's fitting really you can protect that plane i'll be here to protect this one i mean if these past few days have taught us anything it's death isn't the end i just don't want to forget if sprigg could forget the names of his party members that he died alongside-- he ran-- never mind what's going to happen in a hundred or hundreds or even a thousand years i don't want to forget this what if there comes a day when i don't even recognize the name vox machina anymore i can name a few i'm grateful for you and i always will be and i'm grateful for any second that we have left and i don't want to spend any more being angry at you and i'm sorry that i was (laughs) of course not yeah it's the weirdest thing by the way you being cold i mean it's just something to get used to yeah i'm sorry this head cold mixed with crying is bad it's the worst (raspy singing) what are they feeding you yes i can (unsure) yes and you roll 2d10 extra yeah dope oh that is an excellent question how long do my speeches-- said katharine hepburn okay so can i double up on that oh yeah since my voice is completely shot and i don't want to do a speech i am going to do-- marisha and of us swimming through the volcano and then going underground and shielding ourselves and then fighting and then grog's forging the trammels (enthusiastic a cappella music) hey pike could you also do one of those to tary tell him we're all alive this marker sucks balls it's a bit away from vasselheim if i remember i did see a tree right that was near the town so yeah yeah she was coming out of thar amphala and she was coming out she had both of her eyeballs back and was like ooh it's chilly bitch enjoying the winter snow two regular eyes why do you think she keeps coming back (gasps) oh no travis laura and i don't know maybe she made a deal similar to the deals we've made but with vecna i mean if gods can give us their blessing why can't she have one yeah a trail of black sooty bubbly goodness well i have a tree i can get us there boulder-parchment-shears oh i hope not how many does she get (mafia-style voice) how many you got yeah he's got that whole barbarian knock me down i get back up again thing that's why he would be a rogue/barbarian i think hi maybe i should have found a tree less in the center of things yeah i don't think any of us have them can we make our way to the shoreline i stop everybody saying be careful it looks like it could be a thousand feet which is deceiving a thousand feet is so long can i tell if the storm is coming or the storm has passed i'm a motherfucking human barometer natural 20 yeah i'm really good at the check five miles well i mean we could we can i would rather save my 8th-level animal shapes in case we need to bail i love fenna in my salads i would like to argue he just disguised himself for a solid year wait what's her name senth it is the principle but do we have time for principles i mean that's fine i'd prefer a shitty ship if it's cheaper she's got a high-ass insurance policy on this bitch oh boy santy shanty matt and well we have five miles ahead of us ugh no i'm going to go fix with that whatever you know what i'm saying (wind noises) after those initial winds i take them and keep us going for a little bit actually it should be only about half an hour now well then there's the professor and mary ann yeah well you may be the professor so maybe you're mary ann does that make me ginger yeah actually yeah it's a 2nd-level spell gust of wind santy is so wise he sees the sea look at him santy of the shanty seas sees the sea do you think santy of the shore shanty sells sea shells i see you're also skilled in interpretive dance you're very good water breathing and trinket (poof) keyleth uses alter self to give herself the gill hands the webbed fingers again that was cool i'll be with percy more up front it's like that game we all played when we were growing up i can light up my flame hands travis and but it's magic i thought it doesn't matter do i see any-- (garbled) do i see-- are there any pockets other than the main pressure point that might be a smooth entry point okay yeah all right so it's hot water and gas coming up if i theoretically wanted to do a control water spell and reverse the water inwards could we go in through one of these tunnels through one of these fissures i'm more thinking for all of us i don't know how else we're going to get in i could be a water elemental though if we want to wait a few minutes i could do a commune with nature i'm going to be like underwater tea party (glugging) and do a commune with nature for a little bit i get three questions i want to find any easy tunnels man-made tunnels that aren't going to bake us alive any dangerous creatures in the area that's good and the anvil okay all right yeah 300 feet are there any man-made tunnels that will grant us access into the volcano without burning us alive and where are they are there any tunnels getting into the volcano i'm afraid that 300 feet-- within 300 feet i can see the area yeah hostile creatures hostile creatures in the area dangerous hostile creatures how many more adjectives can i throw in there do harm ill will earth elemental i can make tunnels are we concerned if i start boring tunnels into the side of this that magma and pressure will start releasing out the side is my mantle helping with the heat what if i'm controlling the currents i didn't find anything that's what i was saying i'm afraid of the pressure our water breathing lasts for 24 hours scanlan your burrowing what means are you using for that touch√© i have a feeling that's exactly what it is it's going to suck working around that thing sorry scanlan okay can we tag-team this okay what if you burrow and i push the water away-- yeah control water i can push it away and if you do that then maybe we can all get in and then maybe i can throw up a wall or i can control the currents and suck us all right through down the top as part of control water i can reverse the currents no it's water and gas and pressure i can also part water like fucking moses that would be one of your top-level spells yeah i mean we can still walk the perimeter if you want we can walk the perimeter investigation natural 20 (cheers) how big is the jet yeah can grog fit okay is it made out of stone can i call this earth can i call this rock so move earth would not work you are good at destroying structures can i transmute the rock into dirt or sand to give us a little more i have transmute rock or we can let grog go first we're trying to go through an outward jet to this caved-in air pocket okay okay let me control water with the current and can i redirect the current up and around us to allow us to get in okay yeah i'm pushing the water parting it giving us a little all right push the water wall of stone (boom) oh you punched a volcano oh oxygen weirdo control water lasts up to ten minutes so if we want to commit to this i can help jettison us there why we decided early on that wall of stone was instantaneous and permanent because it was in pathfinder the water just happens us breathing water is good for 24 hours no i'm going to control water and i'm going to jettison us with the current yeah it'll be like lazy river for the whole duration but i haven't done that because i've already jettisoned this one water and then now i'm trying to use the remaining-- over lava so bad at it find the path but i think i have to have seen the object before it would also burn my last 6th-level spell why does this always happen to us is it the same foot yeah wait we're waterboarding ourselves and i use my mantle which i constantly forget triples my jump distance that's not great acrobatics oh that's better that's better 15 earth elementals volcanic earth elementals dope 34 i loved it so much it's like 2006's the core jurassic park rules do what oh your sneak attack might still be able

the jug no you do no true polymorph you absorb your gear and you don't benefit from it but it doesn't say anything about you not benefiting from-- correct the gear melds into the new form the creature cannot activate use wield or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment but it doesn't say anything else other than equipment you're very welcome do the two twins want to scout so is it the allhammer

big strides big strides i try to look more normal while still taking big strides no one of these days you're going to break someone's nose speak in morse code grog do you trust this the reliefs the people in the wall okay it was a hypothetical question just to be safe i cast freedom of movement on grog just in case so loose so free so much movement yeah i'll be with vex wait is that ding to your saving throws considered a curse and you said there were three warriors while he does that i stand in the middle are the three warriors triangulated if you were to draw out a triangle between them in
