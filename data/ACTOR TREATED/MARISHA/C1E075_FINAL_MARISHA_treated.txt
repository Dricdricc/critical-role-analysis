in search of a piece of armor something that holds great weight and many legends behind it maybe you have it is called the plate of the dawnmartyr are you familiar with this i don't believe it is from this realm but it resides here it was won by a fire giant as yourself in a game of cards or some call them card games (sighs and laughter) really that would be phenomenal information well look you shouldn't compare it to you or the things you've made right i'm sure-- yes it's very valuable for us to find it yes i'm assuming you don't want me to-- right (quietly) do we still have all those jewels i look at whaska and i say let me confer with my other masters hey senokir what does he want what do you think is fair here craft they want something-- okay sure yeah i'll ask whaska in

resume what if we give him some of the dragon scales hang on whaska a great craftsman such as yourself deserves only the finest of materials how about some (whispers) dragon scales dragonhide white

the suutan-- oh wait i already asked him that never mind you know what been a huge help (laughter) is it too late to roll an insight check to make sure he was telling us the whole story that's pretty good 25 you know it's more cumbersome it's awkward it's very wide i can't really-- yes but it's not that heavy thank you how is it they didn't design this to fit into a car you walk backwards are you okay going down the stairs okay okay is it like a cityscape yes we know sorry yeah no i will not that's a scanlan or a percy thing that's true that spell lasts for ten minutes the locate item spell i can cast it because i shouldn't speak here thanks oh giant my fair giant i'll cast locate item no one's around and going to maim me right it's here it's going to be right on the inside hanging on the wall are there really high windows they're 20 feet high so high up i radio over the earpiece to vax and say hey we're going to walk the block knock yeah sure help me hey pike can you help prop it up on that side what what bullshit goddamn it natural one pike i need to readjust my grip here i want to put it on my back yeah i don't want to drop it will it kill all of us is it a blast radius thing what are they wearing lemmiwinks we're here to speak with juuraiel oh jesus i'm the only one not in chains i'm the only one who can it's bullshit no i can't it's only a self spell or else i would've oh that's not too bad persuasion 18 i lift with pike the big manhole cover yes let me get us out of this juuraiel do you mind if we speak candidly and dispose of our guises that led us here i said we'd dropped our guises so yes everyone you can take your slave robes off now senokir can we-- hell yeah let's do this does it work like vegas are all the odds on the house wait did we end up playing it fucking fuck we didn't end up playing this but wait we remember the rules but that's risky can he add his bardic inspiration wow high five yeah and into another one yeah i was going to ask that nice lampshade am i okay do i still have fire resist i'll just roll this time it's just straight constitution seven can i bamf right here what's your name what is simma sina-- senokir took a ten-minute break and that's it senokir is there a way we could-- if i wanted to plane shift home is there a way that i could plane shift right back here and not get you know our heads chopped off for it let me check guys you know let me check the druidic texts and see what they say well i can't say senokir's jewelry shop in the city of brass bless you bless you again i can also create water pike and i can create water me and pike both can or allies nearby it's in the middle of a city classic b&e plane shift takes a minute-- it takes an action as long as we're all in a circle holding hands in case it's magically locked down he also said that the pit fiend could be there in one to two days also do we know how much time passes in the fire plane versus the real world do we remember any type of relative time jump when we were here last time in and out yeah i mean we could come back to thordak just destroyed everything i can't scry between dimensions yeah yes i could yeah can i use the scrying eye to try and scry on the pit fiend and trying to imagine his emblem that she described with the two manacles and the black chain because that was pretty cool 19 it doesn't say yeah i get to do it so it should still be mine right 19 can i get a focus on what the slaves look like okay well he appears to be in his bedroom definitely in the citadel as she said he had big gnarly teeth and slaves he looked very unpleasant well he also had a bunch of people chained to the wall and this was after my vision being slammed through several walls it seemed to be very deep in the labyrinth that is the embassy which seems like a labyrinth he's a little taller than grog i tried to look i couldn't tell looked like a nice variety unless we tried to use ourselves as slave bait again put a few of us on the auction he has a logo seeming allows you to tailor us right how about we do a little bit of both we can have a few of us maybe two as slaves the rest as masters walking around incognito once one of us gets sold off we track him back so we're not fighting a member of the embassy of the city of brass in the middle of the market these people have seen a lot of shit not just one hunk of shit is that a fantasy that people have can i also throw out that maybe six might be pushing it a little maybe we should drop it down to like quadruplets i feel like we're spending a lot of time on this and maybe not enough time on our battle plan or we could seeming wings can i use alter self because alter self gives-- because i can give myself gills and stuff like that it's like when you start the little halloween sing-y things maybe have a little side area with hookah and some nice dancers you know as he watches to add to the atmosphere what if the ladies went on a redecorating tear really fast dim the lights that's so mean do we recover our point of exhaustion when we sleep are we going to scout-- i guess we still need seeming did we find out if i could alter self wings should we maybe go scout the location first as regular slaves laura sam and taliesin  no no it's okay i druidcraft a band around his arm you can like preserve it is it okay to just set up shop i could also theoretically-- i just don't know well these things can see through other things i could do hallucinatory terrain right around this and make us look like a little legit kiosk with a little entrance incorporating your door i can control it as much as i want i mean i could do some druidcraft but that's minor growing a gazebo out of vines that's plant growth i guess i could do plant growth fairly instantly without the full-- because it's a one or the other kind of a thing i still feel like if we are a crowd of slaves at a door-- can i druidcraft some nice inviting looking bushes shrubs yeah never mind then what this is what we are now see there are a lot of pop-up vendors here guys maybe you'll be more impressive i could try and scry on him while we wait there is an alley behind us that we set up in front of does anyone seem to be behind the alley scanlan do you want to come with me back into the alley for a little bit and watch in case anyone sees you could be giving me a good firm scolding just in case well it takes a minute to do the scrying stand guard i'll be right back i go back to a little dark corner and i pull out the scrying eye i can try again yeah whenever i can should i do something theatrical magicky we didn't really specify i'm in the alleyway with the twins 15 feet across the street i packed this just in case no i packed feeblemind it's an 8th-level spell and it makes him stupid no well i could use alter self as one of the female aasimar this guy has to make an intelligence saving throw do you want me to try and make this guy stupid he's 15 feet away no i'm outside i'm in the alleyway how many feet away am i from him is he aware of my presence i'm going to saunter further down the alleyway this has a 150-foot range ooh that's good 21 okay so wait what are you doing as he goes to hand over the chains right as he goes to reach for it i'm going to do feeblemind jesus fucking christ he's got to make an intelligence saving throw 19 come on come on he takes 4d6 psychic damage he saved from it didn't he he's not affected by the ability gives us time to think we'll get you that armor
