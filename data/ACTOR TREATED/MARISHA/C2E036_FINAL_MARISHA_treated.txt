brava sam is my favorite when he's judging his own jokes i feel like someone needs to name a bong blaza minnelli by the way that's a perfect bong name i'm so tired go watch it luckily we recorded it all we did have one traveler is my co-pilot yes hey vinny that fish has instant regrets what did i do we just lost money on that death it was a very expensive death freudian slip it's bad when you say it like that what that's right you can speak with dead though right is that something you can do maybe that's how we interrogate him i'll help you out yasha's following me i'm like you can follow me but i'm just-- 15 it just looks more dope now yeah we look like badasses i think it makes the ship look cooler yeah we look rad yeah but but we still have the ink of that and darktow is also an island i don't know i got distracted by the sleeveless coat aspect that's all i heard the mistake he's kind of the worst professor thaddeus taliesin and the second oh that's right right you want me to wake him up all right okay (impact) that was gentle right good morning don't think that far into it man it was a cool line probably not how many times have you worked with jawgrasp or avantika in the past and what were you doing for them before well that's his own damn fault he has poofy sleeves fucking bullshit (ripping) (laughter) yeah throw them overboard (laughter) yeah you should it was a pretty fucking dope thing okay here is the thing this reputation you keep talking about that you are so deeply concerned about-- aw can i have it (laughs) deflect missiles why are you so concerned with this reputation of yours how long have you been running around in the criminal underworld is what i'm saying no i've met this type he plays stupid that way if people start asking questions you've got disbelief still doesn't mean you're not a criminal though take a little walk we'll continue talking when you get back god i hate him swavain wait does the ball make you powerful is there something going on the three you just named i mean it sounds like she wants this thing wait are you saying the mis-steak like a good filet mignon or like a mistake oh that's a good point maybe we should talk about the whole nicodranas thing really fast i don't think any of us did can we return back to your hometown ever again after that i feel like we might need to drop some-- also we have a couple of members of the mighty nein that seem a little bit disparate i'll join i maneuver to the other side but sit leaning up against the ship out of it but here as they walk away and since caleb wandered up-- do you truly believe the amount of justification you were just doing for our actions everything we just did definitely had a long string of-- sounded like convincing yourself and maybe the rest of us and i just wondered how much you actually believed it or how much you're trying to convince yourself that you didn't fuck up real bad okay that's great it's not our home but does that give us the right to shit on everyone else's all right okay i don't know i'm not looking for answers-- eh people can adapt it's just that-- i've done a lot of shitty things and i've made a lot of shitty choices and a lot of mistakes and after molly i told myself that i was going to try and not do that as much but it's fucking hard can we justify murdering six people to have jester's mom be a little bit better off okay yep they attacked us and i walk away yeah uh conflicted i guess i don't know look i know we reacted accordingly and in self-defense but we probably could have a been a little bit smarter about that entire situation it's been a fucking day in a part of myself i'm a little mad because-- i don't know everything that tortle was telling us about marius and how he hangs out at the docks and waits until midnight and i'm like (scoffs) what a random fun guy just hanging out by the docks at mid-- i don't know everything about that should have connected in my brain that-- in a fucked up way i can actually relate to that quite a lot for me i've always had my fists and man is it way easier to solve problems when you're beating the shit out of somebody like we were justified in our actions yeah jester had a good talk with him i think he'll actually be okay we might need to do a little bit more maintenance i feel bad i've treated people like shit my whole life and having one transformative moment doesn't mean that you're immediately going to be a different person overnight and being better is something you have to work at i guess i can understand taking the easy way out with the power that you have it's what i've done my whole life i just don't know anything else though walks away from us i've driven most people in my life away from me hearing him talk like that it's not the first time i've heard those things and i don't want to drive you guys away i don't want us to drive each other away (sighs) anyway is there any damage-- whoever's there is there any damage control we want to consider in nicodranas before we fuck off forever stand-up comic this has turned into a resource management game lemonade tycoon oh yes lifeboat is there a-- or we could just leave the boat out in the ocean a little bit and take the skiff in super into it i have a thought there was something we used to do and sometimes i'd get hired to do in my town a little bit of subterfuge if we wanted to try and-- well this one's a little bit more under the surface in fact quiet is the key we used to do little whisper campaigns just going into bars pubs start talking a little bit loudly about the pirate crew and captain jawgrasp and the hell that he unleashed on the docks the other night fuck it he's dead yeah i don't even think we'd throw our name in the mix never mention ourselves just-- build a narrative start talking just a little bit louder than what you should in public maybe whispering to some bartenders well my thought was if we split up a little bit you guys focus on hiring a crew someone else focus on spreading some words can we slowly in shifts navigate towards a cove fuck me sounds insane we can always pull in the ship really fast to load on the crew and then peace out let's sleep so tired (laughs) yes you're asking everyone oh no not for the mistake maybe burn the flag ooh jester you have a disguise kit right would you do my makeup for me could you disguise me (whispering) whisper campaign i thought we fixed-- did we fix that did we fix the black sphere we always make these plans and then abandon them good call i hand off 20 gold to caleb here here's for hiring crew you're with me on the whisper campaign that's what i'm talking about can you be a cook wait are we at a bar or something if we stop at any bars along the way (whispering) whisper campaign okay i'll do deception natural 20 i disseminate that these ruffian pirates coming in messing up our nice and peaceful nicodranas again i heard it was that captain jawgrasp he came in and he deceived his own crew and he murdered them all in a plot of vengeance and greed and then he took the boat and he went off on his own succeeded yeah we're already great yeah oh yeah it was so dark but the sails seemed black like the heart of captain jawgrasp just like his soul yeah maybe this-- we got to come up with something better than green-skinned dwarf that's not a real thing ooh this is getting so complicated with each layer that's true she drove the captain mad with the vengeance-- yeah now her spirit lives on and she is haunting sailors looking for her long-lost lover i'm just saying spooky coincidences we once again put misinformation out about the boat what it looked like i think it was orly let's go get orly should we say we're the mighty nein we met you the other night no maybe not (shouting) a week yes we did it can i assist him with counting as they go by i keep sharpening it and it's just shit-- mine and matt's wedding rings are rose gold take your gold and leave well i mean it looks like there's not a main trade route both hands or just one yeah we have a thing caduceus do you actually even know what you're looking for so you came with us because we thought we were a sign and now you're looking for the next sign when we fully get out of the reach of the land by the way as we're sailing away i just want to keep an eye out on the horizon and be like professor see if i see him i throw some dead pigeon or seagull in the air nope seven i'll go individually yeah perception natural one yeah that's just a photo opportunity i'm leaning on the edge and i just go caleb this is boring it's just blue jester's more interesting to look at no don't give me that much credit yet i still could what oh my god he doesn't look as angry as professor thaddeus is he i poke him and see if he bites me everything that i touch my hands are registered weapons thanks caleb thank you where is yasha i go down is yasha still sleeping or is yasha still here (shouting) yasha are you still here (shouting) yasha's still here just wanted to give you a quick update fjord saw a thing with two wings appeared to be humanoid flying off the boat and just wanted to make sure-- (shouting) yasha's coming i'm going to turn around and do a scan of the horizon do i see anything i'll put my goggles on just in casies nine eight look personal identification jesus here's my boots sorry that's because ashley's not here to roll initiative for herself 20 for beau natural 20 with a quick glance does it look like the sail is worth trying to save any further or is it fucked just with a quick glance they look like they're still going for it okay i'm going to run over and try and collapse the sail so it's not unfurled try and collapse it i don't know if that's the right call 17 whatever's quickest can i take a bonus action to do patient defense after i do that caduceus is back kill it come at me bitch miss patient defense pop it's all i have 13 i believe that hits this is unarmed ooh ten total okay i'm going to use the rope that i'm holding onto and i'm going to use that to lift myself up and do like a little swinging double-kick action to this harpy little cirque du soleil shit both hit that's a 16 and a 19 pop pop for both of them eight plus five is 13 plus another six is 19 still up i'm going to take the rope and wrap it around my fist once and pop with my bonus action no flurry of blows two attacks pop pop let me roll for two attacks okay that is 14 for one and a natural 19 for the other ten damage yep it was better results than i expected yes the deckhand one come on come on that's pretty good threats are all gone more or less glad you're not dead again buddy are you saying you want to retire from adventuring life caleb you're so-- why are you so stiff we've only done this once before caleb it's still weird i just want to point that out okay let go of me get off yeah he wants his dead people tea seeing nott butcher the harpy i go ooh i look in my pocket and i pull out owl frumpkin is owl frumpkin okay hey sorry about that back in my pocket i make his head dance a little bit come on me and yasha help with the barrel-train i miss my druid with what what it's fabric i'll go up there and hold that safety line that you were talking about i'm still part of the water bucket brigade aw does it look like there's a little island nearby does it look like they're coming or going from that island you know that video of the monkeys throwing the raccoon that's what i imagined is there anything in the sails any flags iconography my perception checks have been garbage six weren't we on boats for our first gen con liveshow that's actually a good thing we were trying to figure out what to wear we do the cast of south pacific yeah can the ladies be pirates i mean i know you can two-day ship any type of-- yeah especially ones that look like for sex role play you can get tons of those i was going to say it was the high school pilot outfit
