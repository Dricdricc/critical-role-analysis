i think i saw that in my dare class (laughter) continuing the 1991 trend no i also didn't tell geek and sundry we were doing this and then vote we'll be there waiting in lines at public schools just like everybody else that's cool thordak will experience all of those things he will burn and he will suffer and you will not be there to watch it happen you want to feel the burning inside of you oh you will feel it raishan but it will not be from thordak or whatever proposed cure he made up the burning you feel will be from the souls of ten thousand fire ashari as they sear your flesh and the last thing that you will see will be my face as i watch you suffer as you watched a quarter of my civilization burn oh you commend me for bravery oh raishan for someone who is supposed to be so smart-- i am not afraid i know what you are you are a parasite you walk around calling yourself a magnificent ancient dragon you are nothing more than a leech you consumed the energy of my people for years and we're supposed to just trust you (shouting) call me child one more goddamn time (shouting) which you did you unleashed the mad dog you bitch this is your fucking fault (quieter) he's just a mad king as you said so yourself you're the master planner but your plan backfired didn't it so now you've come to us and you think that you can formulate some other master plan that's still going to somehow get you what you want you dumb fool when will you fucking learn raishan you're weak by mine too sounds like a life happily ever after could be a good way for you to show us your loyalty even though you have none but know raishan whatever deal we strike does not end in you leaving my sight you're going to die you're going to die even if i have to die doing it can we please just fucking kill her now oh she's already done that it's pretty gross why do you think thordak is the only one with knowledge of a cure because that puny little druid that cursed you-- well don't forget you're dealing with a puny little druid right here that seems to be the solution to all of our problems chicken soup for the dnd soul what was the question i still don't really know why we need her to begin with we're powerful enough why don't we just kill her now are you inviting she was first on my list but this could be our best chance could be the easiest-- she's not making this easy to walk away you guys oh i know the consequences of every step of my actions it is you raishan who did not realize the biggest consequence is standing in front of you right now i don't give a flying shit we walk away and you die or we stay (whispering) and you die i know you know oh jeez what is that anyone you touch you're then putting yourself in danger if any of our friends wind up dead we're looking at you first where's asum did we already cover that i was very angry i couldn't hear a whole lot (whispers) bitch i agree with that can i do a scan of the room like a perception check to see if i notice magical traps or anything weird set up investigation no is there anything off does it look like there's an opening general perception 21 is grog talking to me about patience right now that's so extreme grog-- did thordak tell you about the trinkets of ours that you wanted about what we have i mean she knows we thought she was asum we talked and she knows she knows we told her everything what does he want do you have any ideas on how to defeat vorugal what's interesting is the way that stacks too keyleth holds her hand out to shake her hand i heat up my hands a little bit with my flame hands feel the burn can i get an insight check on that check in with the boss see if she's going to turn around and tell him everything come on natural 20 it wasn't bad it was a 15 so 26 all right let's go yes i can yeah let's go down to the war room are we in the war room can we go down and talk about this in the war room keyleth screams her head off for a second i don't think i understood until that moment what you did she's a fucking idiot what do i know about melora and this curse because there are a lot of druids who worship melora that's not good i never do religion checks nine this whole thing could be an entire trap unless she was scrying on us which is highly possible i would have to have a super high perception in order to maybe sense it is there a way i can start looking out for that the spire of conflux was born from melora so i'm wondering-- yeah oh i've been thinking about that staff for a while i'm wondering if i can get to the staff quick enough it could be the key to really defeating raishan correct and vorugal loves something to hunt kill raishan i like this plan apparently it's a goristro a goristro it's a barista and she's really angry because it's fall time pumpkin spice lattes on what a goristro is apparently his name was yenk yank in anything fiend-centric she's here yeah we know what it is can we go to a library find a picture okay i stare blankly into space if i live past killing these dragons yeah what do you want i have a born duty to my people that's hard to escape i guess we'll cross that bridge when we get there (whispers) which cloak oh the displacer cloak seems to be a trend watching all of us fall any luck i don't think that's true gods really enjoy being vague what'd she say which sphinx we've seen two now damn it why do they have to be so cryptic ugh i don't think i wear it as well as you it's a little baggy that made me a little nauseous let's go i think there's a lot we need to do just in case emergency poison maybe an enemy will come over right internet we knew it wasn't for raishan isn't it breast cancer awareness month it is right check your boobs ladies the raven queen that's what i said right had to do the whole name trial so the first one was near where the cindergrove is osysa was her name ioun it's a little baggy but thank you i got a wink from vex oh is that yenk i thought you were working in the middle of-- i said hi percy it's not my fault no one notices i'm around it's not my fault i'm a fucking wallflower it's going to have to be either scanlan or me but-- scanlan hey hey grog come on in but you could close the gate once it passes through also kima wanted to come with us to fight the white dragon remember she's not but if kima is going then maybe allura will i have another question how far are we timeline in the year how close are we getting to winter's crest when's the next solstice there's not a summer solstice and winter solstice 24 thordak was busted out on the winter's solstice right also the briarwoods were rushing to try and get the ziggurat up and running in time for the solstice very important day where nature and stars tend to align and planes can blur a little bit the sooner she dies the happier i'll be vorugal lived in a cave well here's my question i'm sure she's anticipating us turning on her what would you do if you were a green dragon anticipating people turning on you keep that in mind we could be getting spied on are we being watched what did you say about ioun and why is ioun important right now scanlan do you still have those ioun stones okay was raven's slumber the name of the temple that's your necklace that's got trinket in it what if we go back to that temple never mind keep going i'm just trying to figure this out here's what i think she's going to find out eventually and then what do we say when they all know we've known the whole time but then what happens when kima goes did you guys know these are the people we need to trust us they are our allies that was also years ago and we were aware and we could have told her she going to be angry at not telling her the full parameters this is not someone we want to lose our trust no she is not a soldier in our manifested army she is our friend and ally there is a difference right now this is a different duty and relationship but she'll choose a fight unaware of exactly what she's getting into this is lady kima we are talking about she is one of the most hard-headed people we know she is going to push until we tell her what happened so then either we tell her the truth and trust that she can keep a secret or she doesn't come she's going to find out and i don't want to lose her trust percy-- i don't trust anyone right now she's going to be mad at us either way so it depends on if she's mad at us now or even more angry at us later well look she's then going to wonder why we uninvited her we are lying to her no matter which way we take right now look i want her there more than anything i don't want to lie to her and i also don't want her dead and i don't want to drag her into a situation she could have known more about so we're bringing her we're going well you know what i've got to handle something first i don't see any difference in raishan being able to kill us in our sleep here or there and kima please remember between me and you of all people before we trusted the illithid we trusted you you're right i didn't trust you they trusted you i didn't i'm getting to my point but we grew past that and now i trust you more implicitly than most people in this world i'm going to go talk to the sun tree just gather your shit i'll meet you there the sun tree well done yes i wanted to go underneath in our little sun tree cave that we carved out yeah and i cast commune with nature (laughs) there's so much pressure on this is there a way i can put my hand inside the sun tree dear sun tree-- okay i'm going to cast commune with nature and try and connect with the sun tree sun tree hey sun tree without burning a question can i personally ask you how are you doing man yeah okay man yeah hey sun tree so you're overtop all these arcane ley-lines across the whole globe right i've traveled a lot of places here lately what are all the cities that the other arcane ley lines fall across can i sense it through the sun tree's roots are there any cities any places of interest i can see that we've been through before where they happen to cross i'm trying to see if i can use the sun tree to extend my vision a little further yeah i want to extend a little further so the ziggurat the spinning orb of death that happens to be right underneath you are you in touch with what that might be feeding goddamn it sun tree goddamn it i'm not angry with you sun tree that's really easy for you to say sun tree okay all right sun tree you're a tree from pelor yes have there been the attention of any other gods on whitestone right now that you can sense or can i sense i'm asking the sun tree out of humor but can i sense it i'm assuming the tree doesn't actually know fucking shit that's so sad you've got me sun tree i'm here you shouldn't be lonely aww that's so-- aww okay sun tree i don't think i have much time left but is there anything-- you said you're lonely i just want to say if you ever want to talk i'm here you know you can confide in me if there's anything you want to say i'm all ears you know yeah you know i didn't really get any of the things i was looking for sun tree but i still feel a little better thank you yeah you're cool sun tree aww not as cool as you yeah okay i'm going to be walking through you here in a minute so i wanted to let you know that there's going to be eight people going through so don't feel alarmed does that hurt you oh okay i'm sorry i'm not going to stop doing it but i'm sorry all right bye sun tree sure i was feeling relaxed and i grew a tree right didn't i grow some trees i pick one of those trees what time is it here i can scry once we get in the mansion can i cast it ahead of time sorry can i cast heroes' feast at a higher level no i brought transport via plants i can do it in the morning it is pretty important can i do it as a ritual spell i'm going to scry i don't want to necessarily scry on vorugal but can i scry in her-- what do you mean instead of spying on vorugal i can scry a few times oh i'll step outside the mansion to scry i step outside the mansion and i take a good hard look around hey 14 first i'm going to scry on tooma what's going on around her do people seem to be preparing for a battle i take the cloak and wrap it around as much as i can now i'm going to scry on that outside entrance to vorugal's lair okay because we were in there earlier so can i scry on the location not trying to focus necessarily on vorugal scrying on the dragon or the location or both not knowing could be more dangerous did vorugal have any other allies do you remember some of the guards all right i abandon the campaign and go back inside where exactly are we going to-- do we have a plan on dropping this beast should we go try and talk to tooma now fly there i can polymorph you yeah in the same area i can drop polymorph as long as you guys keep me in contact with the earpieces then i don't know are the earpieces going to stay in range then i'm going to go minxie form my white snow-tiger and i will stay within earshot range so that way if anything goes bad i can alert the rest of the group earpieces i'll follow as close as i can let's go without having some sort of-- yeah they would know they've been tracking down animals for it to hunt for a while they have to tell him where to find it i think you have to cast it on yourself i can enhance one of y'all's abilities so you have advantage on rolls for a stat i can do that to one of you that's what i was thinking i'm going to cast enhance ability and that's a dex ability the cat's grace or whatever it was cat's grace on scanlan i'm going to turn into minxie i'm going to stealth as far behind them as i can i'll stalk the top of the ravine and keep an ear open and keep an eye out for anything that looks horrifying and bad what do i use just nature 15 i start pacing that way assuming it's them (meows) i got this form from being in the mountains of my hometown so yes they can ride me i'm that big (strained noises) back hurts come on the diseased deceiver well i'm going to write that down can i use enhance ability to help him out with his spellcasting yeah they've got fancy names for each one like cat's grace eagle's splendor honey badger spock is that what you just said yeah we can talk this time
