are employees eligible hope it does well yeah and last week when we weren't here two comics you can find those comics at geekandsundrycom they're awesome little four-panel weekly comic strips going through the backstory of vox machina at the winter's crest festival not at all sam of course this is all free through the geek and sundry website you should after the show it's us being cute surrounded by all the sadness we have yours there we go oh is it sold out again certain sizes are and terrified do it it's fine we're just starting we haven't done anything grog speaking of how many health potions do you have i feel like we might need to redistribute you should do that how about safety for your life because we'll be having your back and whatnot i'm going to let that one go that's possibly very true actually cassandra has there been any instance where the two have separated in the recent months that you can imagine or remember can you think of any reason why they would separate something sudden that required their attention in the sun plus we'd just abandon this entire revolution that we caused are we going to try and separate these two is that the plan the sparkles are magical following up the ranks with trinket i guess so happy to have you here is she glowing i'll be in charge of guiding trinket he's still my friend at least the bear still loves me hopefully we won't be in a hurry that's for trinket can i cast gust of wind really quick and push it back down the hallway that's true we're immune to fear and poison also doesn't your belt of dwarvenkind have something like that no okay never mind i know it's hard it's deep underground hey no it's fine i'll just leave it it's fine how big is the door yeah something's going on here so pike and i are going up percy and cassandra does this material mean anything to you the bronze does it keep any type of energy out why build a room out of bronze and the floor is bronze i don't even know i'm not great with magic i'm great with nature and i'm not great with dungeoneering or anything like that either can i do some sort of nature check to see if this is a quarry that we just walked into a conductor yeah it's not really a nature thing though okay not my forte oh natural 20 and would i gather any information on the purpose of this room and what it's used for oh we're too far away to see what it's made out of there's no vents there's no ventilation shaft there's nothing sure you've got this all of those sound like bad ideas i'm with scanlan i say we just go but maybe mine and scanlan's is a good idea question are the stones mathematically adjacent to each other do they appear to be lined up and they're all lined up okay i'm going to walk in a little bit are there any on the ceiling natural one that's good metal good craftsmanship damn i think we all have earrings right now well hang on while grog goes and lifts the thing while grog does that do i have any idea where we are geographically in the city underground so probably not under the sun tree okay i touch another one pike come on guys no maybe if we all think about the strength of our friendship and bond together can we hear each other through the glass i'm going to go ahead and cast thunderwave maybe this shit can only be taken down with magic no it's just a push spell but it's radiant damage thing but you guys are behind the glass well if it breaks the glass we won't be separated by glass you wanted me to try and get us-- all right i take my staff crack it down cast thunderwave see if i can shatter this glass can i go ahead and start conjuring sunbeam okay no can i go ahead and on my-- i'm assuming i have spigots in my room we're each in individual rooms with our own spigots okay while they take out the gems these earrings work telepathically right okay i'm going to back into the corridor while you guys handle the gems and start talking to vax or the ramp whatever can i start talking to vax over the comms i start talking to vax vax it's kiki don't forget who you are you are stronger than this you are stronger than them you are not a briarwood you are vox machina and we can't lose you i can't lose you you're our only hope please you can overcome this please i couldn't take move earth because we needed sunbeam i have wall of stone do there appear to be any weak points in the metal anywhere the acid that's filling in melts that okay well that changes things does my control water spell would that work with the acid he rolled an 18 can i help her out hold on use your dagger and seeing what she's doing i'm going to cast my heat metal spell on it and start heating and melting it yeah we destroyed two how many gems are left inside i think going outside is a good idea go outside come on vex i'm going to switch my heat metal spell over to the other spigot oh okay still keeping my heat metal spell up fuck the one i was touching i'm going to put my hand on it and do-- i'm going to do another thunderwave bam see if i can thunderwave crack it they get killed by not a lot or a lot 11 points of damage okay out of frustration i see this can i do a wall of stone from underneath the glass to try and lift it up not great oh i get advantage on wisdom right fucking shit balls wisdom just wisdom eight bye 5th-level spell i've still got that heat metal up it's still up it's a concentration spell yeah scanlan what do you see on the other side of where you are we can't open the door throw a rope over to get over yeah i was just going to say fucking fuck you david tennant (laughter) rope wait that was on that empty barrel he didn't know who it was for oh percy it's true oh my god i still critical failed god it's cold in here jesus yeah mine are failing me fucking shit 16 do i have any geographical idea of where we are in the city is this located under the sun tree i'm damaged but-- i'm afraid they're marching him to his death we'll have to heal in battle if we need to what's the plan i tell pike real quick pike we are right under the sun tree which was dedicated to the god pelor this tree might end up being our best friend in this fight keep that in mind going forward yeah are they on good terms should we flank and go how many feet 50 to 60 feet probably out of the same glass bullshit see if he can stall tell him to stall we're flanking on the far side i'll go with grog guys thought for a second what if percy goes as a distraction percy goes first but they might be able to see through that use percy as bait while the rest of us go up that's why i said send in the real percy my heart is pounding we've got this does the building seem-- is it completely encased and they're already inside we have to stop them before they close these doors if they close the doors it's over percy go get their attention percy when i look up can i see the ceiling now can i see a root system of a really deep-running tree fuck okay okay as he's distracting them get in position try and stealth behind these buildings yeah it looks like there's pillars and shit yeah let's come in from the back i don't know what the gnomes are doing and i'm going to if i can peek around the corner start lighting up sunbeam they're in a nice pretty line and i like it it's hot (laughter) i have the shittiest fucking initiative rolls yeah so is mine nobody we all ate it fuck we don't get the drop on them because we were sneaking around a slight shimmer take this spoon taliesin and bitch oh boy can you help vax you're really close to vax bringing up the rears good roll oh that's right oh my god he rolled three sixes and a five what you going to do good thing you don't use strength oh god damn it what are you going to do come on grog you can hear all the dice he's picking up oh finally okay running up the stairs running up the stairs-- beautiful can i move to where i'm in a nice pretty line with a briarwood and cassandra over here and sunbeam right in a line i've been waiting 17 15 plus eight so that's 23 23 yes undead and oozes have disadvantage on saving throws and i don't know if this makes any amount of difference but for the duration of the spell i have a 30-foot radius sunlight glowing in my hand so it's bright in here now yeah it's a 30-foot radius with disadvantage he still crit how oh you-- yeah right 41 you're so far away yeah how many of those fuckers does he have he gets three every turn how are you he wants you he wants your bod he's got more where that came from though he's a very inspiring person knock her out me okay how close am i to sylas okay here's what i'm going to do seeing that sylas is distracted i'm going to run up and i'm going to put my hands on his back and i'm going to cast sunbeam through him and try and hit lady briarwood as well then i just hug him and i'm like (sings) let the sunshine in marisha laura travis and i'm trying to do a concentrated sunbeam i don't know if it's going to help balls fuck shit ten 25 total and i take my nails and dig them in a little bit hits oh wait hang on okay has to be over 12 right a saving throw 17 feral okay look at that sexy hand roll like you're percy yes of course high rolls big money no whammies it could be worse throwing bullets okay so i turn and i start shouting to the mist and i say what's the matter sylas afraid of a little gnome and a druid and i blast him with sunbeam thanks i'm not good with lines keyleth isn't good with lines are you afraid of us i heard percy try to do lines and i'm like that's what badasses do okay pike is standing right next to him i'm going to use pike and use the light that i have off pike and combine it to do a joint sunbeam holy bomb boom yeah i want him to eat a bag of holy dicks now explain that please make it sound great yeah way cooler i knew he'd bring it through high five pike yeah can i use my sunlight that i have up my staff can i go for a trip fine i'm going to bean her in the head natural 20 12 damage bam what's up pike not on me not today so he wouldn't disintegrate with it we have to find her she's somewhere close bigby gloves can i go up next i'll go who's up there right now me yeah good call we have ripley's gun are we running late it's fine crew hates us the orb is floating she splatters her blood on the dark sphere one can i try something am i able to try something is she still bleeding all over this orb while she does that-- it's not going to work but i can try okay so you could argue that our bodies are made of 70 percent water right so if i cast control water can i move her blood so wiping the blood off probably wouldn't work how good do you feel about a natural 20 well judging by the shit that's been going down today-- fuck it i already said it i'm going to do it i'm going to do control water and i'm going to see if i can suck all the blood off of the orb okay oh did you see that it was on a 20 15 no coup de grace at least distract her come on percy that was a 12 on a d12 which is dope no but you were at 76 taliesin marisha and can i cast hold person on her yes oh i can't hold her i thought you were going to die pike is it because we're in this fucking room i'm going for the black thing get her out of the room get out of the room what door is open she's already dead yes how many is she over you're touching her you're near her you're not going to die you're saved can i throw vax something real quick can i toss him something no before he runs that way can i toss you the immovable rod never mind i'm trying to get to this black hole i'm alone with the little ball aren't i okay i'm going to go up to it can i tell any type of magical properties from it from looking at it oh jesus oh that's good 19 total what is the net of dead bodies doing are they limp even outside of this building would my sunbeam still be up i pull out a piece of that green glass that we took from before i'm going to jam it into it that's a natural 20 nothing happened to it still just-- it's indestructible i can try and tear this whole building down i still have my elemental shape i can go earth elemental and start ripping this thing apart i think something was going to come through that orb okay everyone get out am i tearing this place down i'll stay behind being an earth elemental and ripping it apart i don't know if that's enough acid to take down and destroy a thing do we want to leave a spinning black hole of death under the city you guys go i'm going to tear it down i'll be okay i'll meet you there i stand at the top of the temple and i wait to see them go out of range vax go no go i concentrate for a minute and i go into the ground even beast shape never mind run (laughter) oh my god by one point and would become what thank god you took that fucking potion i think pike's playlist is up right now that won't work
