it was so hard to keep secret i guess i could go right-- on the critical role twitter and facebook right now download it @criticalrole it's done four hours specifically misti did a lot of our beauty makeup bianca did travis and heather did all of our ears because ears take a lot of time yes and she has an etsy store actually creature of habit on etsy so follow her on instagram and of course you can go-- she makes all these amazing flower crowns she's basically a real-life faerie it is a magical instagram creature of habit thank you bryan we love you and he's got a youtube channel mars rising which is great and i did a splinter cell guards sketch that i did with him a while ago oh that's awesome jon's awesome go check his stuff out she's a coat designer and pam did the photo of the wallpaper go follow her on instagram she's great you're appropriate for scanlan she's back that sounds better they're super soft to big lots yeah just a few cartloads we have transcended you guys i mean mainly because we ran out of time i heard a few things that seemed very desireable but some of us are still older right weird i don't think this is actually the time of day i don't think nature works the same around this temple kind of but it's always magic time of day i'm all right with that we could try and hoof it home i thought she was the one that he-- that's something we're going to have to restoration away you should really look at this as a nice peek into the future it's not bad so we are taking a short rest i'm going to burn a couple of hit dice what we do and we have some boar meat oh fuck no no you're lying pike is it the sword is it the sword while she does greater restoration i want to go over and-- -- grab the sword and see-- yeah actually can i do like a-- what why not wait what do you mean it spoke to you scanlan what should i do with this sword should i cast something through it to try and purge whatever it is out of it i can do like a sunbeam spell that's like a light spell i didn't bring anything because we decided to hoof it i didn't bring a transportation spell because we decided to walk has it been enough time i could cast an enhance ability spell that's true why is he taking a picture it's either really good or really bad this is bullshit are we sure it's him scanlan percy percy are we sure can i also do an insight check can i assist him or make an insight as well sorry 23 grog how many fingers am i holding up i think it's him all right how many more of us are going to die do you want to explain this grog no no no it was never your sword was it grog yes percy well what should we do with it we should get rid of it wait no we're not putting that in the bag of holding that sounds like a terrible idea however let me read something really fast pike knew about it as well wait how many people knew about this i might be able to banish it no i can do a more permanent version of that i've never tried it before and it's a 7th-level spell and i hate to be the one to point it out but i feel like you've been almost a little bit more brutal than you usually are here lately which is almost impressive it just killed you maybe a family heirloom i can attempt to plane shift this into another dimension what all has it told you grog well grog said he's been talking to it which makes-- it served its purpose you got its fair use you got your money's worth which was free like one of us you want to sacrifice your own leg for a sword and you were far powerful before the sword you killed lord briarwood without the sword the sword didn't make you grog all right should i attempt to banish this thing forever it's called plane shift i can shift it into its own little pocket dimension where it'll stay and nothing else can get to it all right so looking at plane shift it says you can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane but i can also transport eight willing creatures so can i hold the sword and attempt to plane shift it away ooh ooh ooh the pocket dimension of the green-eyed boy the golden-eyed boy yes it was empty it was his own dimension and he's dead what nothing i could easily send it to one of the nine hells where i'm sure someone would be very happy with the new gift they just found exactly yes but you forget that all these planes cross over we have fought many a demon i mean does anyone else have any better ideas where to send this thing that's true i mean it's its own little pocket it's at least blocked off that we know of i'm going to go for that dread emperor dimension and you do have this terrible habit of liking to push problems on other people wait you want to do greater restoration why it needs a wielder percy that's what i'm afraid of as well pike be careful pike let go let go before it-- let go of it it didn't attach itself to you now did it or anything i reach out and i plane shift it to the pocket dimension of the dread emperor i know how that spell works now that's nice oh my god we can get like a little kid leash for you it'll be like that scene in inception can i blow my last 5th-level spell to greater restoration somebody from their age who wants to go first no just one tonight the rest of y'all have to stay old all right come here vax yeah (laughter) (laughs) i'm going to put that aside i mean i could mist i could wind walk us do we want to wind walk it my 6th-level spell negative it's like a wizard thing i mean do you need to talk to dad oh again should we run ten well we should probably stop by and tell them that their problem has been handled why can't we stop by now they're right here we might as well pop in we'll forget if we don't do it now i know us it'll be three months before we come back and then we'll be like by the way-- let's just talk to them real fast okay we pop in we're like hey this is the first one it's like that scene in the second matrix it's next on the list dragons farewell cornelius no i'm good that guy's a weasel that was a gift i'm pretty sure it's a loaner it's on loan for the foreseeable future until we save the world and probably not kevdak well here's my question there's got to be hundreds of people still left in westruun it could take hours to evacuate a city of that size grog if someone kills kevdak say hypothetically you who takes control of the herd after that well then why do we need to evacuate the city if you could theoretically have control over it i have a feeling you're going to be the most attractive bait that we can think of we'll be nearby i think we won't need to worry about freeing the villagers if we can defeat kevdak i'm pretty sure all those things are actually true sure we can make you look as cool as you want that's undeniable pretty nice plus i mean it's like wearing really cool robes right scanlan you know there's nothing wrong with wanting to look cool but that was years ago right but you have to remember it's-- right yes pretty much what you said it's a city under siege under siege it's meta under siege under siege from the goliaths and then again from the dragons that's true they have wyverns who have been running patrol travis and but we haven't been hanging out over westruun no not at all but that's actually not a bad idea we're still outside the camp right how about this why don't we hike to the outskirts of westruun camp out the rest of the evening keep an eye out and just scout for a little bit i can be on the roofs nearby along with vex and percy doing range and i can do the hallucinatory terrain thing again it has been a while and i do love using that spell all right all right so we're going to hike to the outskirts of westruun 32 19 what maybe it's a matter of respect percy i think they already knew we were here we do this tonight they don't know we're here it could be anyone who could've cut him down why would they suspect us i would suspect the village people first did we not just learn anything let's go can i also spend some time practicing a protection from energy potion i do not enough to where i can't you know sleep but just you know protection from energy is a 3rd-level spell (musical tone) all right okay percy and i strategize i think it starts right now sure yeah yeah yes i can dig a trench pretty quickly honestly if we want to go the trench route is that we were thinking i could theoretically dig the trench possibly without anybody noticing like tunnel underground and just tunnel it out and maybe even you know leave like a thin layer of dirt possibly i dunno maybe like dig dug exactly the same thing that's what i'm saying and i could possibly maybe carve it thin enough to where when they run over it it'll collapse well i was also hoping oh and explode it as they run by-- also if we could maybe have something fancy at the bottom of it to you know finish them off yeah i thought the trench was to thin the herd literally i mean it could also further instill grog being powerful and undead with him right like he's a necromancer yes moe this is also george foreman these three guys are also george foreman all right give me a little bit of time to dig a ditch we're not going to worry about that no they don't care scanlan can you do it with an illusion instead of an actual physical person just an illusion it could make theoretical sense if you're still undead stonejaw because you know decomposition i'm sure shrinks you a little bit while you guys figure it out i'm going to start digging a trench no no no i'm good i'm good you stay i don't want to blow our cover i'm going to do this all underground so outside of the city i'm going to start digging underground and i'm going to start digging a trench i'm moving earth i'm going to go underground and it lasts up to two hours i want to go underground and tunnel towards-- and do-- and i want to make it really thin to where there's a nice thin layer of earth and then i want to make it really deep uh-huh and i can concentrate on a 40-square-foot for ten minutes and each ten minutes i can change it yeah yeah so real deep i want to make sure it's wide enough to cover the whole entrance as well uh-huh underground i rolled a 19 and i have a stealth of 11 okay 180 feet that'll do and i can make the ground thin enough to where it's not going to support weight yeah ah jeez louise ooh 19 cool cool cool cool did i get a little black powder from you can i put a little black powder in the top of the dirt whatever he gave me so i pepper it in the top where if it gets hit it's going to go boom maybe it works maybe i don't know okay okay can you be a floating head inside of a hamster ball well he can be on a roof with the hat with your hat i mean theoretically we'll be stationed throughout and we'll have our earpieces correct i also have both of my beast shaping still so i can always fly in and evac you let's do it can we get a pass without a trace while we all get to our positions i could give us a fog cloud i've already burned it i mean we can still go underground i have a tunnel built to a certain point yeah everyone be mindful of the pit i point it out to everyone where the pit is so we can go around it i can polymorph a couple people no sorry i can polymorph one person as a stealth kind of deal do we want to get up on the wall there's like a wall right around the city he really is a really fast walker i cast polymorph on percy and turn him into a crow also i use my beast shape to go into a crow (crow noise) (crow noise) and we fly to the walls and perch on opposite sides on the entrance (crow noises) but you're scanlan you can do this oh shit why do we even bother to plan i spent a 6th-level spell building that trench it had better come in handy
