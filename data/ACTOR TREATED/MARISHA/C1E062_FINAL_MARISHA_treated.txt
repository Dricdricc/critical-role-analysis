what i think you were the only one who got the shitty end of that deal wait there's a river really okay it's okay 18 or i could part the sea i'm going to take my staff and i want to feel how deep it is i thought we were there it's a lot going on and it looks like a long river i don't think we did okay let's go save our friends i didn't say i was trying to leap across the people who are in the water are they being dragged under we can just not see them anymore yeah percy percy why does everything here hate us percy aw (laughter) grasping vine is a bonus action yo wait no it is sorry so the river doesn't hate magic all right i'm going to cast control water where do i see percy is percy and vax together vax is or percy okay so first i'm going to control water i'm going to stop the flow of current and see if i can get it to burp out percy i'm going to burp the river no okay yeah wait what just a straight wisdom i just spent a lot of money on these dice today oh a 15 i rolled a one grog grab percy grab percy ten-sider can i try again with the current it's a concentration spell up to ten minutes even the water's angry (screams) okay that's better straight wisdom a saving throw or just a check 16 no we haven't even gotten started there's like 50 more creeks in front of us it's a river of impulses such an allegory for so many things i didn't learn mist form today does it look like all the rivers are connected he's fine if bigby's hand had about ten seconds left i've got about nine minutes left on this control water spell why don't we try and move as fast as possible along with the chain and maybe the immovable rod let's go you guys go first and i'm going to try and halt the flow no it's another fucking one useless i spent so much money on these percy don't touch my dice percy i do but i can only cast that on myself we can use mist form sorry there's teleport via plants which i did not bring today i brought control water grog dimension door i could potentially turn us into animals that can swim which is why i was wondering if the rivers were connected maybe we can jump like salmon going upstream i can and i did bring move earth as well as wall of stone to be totally honest i am terrified of messing with the ground i'm afraid if i move the earth it will eat me it will split open and swallow me i could try it they're magical rivers why didn't we think of that hey grog remember when we almost died because i picked a flower just throwing it out there of the control water all right let's do this can i try and stop the current once again 300 feet okay calm waters calm oh my god i am not giving you all that dice (laughter) it's a fucking one for the third time in a row we all get ropes that's acceptable 22 keyleth's got angry tears of frustration in the back as she's trying to control the water runny eyeliner like it's 2001 fuck you no it's a 19 total 19 i'm sorry just go that's a really big catfish i didn't mean to do that i was really nervous

river good boy acrobatics or athletics 15 20 shut up really i don't think that's ever happened before that's never happened yeah because it didn't happen last time so it has roots it appears to be plant-based okay i'm going to go a little risky here i'm going to cast speak with plants dumb idea yeah sure but he appears to be fellow kin i've done this before with talking to the treant what if i cast at a higher level would that help well i cast it so i'm going to say hey you spit that out of your mouth right now mister (laughter) seven where am i oh i see where i am can i move towards that tree away from the river that also wants to eat us okay yeah all right cool done go have you told many people that she couldn't do it anymore hide behind his uvula grog can we assist come on big money

crocodile's mouth now you're tripping man you're frightened oh no it's a bad trip son of a bitch oh shit no i thought i attacked kill it garmelie oh it's me oh dear god okay i am going to do what worked really well last time and i'm going to do a 4th-level blight and what i want to do is i want to take my staff because i'm near him right okay i want to take my staff and where pike put that nice little crispy donut hole in the middle of him i want to take my staff right in the middle and bring it down and cast blight that's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me my ego loves this is percy still in his mouth okay i'm going to say stop putting foreign objects in your mouth it takes hold okay how about this you know the petrified forests in arizona can i petrify him hey percy how's the weather up there thanks keyleth wants to get down on the grass that she hurt and i want to cast druidcraft and heal it and talk to the grass and be like it wasn't personal i hope you know you were not the intended target you just happened to be caught in the fray it's okay don't be mad i like your enthusiasm grass i get a souvenir from the feywild that's all i wanted i'm in yeah do it three-point landing i'm left okay you want to shot put this one okay hut no fuck that new dice nine not great i gag a little try to keep it down try to wash my face if i can you're committed now bye are we in the bog now i want to test and see if we sink when we step on the bog it comes to a stop i could rest and learn mist and we can mist across that was what i was going to say oh my god it's a 31 i give him a-- from a distance i give him a-- 24 but we're only 80 yards out feet 80 feet total this is not the tree we're looking for the whole time us who were waiting have been do-si-do-ing around each other we don't stop moving so we're dancing in circles the pixies and fairies haven't been that nice it's a bonding trip i think you find her charming i find her charming too but it doesn't mean that other people might we're still doing a do-si-do by the way while we're having this conversation is there a nearby tree that i can climb into yeah i get into a vantage point i get up into a tree and while they go do their recon i want to cast commune with nature yes do i sense a cancerous tree in the area yeah i'm not asking the tree northwest okay so i can safely assume that the tree that they're heading towards is not cancerous i'm meditating then can i get a general lay of the land and sense running water and rivers so we can avoid those oh okay for my last question can i get a sense on any big evil things that might want to kill us everything more specific that i won't screw it up are there twinkies are there any more large crocodile dudes living under the-- i don't know any more large things living under the swamp yes under the swamp well wherever just blanket it does the tree in front of us count as a corrupted plant life entity and none of the pixies that live in there are showing up on my radar as bad this place sucks it's so sad the trees are so sad a little bit of both they're fine (laughter) i think vex might be right was she really tall do you know if she was tall that is true oh no (laughter)
