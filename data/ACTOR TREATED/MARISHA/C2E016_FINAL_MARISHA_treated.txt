that guy knew way too much about everything lost them yasha can though wait maybe if we show it the sword he'll chill out where's that corkscrew thing that's better 16 wait we have the book that we found in the research center it says from ashes i shall rise again i can't get a reaction from it as it goes fuck i'm going to run over to this bookcase and put my staff behind it to see if i can knock it over fuck that keeps happening six i guess so can i give her some assistance smoke grenade that's awesome mushroom cloud that was great i've got a little bit of oil i'll give you a little bit of a therapeutic temple rub while i'm at it what is that 600 700 are you counting ash i've never seen so many people happy for a natural one bring the art out too they're like we didn't anticipate this rich people love fancy art yeah while all of this is going on beau wants to be going through some of these books that were on the shelf that we knocked over i'm going to do a tour of the urns and see if there's anything jewelry or something hidden in there 21 can i do a little flip through of it can i use a ki point to get advantage i'll mark that down really quick i'll take that 11 over that two 13 they tried to burn it i walk over to caleb hey caleb found this sure i think it's got stuff for you in it that's unfortunate actually sure covered in oil and ash you've got like a section to take notes now necromancers but a great sword took his legs yeah that's why he had no feetsies he actually didn't have feet he lost his legs hmm i don't know yeah yeah give me a damn ring beau leans over caleb's shoulder what are you reading yeah that's cool who's the publisher is that first print first edition i recognize a few of those symbols you know magic shit the gentleman just wanted us to kill shit right he wanted us to-- did you find it did he want us to bring back something or just clear it out i thought he said he wanted us to bring the expensive good shit but we can keep whatever else maybe some of the art they love old things if we say it belonged to a dead person they love it even more we'll each take a ring we'll each take one ring maybe we can give him that research notebook we found you keep the spellbook we give him the research notebook we already know what was in it i say we keep the sword do we have to go back out through the river to get out of here which means we're going to have to pass right back through the gentleman's place it's not like we're going to be able to lie i wonder where it goes what do we remember about the crawling king do you know anything did you say you rolled a one you rolled a one another one well i think this information about the teleportation-y circle situation could be useful leverage if he wants to try and take that sword off of your back i say we keep this teleportation a secret unless he tries to start bargaining for shit not unless he asks that's what we're saying how did you forget we got that i have one i think we have mushrooms well it's eight cubic square feet yeah it's magical i still like yasha's idea just slip it up your back robe all right let's go they worship some weird shit who knows what dark corners of the world it goes to we're going to start with just trying to give him the rings and the art right rings art shit-- keep everything else laura and we could do a scout boat maybe one boat stays behind the other scouts it out separate the party taliesin and i'll check it out it's our boat our boat scouts i use my staff to help navigate jester-- taliesin and i light a torch we're back to the fork we're going down that other path right can i get a little bit closer i can poke i'm going to take my staff and jab it behind there see if there's anything there's always shit behind waterfalls i think we should can i help her push off will it go anywhere though this is the end of it it's stuck in the chamber ugh gross molly you know people are going to start-- how easy is it to get back down here though he is very wet explain that joke explain it the research journal the research one what was it written in caleb if you're done with that book do you think i could hold on to it yeah i'd love to thank you (singing) more bad dreams crack into a kraken i do a few push ups to get warmed up yeah some squats it's true you need more than one example got to find that average like a satyr like in those ancient greek paintings oh big tusks does he have a cool lip tattoo couldn't afford a root canal my childhood damage-- insight check i hate it when that happens 800 it's nine it's 1000 children are assholes i mean it's how we see you yeah i mean we're too distracted with our own personal damage then we bribe him with the information on the teleportation circle sure yeah oh

there was this floor with this relief in it of these two faces and fjord put some coins in it it opened up and he collapsed and fell in a pit it was super fun no we stayed up all night trying to get

to caleb here you go that was awesome we have those chains we could-- we found a dead guy in chains do you think that people are going to start being suspicious of us if we keep selling magical manacles the same blacksmith let him know that horris is out of town several dead people especially molly and i as we're walking i lean over to fjord and i go something's been bothering me the gentleman said that it was ulog that arranged and leaked the information to the xhorhasian assassins what would be his motive for doing that if he only really cared about getting his wife free or at least revenge for his wife i hope so feels like a big task for one person how would he have those connections yeah we could enter in a contest and fight for the harvest festival right yeah maybe there's prize money or something i like fighting people for fun yeah that's it (singing) hide your kids hide your wife hey where do we sign up for the victory pit tell me you know we had a long-ass night with advantage what am i doing intimidation 14 she is not a child there's a rec center community service-- thanks it's all you had to tell me i liked her sell shit sign up for the victory pit

hoods and our boring cloaks just a saving throw 20 i've got such cottonmouth mmm what happens if you have a childhood but it's barely a childhood because it was supposed to be someone else's childhood but it was you instead is that a childhood is that why i have cotton mouth ah goddamn it well i saw this goatman and he told me just don't eat the yellow snow and you'd be okay this is definitely not a safe substance i still have half a dose i think it would be real funny to plant it on somebody and get them busted later don't judge me blood flow she's fine she's pregnant she's not dead (whispering) hide yo wives i'll wake up in the morning early after my drug hangover and make my way quietly quite a headache coffee the bacon that i had in my pocket from yesterday i head to the cobalt reserve sorry the cobalt soul branch in zadash i'll see if i can find dairon sup hey is dairon in just find dairon thank you just go find dairon talk in private bye xenoth just want to let you know i'm in town and busy is that good or bad i don't know it's hard to read you you don't think the two could be mutually exclusive or best of both worlds hey no that i'm back and i'm dedicated i figured showing up would be good you know do you have time my kind of woman let's go obstacle course i tell her about the xhorhasian spies and the terrorist that we encountered does she seem like she knew that knowledge or not they said they were looking for an artifact something that the wizards here had stolen something that they said furthered their bloodline and made sure that they furthered their population i don't know do you know anything about it why else would they attack the tower if they weren't looking for something specific i never said i show pity i wanted to know what the hell this artifact was that they were after figured you here at the cobalt soul would know we wouldn't have any records on some xhorhasian artifact that apparently keeps them alive all right all right thank you dairon what this bloodgarden in the northeast side well i still have a lot of training so come back alive i guess sure i go back and join the rest yeah it's the luck feat all over again
