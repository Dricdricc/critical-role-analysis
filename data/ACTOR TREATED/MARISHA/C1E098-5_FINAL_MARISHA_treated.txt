i wonder how many people are going to lose money on us tonight table right yeah that would have been great to have then mm-hm so clutch mr loot-drop over here exactly where the ranger should be four so about 50 feet up 16 four are you at the top of the tower too as part of this round we what is that a hut is that what those are shit it's like a paintball arena oh god it begins can i just run up and just check that water right in front of me and really fast put my foot in it and see if i can see how deep it goes let me take my staff and just put my staff down a little bit it's pretty deep oh i touch the bottom now though okay i'm going to cast freedom of movement on myself and then can i move around to this side here-ish this side here-ish over here and hide that's fine you're going to be a guy in a hamster ball being carried around by robot it's pretty awesome is it totally invulnerable type of shit so wait but you can't cast spells out either if i was an air elemental could i go into the sphere just conjecturing yeah but i'm a breath of fresh air oh my god me too that's kind of true ten rounds that's a long fucking time okay question the radius of the (energy field sound effect) i have freedom of movement do i seem to not be affected by that cool i'm going to move up and forward this direction yeah one two three stop right there do i see doty i can move one more square correct okay move me up to the doorway up one more that's good to know i'm going to on top of doty cast a 5th-level flaming sphere he's prone 18 20 21 22 22 and then-- i don't get any other bonuses okay i'm going to say sorry tary and then go (whoosh) and go fire elemental form and hope that this isn't a mistake wouldn't hurt me none can i do any more movement with my elemental form i'm going to pop into the room throwing up the wine you drank earlier i have to make a wisdom saving throw i've got crazy high wisdom 22 is he not affected by the gravity thing i look to see if he's going to keep going okay know where grog is is there any windows in this little shack that we're in or-- no bars or cracks or crevices no fuck that okay i'm going to move out-- sorry i'm going to go up to trinket over here can i get into trinket's space well let me do my attack first i'm going to be like good job with the ball buddy shh go to sleep go to sleep we'll make it less painful for you we'll make this very painless go to sleep i'm sorry i just can't have you messing stuff up right now that's true i'm trying to smoke him out first 15 for the first one natural 20 for the second i get to reroll ones i also get an extra d6 for my fire hands and then i double die roll right 14 15 so 30 plus 33 fire damage and then i'm going to use my bonus action to turn over and take my flaming sphere and go (whoosh) and ram tary again doty sorry 19 20 those don't count it's fine that's not great i can reroll that one two four six eight 11 points of fire damage sorry sorry guys i'm going to take my other 25 feet of movement that i have left to go back into the-- 50 i go back inside for cover i'm sorry for beating up trinket yeah vex is mad at me that would be so fucked up (laughs) that's so true it's so true oh oh shit no way you are lying if he gets sucked into a random void i imagine that would be considered defeat oh shit so much just happened okay i'm going to turn around and be like (screams booming) on both of these guys i'm going to move into vex's space and then attack grog (bam bam) correct 15 second one much better that hits 16 plus six is 22 oh i'm attacking grog that's 20 fire damage the first time it enters a creature's space on a turn that creature takes 1d10 fire damage and catches fire five for vex and four for grog oh on that first one again nope this is going to hurt okay is that halved because it's bludgeoning no his weapon's magical yeah when he attacks me he takes another 1d10 damage sorry i'm an asshole eight okay i'm going to back out and around again through the room do i have any more yeah let me go out one more and onto this lip next to trinket and i'm going to take my bonus action to take my flaming sphere and i want to jump it over this shallow end on this far side i've got cameras right in front of me it can jump over a ten-foot gap 30 can it get ten more feet over to the edge if it looks like it's not going to land in the acid and extinguish it or something weird would it extinguish it then i'll keep it there on the edge yeah i'll take that 16 what do i have to get over so he did 25 damage so yeah i'm good snitch is failing you tonight you're close though (heavy breathing) okay vex is flying i'm going to take my bonus action go ahead and get this out of the way first to get my flaming sphere over that gap and ram it into trinket i'm a druid i'm sorry i feel bad about this six 12 18 22 damage okay i still have my full movement right you could roll a natural 20 and save it i'm going to haul ass do i have enough movement if i dash or whatever to get into that building yeah (counting) yeah i'll try it i'm not going over water man can i peek in cool oh right oh my god okay i'm going to use my action to expend a level-2 spell slot to heal myself with my spell slot to heal myself in wild shape thing i can't use my action i'm basically wasting an action to do it instead okay where are my d8s here they are that's not great i heal nine hit points in my form thanks man i'm glad you're so approving come on fire pillars come on yeah that's not a bad roll yeah not bad yeah might keep you alive oh buddy no he's a fucking barbarian does he take any damage that's just grog putting his finger in the socket wait are you rolling damage how did that happen going to hold down the fort you're looking down the barrel man so fucking nonchalant like he doesn't know he can still hit you if you run so you could theoretically recover and come back and the sound of the first cannon and he's still on fire right okay i saw vex shooting percy okay 20 no 21 okay so i don't see anyone okay i am going to start by moving my fire ball jeez there's not a lot i can do i saw grog run by as well correct i'm going to move out and around on this side my movement over here i'm going to go ahead and use my bonus action to heal a little bit more actually no can i use my action to heal like last time and use my bonus action to move my sphere i'm going to do 1st-level five okay and then i'm going to move my sphere right in front of the doorway yeah however far it can go do i have any more movement i'll pop back in the building a little bit and that's it that hits okay (grunts) going to go ahead and drop my fire elemental form it's looking pretty rough now hope i don't fuck that up and i'm going to peek around the corner and i can see vex a little up on the tower don't fuck me gil don't fuck me oh that's good 29 i'll be like (yelling) your blue feather is very pretty against the stonework i yell it through the earring and it deafens her a little bit (yelps) ow feedback and i'm going to take my spire of conflux and just to be sure i'm going to call a fire storm down and blanket the tower and i want to go down a little bit so here's what i want i want this rain fire down everywhere because i don't know where tary is i haven't seen him in a while it's a fire waterfall well my spell dc is 20 i get to reroll ones do you have one more 7d10 no ones but it's a pretty good roll (counting) 26 (continues counting) 52 was tary in there at all fuck and i'm going to take my bonus action i know grog ran vaguely in this direction so i'm going to take my 30 feet of movement of my flaming sphere and move it toward that tower that grog is towards yeah is that 30 feet and then i'm going to pop back into cover hug against the wall did you ever hunter's mark me oh yeah i'm good i rolled a natural 19 with my modifier right with my bonus yeah i'm good nope don't have any more of those oh god i don't know what to do okay all right fucking hell okay fuck fuck what am i going to do if i do a fire storm around there can i also call on the inside of the room as well yeah fuck it let's do that again pop out once again from the spire (war cry) coming down i only did it once so that's seven so that brings me to another seven so i have six points left in the spire yeah and because i heard grog run in that area too i'm just lighting up that tower that was one of my dice i re-roll ones okay i rolled two tens so that's 20 two eights so that's 36 41 44 one two three four five six 44 plus seven is 51 one two three four five six seven 7d10 for my bonus action i want to bring my flaming sphill to block this doorway that i'm in front of yep okay and then i want to move back and fuck around here on the outside and hide did you get where i said i want to go on this side of the building to use for cover perfect and then i don't have anything else i can do do i that's it can i also hide fuck i hope that wasn't a mistake is anyone still on fire like grog another ten i know i look fucking crazy fuck did i get hit okay oh my god this is so scary i do have that thing i can do yeah that kill everyone spell it's time it's time i am going to thinking of the acidy black pit in front of us and remembering umbrasyl i am going to turn into an adult black dragon (war cry) full werewolf transformation and i burn my shapechange i hope i don't die i can move right so how deep is this watery pit does it go pretty deep i am going to as a dragon see how far i can get i'm going to go black dragon who can swim and is immune to acid i'm going to go (heavy footsteps) and see if i can lay underneath the surface of the acid nope that's true a little biased i mean i could accidentally trip over him and kick him into the pool with me if you really want me to that's it you can't see me question sorry before we move too far are people affected by my frightful presence within 120 feet those who are aware of me once i (heavy footsteps) and then go in 120 feet wisdom saving throw shit what kind of a saving throw that's true come on acid well they're big fatty dragons not great seven poison 34 a lot oh that's a natural 19 i have advantage okay i'm under the acid man i poke my head out do i see anything okay 21 cool i've got a good idea i'm going to fly up how high is the tower (stutters) i've got a flying speed of 80 feet so i'm going to go 40 feet up i look at him and i say in draconic because i always forget i go grog check it out grog look i'm going to be like sorry but i've always wanted to do this (vomit noises) and do an acid breath 60-foot line five-foot wide i'll roll five and then i'll roll five more actually give me one more and i'll roll twice get that out of there yeah 16 plus let's do these two twos which is four which brings us to 20 plus another 12 so that brings us to 32 and then i roll again 32 plus another 14 which is going to be 46 plus three which is 49 plus another six which is 55 plus another eight and another seven 55 plus-- 70 total acid damage do you have one hit point left or some shit the fire's out which is ironic because that means at the top of your turn you could have theoretically died with the remainder of my movement-- i still have more movement can i go oh fuck in draconic and go (boop) right back underneath the acid i have an 80 fly speed he doesn't have anything fighting against three-quarters cover are you still invisible i'm like a florida alligator right now fuck nope i think that's the exact same thing i rolled last time don't fuck me gil don't fuck me that's good that's even better 24 just hide yeah you're called a dirty camper a camper like someone who camps in first-person shooters oh you dick you dick (laughter) i'll get a cake from porto's tary versus many horrible things what about his weapons and all of this shit too what really that one automatically succeeds at something bring it bitch that's true that's how many fingers you have grog lives in intervals of fives did he get something stupid he's going to the bag grog becomes cavalry okay i'm going to come back out of the acid (war cry) what do i see i look towards where grog was (war cry) i'm going to fly over and i'm going to land on top of the tower and i'm going to do a multiattack against him (heavy impacts) and frightful presence i don't know if that affects an imaginary knight from a deck of cards yep bite and two claws that's a natural 19 on the first one so that's 30 not so good on the second one that's 15 okay and then on the third that's a seven plus 11 so 18 so two attacks so one bite and one claw i guess 2d10 plus six plus 1d8 for acid damage oh man why does this keep happening to me okay 11 plus seven is 18 wait let me make sure i'm doing this right no plus six 11 plus six so 17 and then 1d8 four okay so he takes 18-- wait what did i just say 17 piercing damage and then four acid damage from the bite eight plus six is 12 12 damage okay can i take the rest of my movement to fly and hover above that's fine would i get out of the sphere of the electrical attack then no i'll just stay there does he get a retaliation attack yeah you didn't roll high enough oh that's not that great i thought that was better 15 goddamn it 15 a lot i'm good he's immune to fear because barbarian and raging he ain't scared to hit yeah he could take me down damage yeah oh right total as long as i roll over-- oh constitution my constitution's all right i've been rolling over the minimum anyway no nope why were you like ugh you wanted a critical damage total he doesn't get to attack does he yeah so 23 total matt and yeah grog we're friends right remember me come here i'm going to grab him real quick and i'm going to do plane shift it's me keyleth (grunts) the 20 is what i had you are lying to me you are fucking lying i have a bonus and a movement okay oh god yeah it was bad i'm still all right i have a bonus and a movement okay i'm going to take my bonus action to go oh grog and cast a grasping vine fuck okay i will do options are dwindling very quickly i have freedom of movement still on me though does that aid me escaping okay i'm going to do a bonus action to heal myself healing word let's do a 3rd-level healing word sorry you're right 2nd-level healing word so it's 2d4 oh my god 53 okay and then i'm going to-- fucking hell i'm really tapped out okay my mantle allows me to jump my jump distance is tripled does that mean i could successfully back up and jump off the tower and potentially land safely how about this i'm going to go sorry grog and turn and run and i'm going to do a full-on ninja-style jump and see if i can land on top of this roof parkour yeah just six six from the knight okay that puts me at 46 do i have advantage on this i'm so bad at my athletics i'm always so bad 12 ugh i fucking twisted my ankle how much four points what the fuck kind of cone are you using even though i'm down from them tary wins dexterity saves oh that's good i am at 20 that saving throw may be the only thing that saves me maybe depends on how he rolls i'm good shut your dirty mouth goddamn it he was so close i had him twice i had you twice time for a beautiful and glorious death i almost teleported his fucking ass i'm unconscious (laughing) so cold look strength check i got to use the tattoo if tary wins i'm going to be so happy even though dirty fucking camper dirty camper this is your fault oh you almost tripped in the acid that would have been awesome damn it would have been so cool i know i'm still laughing at him saying that at the top 19 that 19 will haunt me for forever wait what all right i just thought if you cast it as a higher-level spell you couldn't do it as a lower-level spell if you land in the acid dude-- i love that he's getting so cranky about rolling natural 19s or 15 more seconds he's undead you're getting him with a greatsword oh my god he's still fucking alive dc 25 he's going to make it water plane water dimension you would have just drowned i didn't know your charisma was-- i thought you had zero all he had to roll was an 18 or lower anything else the one that i was in for a lot of the time it was the one i was camping out in i almost thought about taking it just so no one else could have it but never got to it level 20 keyleth is nasty i get unlimited shapechange i thought i was going to take the light down yeah i thought that's what he was going to fucking do i can't believe that you would have bamfed and then it would have been down to tary and i yeah you could have died 80 times you pulling that knight probably changed things because he did just enough damage to me to make it a pain in the ass two clerics that's right kash and i was the runner-up with pike too goddamn it i wasn't the runner-up tonight you jammed all of your guns i can't believe you jammed all of your guns how did you do that
