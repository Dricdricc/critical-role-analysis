i look forward to all the voicemails - yeah yeah i'll put it on my white car (laughter) you guys want to say anything you didn't say anything this time do you want to say how much you love everybody - yeah - i head back into the chamber and see if i can find any of like raishan's scales or like raishan blood or i'll watch from a distance and make sure that you know it's not boiling over - yeah yeah - that really sucks i want to assume that was karma -yeah - i feel really bad for that duergar now that sucks that's a rough way to go (laughter) okay - lay on hands lay on hands same - yeah my new besty - kerr keyleth just closes the distance and runs up and just hugs kerr what are you doing here i got your gift it meant everything - maybe even a little too literally like-- like 20 minutes ago a lot of passing through fire here lately i sky write up in the air is there like a-- like a sigil of emon like a-- i do that into the sky with sky write she's lying okay call the locksmith i just-- i grab kerr and i start ushering him down into the hole into the hole great time for a personal crisis great timing yes that was his turn -yeah - ooh i rolled a natural 19 - so that's 29-- no 30 total yeah are there any signs around scanlan as-- okay i pick up the pipe since i recognize what-- that's where the scent is coming from can i like do an investigation check or something if i can put together what's going on fifteen - yeah guys i feel like this was a classic scanlan in terms of choices i don't think anyone did this i'm gonna start kind of like like kinda can i start seeing if i can find whatever he put in this pipe eleven hey vex-- vex look i-- i think he did something i think he-- he tried something look and see if you can find what might be-- what he might have put in this pipe i take the pipe sorry the flute scanlan why would you be asking if this is a hallucination just curious huh no no no i'm too-- can i do an insight check on him twenty-two and it is us so you're not calling this a failure what - as vax walks back i kind of pull him aside and i say you ran in after me this is-- partially on me as well us all of us i guess ♪ kerr i--i tried to be the hammer that you said i needed to be and i don't know-- i don't know oh no that was a pretty great letter i feel like i focus so much on just my want for revenge and justice against raishan that i made it so personal that i forgot that this isn't about me it's ultimately not about any of us there's something so much bigger going on here and ♪ maybe my onus and guilt was in some way selfish i don't-- i don't know ♪ i admire your wisdom - i do would you be willing to lend at least a little bit of your knowledge to help us maybe find raishan well you know that was a pretty good summary actually yeah she knew far more about us the whole time than we ever knew about her and that's still the case yes j'mon before you leave if you were fighting a green dragon named the diseased deceiver who wanted ultimate power over her domain where would you start i'm at 30 i kinda fell in a pit of lava yeah i just-- keyleth just bursts into tears she just start-- i'm so tired i'm so tired i do the same to kerr i justmy eyes why am i so cold yeah i have 118 max so yeah i'm gonna burn a few hit dice as well oh yeah you'd be like climbing no no you wish naturally jesus christ that would be perfect yeah you can't really destroy magical items though right i'm with kerr in the hall right you have this conviction to your voice that's just--i believe you 50 gold 50-- 50000 gold i was asking the same question it's considered a scimitar seventy nine she collects magical carpets ah is it a bigger tapestry it's a california king version can you be like a silver surfer thing ya vex does it look like our old carpet does it looks like they were maybe in the same family - yeah they do look druidish do they look druidish - okay ♪ five these are so pretty - oh my gosh okay i'll look at these later i well the soles are a little melted now sounds like that japanese rpg (cross talk) i think also i think keyleth's hair would probably be shorter now again thanks to the fire again that's real bad - that's pretty bad do you see anything from greyskull in there all right i was gonna say people are gonna have to pull papers very matter of factly gems yeah--gems for heroes feasts are always good yeah - yes someone trustworthy i see kerr hesitate and i bend down and i pick up like a handful of gold and say i'm taking a little bit of gold for myself just 'cause i'm low that's what i did with 500 but that's our loot that's not the city's the clasp should be aware of that well we can i'm sure we can still throw them a little bit of platinum but i mean percy-- well percy you once said that every good city needs a good underbelly i imagine that the underbelly would also have a vested interest in a having good city i imagine it works both ways right yeah thank you i'm learning from you just like a little -where it's appropriate - only where it's appropriate you literally said different numbers every time we also just saved their city from utter destruction why don't we just hand this over to someone else and let them handle it regardless i agree with grog we have more important things to worry about right now things never been said before we have a hand we have a lot to do i can try and scry with the scrying eye but that's it yeah i can try to scry on rai-- did i find a little like a scale of hers by the way that's slightly better uh ten total anything blood yeah that'll do it yeah i can try to scry on her and maybe get lucky or i can try and scry on whitestone the problem is is she's smart so even if i try and scry on her there's a possibility that she'll resist it she did burn all of her legendary resistance -didn't she - i'm gonna try and scry on raishan scrying eye i guess so but i don't know if you ever put the scrying eye dc on here it doesn't have a dc my spell save dc is 20 she's not in whitestone us and with the aid of many others of course allura is safe is whitestone currently we can say whitestone now right - okay -she's safe in whitestone - whitestone yeah it's kinda nice saying it again asum should still be here as well right - also back in whitestone yeah - raishan brought asum back to us - and kima's in there she's kind of guarding the treasury if you will - solo by herself i fill them in on what i saw in scrying more importantly what this means is that she is on this plane of existence i can't scry if she's on another plane so she's here i could attempt to think really hard about it i could attempt to think can i do like a--can i do a roll to see-- - oh geez thanks for your vote of confidence sam that's not good that's not good - this is your fault -it's a five total - wait wait wait no just a straight intelligence check - yeah it's five i turned to pike and asked-- and tell her of the island and ask if she has encountered anything like this in her travels big nothing but ocean except for that one singular island it looked like there was geothermal activity going on so it must be near a volcano or something nothing like that it's okay pikey don't die - southern southern ozmit sea yes - holy shit holy shit oh my god you just saved us a trip to the library - wait what was that last part that was really important banish the necromancer -out to sea - who was banished to sea - you guys--you're all-- we have such smart friends oh my goodness well you know we have-- we have a paladin of the raven queen and from what i remember the raven queen hates necromancers maybe she knows maybe you could talk to her i'm sure they're out there - and she's also very familiar with i'm sure whatever the briarwoods were doing and with whatever the ziggurat is on the bottom of whitestone that we still don't know what it's technically for - i bet she does is gilmore still around - yeah - you've got a little you've got a little something hopefully a good thing how does it work - conjure some wine in your jug - back to the runechild thing - what's that about like scoliosis - sure - gilmore in your time in growing up on marquet did you ever hear any tale of someone named opesh - he's a necromancer - how much longer do you think raishan will stay there especially if she's not finding what she's looking for - she didn't seem to notice a lot of times you can kinda tell - she seemed distracted - yeah i could get us to-- back to whitestone using my last seventh level spell and then that's it i'm done done done - no transport via plants it lasts six seconds - i think my record was like 25 people when we were moving refugees through yeah it was pretty good still trying to break that we gotta find a tree - we do have a tree at the keep if we wanted to make a stop at the keep what they said just like decking children - how's the garden look - okay anybody need anything six seconds go go go should find allura and cassandra is it soon it feels like we've been-- at least two weeks (sighing) (laughing) that's true like a holiday break happened we're not dead oh yeah this is ker - my hair is still singed short again you still have an eighth level spell (laughing) you're going full heisenberg - what the fuck oh my god oh my god how big are these fucking bathtubs - i'm working on something is that where those water-breathing potions -have gone to - marquet yeah - i mean i feel like - i feel like the giant green dragon in the room is pretty urgent um raishan is still at large and we have discovered that we think she is on the island of opash when did you tell us that information of viscon lucidian ocean my favorite she seemed to be poring through tomes and books looking for something she seemed very frustrated question--oh go ahead exactly allura if we scried on this island if you saw it again would you recognize it oh i thought you said i wanna confirm if she actually is on the island of viscar--viscon but she would still see the same thing that i would-- that i would've seen -it wouldn't confirm the island - i could try and scry on viscar--viscon right if i know enough about viscon i could try and scry on a location correct find the path yeah - if i scry on the island she won't notice - it's only if i scry on her i could look-- - would i - if i--if i scried on viscon could i recognize yeah this looks like the similar island all right - last fifth-level spell of the day (cross talk) you should try it - it's so tasty - see i told you see was wise the fire has passed through you (laughing) it's gonna go all the way through you so be careful when it comes out the other end thanks for setting this up for us allura - wait i thought i was doing the spell we could do it together you're awesome oh man it just feels like old days allura yes it was holy shit - yeah we know where she is (gasping) it's the island i can tree stride us there i saw a tree--did i see a tree big enough - we need to rest and get there - oh my god yeah - we need to rest and go i--i--i cannot get us there - okay all right (humming) is there a way do you know where we can maybe like restore ourselves faster (laughing) what is the minimum amount of time we could sleep i mean once again unless we do this-- unless we get to the island try and scout out-- find raishan island that way if she moves we won't let her leave what grog what we can camp like we did old school style no he used it to change jarrett's mind right well you did it okay well look if we wanted to go now i still have my beast shaping back i have one first-level spell two third-level spells and one fourth-level spell - i haven't used any of my health can we like do like six hours and chug some coffee that's raishan in her female form i don't think we're gonna lose the chance to kill raishan it's just a matter of who's killing who first allura since you know of the island and we know where she is is there any way where we can keep an eye on the island magically from afar if raishan moves we know she could sense it - yeah let's not do that she has none of her legendary resistances right now how long did it take when um we injuredwas that vorugal who retreated and started healing - umbrasyl - in his lair doing nothing but sleeping right i i think in recent events i can wait - how much do you how much do you heal up overnight generally okay we'd better get sleeping i guess well what do you want scanlan - you have been devil's advocate this whole time-- i don't wanna die again but she could kill us what do you want scanlan i don't wanna die either and i don't wanna watch any of you die again okay - do you like it shorter i just feel like there's so many people i could easily disappoint i don't want to ♪ i love you you know everyone comes from these backgrounds of having all these well-ventured and traveled pasts you were the first people that i knew and met so not only are you the longest i don't really have any other friends you are my family ♪ i'll try not to let you down i'm not a princess remember what is it with you and the theater (laughing) why as long as you go back to zephra with me maybe does my hair look okay does the short thing kinda work does it work with my bone structure the antlers aren't overpowering it right the length kind of balanced out this you know bangs no bangs i pass out from sheer exhaustion and we all set our alarms for exactly eight hours that was a good game - yay kerr-bear
