in which we have a new poster also designed by joma aka @forgingmeanings on twitter so yeah it's our next iteration of our box art poster the advanced edition y'all i know it's so great are vex and i still separated and is oralan still there is that his name so we're alone really glad you learned how to speak with animals who our what who as a druid would i know about guardian animal spirits that's not my strong suit man oh that's better okay 23 so because people just manifested the god as a bear it slowly turned into a bear spirit guardians okay nothing now i don't think it was made out of stars and space stuff percy did you find anything in the cave would i know if after the spirit guardian has passed would he just go back in his cave and bears are fairly territorial i don't know it might be wise to stay out of the cave look grog i touched a flower and the whole realm almost collapsed okay i don't know last time i touched something i didn't hear the end of it and now we're just going to let this happen you do you man you do you guys keyleth talks to the rest who stayed out okay percy do you have an hourglass thing we should play that gambling game okay i bet-- how much gold do i have three gold that's true that we have to run in after and save them you're going to take that bet okay that they come out safe and sound 200 seconds all right so did the bear only have one claw this is the lucky one 27 i think that means you owe me three gold percy well a lot of these spirit guardians tend to have worshipers and a lot of times they'll bring them gifts so that makes sense yeah i probably should have told you guys that before you went in sorry yeah it sounds like we've all been through hell okay i thought we camped on the outskirts right so we camped and we got up right yeah i feel like we camped out right before we went into the moonbrush but if you can't guide us through the moonbrush-- but you said you've never been here yeah i'm just wondering what his use will be from here on out hang on a second garmelie huddle real quick why don't we send him home he could die he's not going to be any use from here on out he's never been here which i'm starting to get a very strong feeling of we got betrayed by clarota at the 11th hour so-- station wagon facing backwards can i do a nature check to see if i feel a breeze at all or is he bullshitting 16 because it makes him seem smart as we go i just want to druidcraft little green pebbles no let's do brighter-- red pebbles to start leaving behind hansel and gretel style little pebbles tiny pebbles that i can recognize every hundred feet or so the theater how big is the river we have to get across the river regardless i can control water and part the river for a second for a hot second yeah i was trying to stop myself i cast control water and make us a little bubble as we walk i don't want to moses this i want to give us a little bubble that we stealthily walk under the river with the little bubble yeah the bard is just now figuring this out i sit down with percy i sit down with percy and i say six gold that after 200 seconds they run out screaming again ah there it is you might have won this bet this time percy i'm holding onto my six gold second to grog come on vex sure you owe me six gold but she's running back out screaming three and three we split the gold three-three it was a draw wait hang on how about this you guys i believe as an elemental i'm immune to charm effects that's true you're right i druidcraft the cotton oh shit flogging molly's playing the feywild yo i don't think that's happened since we played at home that's right if you want to rage and go in i can be there on standby i use alter self to shape my fist into a giant rock fist and i deck grog to throw him into a rage grog go get our bard keep the rage going nice which weapons you want the magical enchanted instruments we're good oh that's the happy campsite i thought he was being metaphorical i didn't know it was literal yeah we're not stepping on mandrakes right the shademirk bog no that was oralan ukurat's the lycan leader the fendir is that what you said this mystic-- iotha you said-- she has the power to subjugate your kind does she have the power to create more lycans the shademirk bog we're just stacking contracts if we take out the pixies what is the future of your tribe just a question do you guys hunt the pixies because i'm getting the sense that this is a weird turf war and i just want to know the full story before we enter into this contract why don't you guys just agree you guys take this half of the forest and they'll take the other i can even help you guys build a big wall if you want not to get oddly political maybe death is not the answer here they think i'm funny i'm not trying to take sides here just from a third party looking in trying to understand both perspectives maybe exactly not a bad idea i have a few spells that are good against people who can transform but we're also in the feywild so i don't know until we get out of here we're talking about exterminating the group of fairies-- you don't think they're going to put up a massive fight if we go in and start kicking their relics you genuinely think we can destroy the relics without harming anyone i want to see the pixies too maybe we can talk to the pixies about-- maybe they can work with us garmelie go percy we brought you here garmelie is there anything in particular about pixies we desperately need to be aware of let's go this is so cute oh all of us sure 17 to kick over their rocks they said it was the source of their power right that was very fun but it would take out the lot of them right how wide is the entire-- it'd be no problem for me i'm sure they have other means of spying on us here's what i have at my disposal a i can shapeshift into a little tiny spider and go in there-- no unfortunately beasts particular yeah once again probably destroying their entire village but yeah but i could go in like a spider and be a spider i also happened to bring hallucinatory terrain today so depending on how smart we think the lycans are maybe i can make it look like we destroyed it 24 hours let me double check before i make promises maybe scanlan do you have something that could-- i don't want to waste a spell and then find out that they have some sort of magical barrier enchantment that it can't stay up there yeah well i'm burning a spell slot yes 24 hours for a 150-foot cube i make a terrain look sound and smell like some sort of other terrain the only thing i have that can get us out fast is plane shift which will get us out of the feywild but i brought that just in case yeah we could do the hallucinatory terrain and if it fails then i guess we won't be in any worse situation well it won't hurt them it just makes it look different well we can do hallucinatory terrain and if we run into the lycans all we have to do is say we did it i was dropping little green rocks yeah they were red they were red rocks no i can do this at a range of 300 feet so let's back up 300 feet hallucinatory terrain are we doing this are we ready are we doing this i did it bamf i want it to look like the fairy terrain but their little huts are on fire like they've been raided and i want the circle of rocks to be obliterated and all their statues to be knocked over and it smells like fire and shit and pixie blood like grog said yeah i'm sure it smells delightful herbal they can see it but they can also be like oh this isn't real and werewolves 22 i'm looking out for werewolves for lycans athletics 24 you're taking us through the bog still to the bog oh fuck fucking old magic they're so scary to be fair i don't remember entering a formal contract you told us to go take a look at the pixies first and to get a second opinion and we have made it to the edge of the bog safely without your need of safe passage yeah they should've told us that i don't think they wanted to tell us that oh my god what's a good burrowing creature a badger yeah we entered i can dig and see if we can go under just in case can i take a look around and do a perception check to see if anyone else might be watching us that's not bad 25 are there rustles in the bushes from someone who might be invisible how long have we been up so it hasn't been a full day let's call it an early night can i i want to go minxie and do a little perimeter walk in the forest a little bit natural one elven sylvan primordial what was that last bit sorry i start purring i wait for a second and then start stalking them yeah can i hear the little discussion anything yeah i have stealth as minxie i get benefits right as a tiger oh yeah i do oh not good ten i just start eating grass i roll over and show my belly sorry 52 they're going to finger of death me aren't they they're going to do something bad i look distracted with other stuff i sniff and wander off just doing cat-like things i mark my territory i spray a little bit i'll just start a new one don't worry about it fuck why that one's a 19 can i go with the 19 oh that's a 16 that's good saving throw so 21 i've got my ring of protection which gives me a plus two okay i head back to camp whenever i'm back oh jesus oh man i'm a big girl come on so i stalked a couple of fairies for several hours yes i caught him up a little bit as we were walking back pretty sure it is the fairies who are creating the magical barrier and i'm pretty sure it's because we might've scared the living shit out of them so it might've all been still our fault all along like most things are so we'll talk to the fairies tomorrow they are actively looking for us they saw me as a cat i think they tried to cast several spells on me and by some luck of the draw i managed to feline my way out of them i think they are looking for me and us and i won't be a tiger anymore can i help hide i'll help her a little bit okay okay i will sleep then i guess i pick a space near vax i shuffle uncomfortably in my sleep i don't know why i just had a nightmare that just happened he wants to talk about your ibs and there are lycans i'll allow it are we awake i say good morning to them in sylvan they didn't bite any of us or get any of us we're not infected and they instructed us to kill you we didn't want to harm you so we thought if we just made it look to those silly dumb lycans like we hurt you by throwing paper balls if you will i did just a simple visual spell and we tried to move on as to not get involved this is not our fight you see can i understand what they're saying they were trying to exploit our abilities we were being held against our will we were threatened with life or death there was nothing personal it's okay i can fix it i have greater restoration she left right that wasn't in front of her i didn't say that to her oh they're taking him oh i cast earthbind on grog yeah it should ground him no i cast it to my friend who is about 12 foot tall and a giant target come on don't make stories up where there aren't any what you fairies are manifesting these ideas okay you are creating a dichotomy that does not exist oh see look they're doing it right now see that is what it looks like when an incantation is targeted at you it's one action it's one fucking action i just looked it up for that reason that's not good that's not a good initiative at all i notoriously roll terrible on my initiative are they going to form a-- that's exactly what i was thinking yeah they were trying to take grog fucking assholes i feel like we were very reasonable considering how unreasonable we normally are and a hard grog was that my fault this time it was a mild combination i might have contributed you first bud coming for you first what we don't want to do is spread out too much and get fucked oh snapricot i'm a fucking hipster okay i can do that this is my bailiwick yo i have an inspiration die ooh i don't think i'll need it though 28 you even lift bro come at me bro got the john cena going on is it because war caster and it's typed it's typed up it's not written in already come on come at me bro okay 27 wise as fuck can i dash and go a little bit further and still do an action and lose a bonus action no it's either like run or nothing okay here's what i'm going to do i'm going to try and start making my way towards grog i'm going to do the 30 feet towards him do i see the fairy leader i'm going to blow my 6th-level spell i'm going to cast sunbeam and sunbeam her in the face oh does it go through to the one on the other side behind her i was looking at the red one closer to me i don't have the fucking pointer no not that fucking red-- this one yes that one jesus and the one behind it no fucking bitch i said bitch i was trying to be nice to you fairies no it's not goddamn it that was a 6th-level spell that's right she does you guys are supposed to have good parades out of how many i'll help him first but yeah i can do that that's vex what why that one i do still have my inspiration natural 20 my voice just cracked but it's a natural 20 it is no i have a recording and an audition tomorrow no i did guys when i revealed it it was a 20 that's okay i'm going to do inspiration though just for safe measure that's good so 20 total now that's still exciting and i just give her a-- (grunts) from the corner did you go too are you petrified too did he get turned to stone i don't have any inspiration left natural 20 this is a real one this time a real one we know we're still terrified i'm going to continue my two steps towards grog since he was my first destination and do greater restoration and unpetrify him fucking 5th if they make this it's bad news they had to make 15 not my spell save dc or anything fucking fantastic now that i've burnt through two of my top-level ones wait i wanted to do a bonus action i did want to do something on a bonus action can i alter self my throat and (howls) give a wolf howl yes i'm calling for the lycans ooh that's good 23 have you been lifting bigby you know those hulk gloves oh shit you're a force to be reckoned with they were all above seven high five aw come on scanlan i take my last 5th-level spell to dump a greater restoration into grog to bring him back from petrification i can burn my 7th-level spell to bring back vax i will burn my 7th-level spell to greater restoration vax and bring him back you make a great parade balloon by the way you look great to be fair i tried those fairies are shifty little shits i am burnt out on all my higher-level spells oh my god you're still here we tried i didn't want this to happen i'm a bit tapped on my higher-level energy but can i maybe take a minute to ritual cast greater restoration on the two new statues of the lycanthropes greater restoration i can't take my time with it they'll figure it out i'm pretty tapped out if we sleep i can come prepared with lots of control water spells it wouldn't be that bad if i didn't get counterspelled twice fucking fairies yeah at the break you were talking about how badly you wanted to kill things you did you tried it was a good moment for grog yeah we let the disease spread you want to be a werewolf so bad you're just saying that because you want to be one so bad saturday
