we have the best fans it's so good yeah it seems like you've been so busy you do retweet cute emergency quite a lot like unfashionably late right before we sleep scanlan awkwardly put it in a weird druid circle rock thing it's over there he doesn't know how to do druid circles really right (whispering) i don't think he's telling the truth enigmatic what does he mean wait cutting webs he's vulnerable to-- oh to-- got it i got what they got along with delilah that's fun hashtag blessed i recently was able to attune to this armor that i haven't been able to attune to for a long time and now i'm resistant to spells so that's good yes kind of well i had to attune to my ring and my antlers and then i got the staff so i let that go but now i just wore it for long enough i have four because i took a feat when i leveled up yeah that's pretty dope and i think it's smart if pike and i dedicate a decent amount of our spell power to freedom of movement right before we go in pike is super strong she's a monstah okay so save that one for when he's real fucked up percy and i had a thought for grog if you borrow percy's spider-climbing boots i can maybe make some pillars to add for cover for some of us more rangey people but then if i add pillars of different heights you can climb up them i mean i could shapechange into something and give him a mount he can ride me i can cast in beast shape shapechange is a spell so if i'm a dragon beholder that's what you get your dice tray dried nicely though well i can do six of them i can do a lot of pillars i can cause up to six pillars each pillar is a cylinder five feet wide and up to 30 feet high and can do six of them well he wasn't that much more than 30 feet last time if i get grog 30 feet up you still have your throwing axe he's still reachable another 30 feet for you right theoretically but it's something if he's out of range do we remember how high the tower orby situation was did we get a number for it no i mean there was the dome above that i mean there's that gemstone thing that he's using that's right and then we could bring in the forces help us help us j'mon help us yeah i know i remember polymorph i don't know-- then what the fuck does permanent mean so they have to at least cast it at 9th-level in order to dispel it wait are you talking about polymorph or true polymorph right now because polymorph only lasts for like an hour what else you have nom nom nom nom nom food are you doing anything with your thing before we go to sleep hang on i will say a second scanlan will immediately clue in vecna that there's some trickery magic going on is there a way that second scanlan can be like definitely hidden so he can just be (snaps) support scanlan counterspell scanlan because he can also maybe just cast support stuff for us right and the only other thing would be like a second pike to do all of the freedom of movement stuff and things like that-- those counterspells man-- can second scanlan be invisible second scanlan okay hang on if someone has to roll to see if second scanlan is dispelled do you have to roll second scanlan has to roll vecna has to roll i can throw up pillars yeah i think the pillars could be good for cover and other things because i'm assuming we're-- so can we decide that earlier matt and that's cool i thought that's what we were doing we tried wait we definitely mentioned that this is real fucked up there's been a few times that we've all known we could die together but this might actually be it yeah it's fine yeah same aw that's so cute he's honest when he's asleep i think it's like his focus you know like it's weird to say goodnight right yeah all right good night all right to thar amphala on the back of a titan on the material plane good luck oh natural 19 28 yeah what were you trying to do i turn to percy and i go who's fighting who 17 uncomfortable elevator at a convention why did you wear wings oh holy shit oh it's been like-- two years (giggles) i know i don't want to have to do anything arkhan you look like you've you know-- you look like us you got more stuff we've acquired more stuff over the years that's cool yeah forever before we really knew any of you it was a crappy swamp it was good times yeah it was a crappy desert good times it was yes the driest of swamps yeah sylas quick question we didn't roll our temporary hit points for our heroes' feast can we do that or does pike do that for us for all of us right it's an additional 2d10 i'm pretty sure oh i totally should've given a speech no it's a short rest thing but it's a thing that lasts until-- yeah i should've done that before but i'll do it next time two ones and poison slim feast yeah those crystals that we started to break when we were in the shadowfell yeah in fact that's actually a brilliant plan we could disable a crystal maybe i could light a signal distract people while they're distracted we make it to the next one yeah in the shadowfell remember we jabbed at one and decided against it everything let's move 32 yeah yeah yeah you need to print one in black and white (laughing) that's such an la joke yeah all right let's do it you are fallible i don't know do we keep going do we try to get down some more opal die don't fuck me 18 move move move can you do the cool john wayne thing and go underneath of him and hang on his belly from the saddle 27 maybe wait for them to land sam and so wait is it vorugal is it thordak it's your old mount bony dragon wait did you put a cool little acrylic thing on there to make them mountable that's pretty dope i'll be downstairs is keyleth up top keyleth's up top okay don't fuck me gil right no do you always do this or is this new for you yeah you hear it six oh hello is there gaff tape in the house i know there's a row of it back there yeah get that roll of gaffer tape (mispronouncing) brian foster what are we making dex saves this doesn't give us spell resist right that's all right that's good 17 49 minus 49 i'm at 94 don't look down never mind i mean if it used to be yours-- i don't know sylas is up and moving no but it cancels out that sucks between the scanlans wait delilah or sylas okay hey scanlan two are you just as charismatic as scanlan one okay i don't care okay keyleth is going to try to do a one-two punch here she's going to move forward and then does she see delilah okay i'm going to reach out and do an entangle spell right under her unless she can make a strength save versus my spell shit fail so she is restrained and then i'm going to run and i'm going to use my mantle of the tempest to jump and then trying to be dope here in mid-air i'm going to change into an earth elemental and try and grab onto the bone dragon and see if i can snap his neck in the process grapple the bone dragon's head yes and then i'm running and jumping and grabbing for the rest of my movement a straight athletics yeah (whimpers) 11 yeah fuck her shit up prone and grappled and not for a very long time does he get entangled because he did just land in difficult terrain he's in difficult terrain i have rocky ground that's all i have 21 plus 14 yeah and you're raging right plus your rage damage don't forget to double that and is that doubled too okay come on come on grog the difference yeah i was wondering about that kill her kill her get it girl get it girl that's fine hell yeah kill him goddamn it john no vampire bullshit i have a reaction can keyleth the ellie try to grab it can i yes come on yes snatch that bat i'm nervous yeah this is like what dr seuss warns us about as kids oh my goodness matthew mercer (laughter) just the eyes cut out don't fuck me gil it's fine it kind of fucked me 12 jocks were not this polite in the locker room i love your commitment to the tickle if you guys let me go right now i can try-- you can do something no let me go first you can if other people hold and you describe-- how far away is he i'm going to drop my form take my action to cast earthbind on him it's a 300-foot range spell he did strength versus my spell save 22 you can't do anything can i do it again immediately can i try again yeah i know can i wait and-- he rolled so fucking high if you all hold i can try again yeah but it's a 300-foot range spell and he's only 150 feet away i don't think he can dash 150 feet but it's a 300-foot range spell right that's what i'm saying we get back around everybody is he still fucking here get him down you guys aren't going to want to hear this i can run forward and sunburst him at 150 feet away but it's going to burn my 8th-level spell i have sunbeam which is a 6th-level spell at 60-foot away no i dropped my form can i scoop up vex and dash 60 feet ahead and sunbeam him for another 60 feet i'm green yeah whose turn is it and her holy symbol that fell to the ground is what inert what a dick we're giving away things yeah actually max or ryan is there stipulations on the shirt we'll figure it out last time pike and i took it down with a couple of earthquake spells i mean we didn't have to go up the damn thing so maybe check yourself before you say things are you going to do that $20 bill trick in new york city thing wait stealth 29 aldor no aldor no we need a full 30 minutes to do a quick short rest i'm at 94 hit points i'm down about 50 or so hit points i'm 50 points down and i burned both of my shape change who else is down far no look super short i don't know what do you want i don't know but we also we broke down the barrier so vasselheim can defend itself a little more i'm 50 points down and without my beast shape i used it to go earth elemental because i thought the briarwood fight might be a little bit more beefy than it was but i don't necessarily need it to quote the leaders of vasselheim they have defended themselves through many forms of battle i'm not great i'm at 94 hit points so i'm down-- you guys don't want us losing any of our spellcasters right now i'm at 94 it's not a lot it's not bad but it's bad enough i'm a third of my hit points down yeah but every time you heal me and heal me and heal me it's taking away from something else mechanically i'm resigning my decision right now 16 points i'll take that 110 i'm still 31 hit points down for me i could do my speech if i had a short rest 141 i'm full is this the verge because if this is the verge-- like an hour a while pike and i burn all of our 4th level spell splots to do-- splots do all of our spell splots to cast freedom of movement on anybody with the exception of percy who already has it three each except we didn't account for-- or arkhan oh my god he has it automatically no i mean i don't know-- unless we want to try and get higher up before we go do we think this is it are we sure this is it okay so this means anything we encounter if it's not fucking vecna then we're barreling through it and going straight up because we've burned everything i don't know what's worth it do we have any idea of how much higher this tower goes do we want to try and jog another ten minutes before doing this okay okay before we burn everything-- okay we're going to go ten more minutes up and i'm going to give a speech as we go i say okay guys as we climb this tower i know there's a lot of stairs but the stairs are going to be fucking nothing compared to vecna but holy fuck these are a lot of fucking stairs the stairs are a metaphor each stair that we get across is going to be like another step further into defeating vecna you know with each stair-- i'm winded the stairs are long but they are not infinite be good and now we're almost there guys we're almost there this is it this is it (sobbing and panting) this is it you guys just keep going up the stairs and that's my speech 19 hit points and they're temporary not-- do we heal above that right so those 19 go first yeah and pike and i cast whenever seems appropriate it gives you an additional 19 hit points temporary hit points so add plus 19 on top when you lose them they're gone huh oh i had to roll oh everyone but for them dex save 13 can you dimension door not for any particular reason we're holding on our freedom of movement right we decided that until we get higher oh no okay i'm waiting for pike freedom of movement to scanlan one myself vax that's all i've got from keyleth that's actually a good idea it's possible but (uncertain noise) is what his face was right then keyleth turns to vax whatever happens lest it be trite stay with us casts guidance for the next minute which gives you 1d4 on ability checks yeah before we move just for the start of it can we stealth around them and not fight them at all that's what i was looking for can keyleth take a peek and see what's up yeah do you still have that dope that's real good 39 (inarticulate yelling) okay does it look like the floor opens it's worked stone he doesn't know anything that can help us we're in the tower of entropis we're on the back of a titan try to get them as far away from here as possible vasselheim is an hour away no we're in thar amphala it's been teleported to the back of a titan which is a giant mountain which is what we're on it's from the shadowfell you just have to get away and you're going to go away j'mon sa ord is here the slayer's take has probably been vastly compromised just get out of here get to the woods scanlan's right then go go i hate to say this but arkhan do you have him let's go
