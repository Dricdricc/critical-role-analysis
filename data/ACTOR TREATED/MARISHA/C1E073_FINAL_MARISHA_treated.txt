her we can do it she won't be expecting it we can find her but she's sick and she-- we can do it right now when she's not armed it's not about killing a dragon it's about killing her i just want this to be over okay okay okay i understand i feel like it's very telling when grog has more patience than i (sighs) okay i just don't want to wait so long that she gets the upper hand on us the longer we wait the more she learns about us the more we're letting her in the more we're revealing i feel like the longer we wait the closer is her inevitable betrayal okay let's catch up with the others yeah but what is this about (sighs) (laughs) look it's 2016 now you know why yeah i set off to find kashaw with vex (knocks) kash i hope you're not naked i don't know wow no i know no i mean i don't-- just don't worry about it (laughter) you're going to throw a rock at him we can't just poke him that seems so weird though why don't we just tap on his shoulder oh that's what i want to do that we did that sure i'll stand on the outside and look unsuspecting oh kash oh hi fancy meeting you here shit i keep doing that hi yeah i hope we didn't-- i hope you weren't sleeping mm-hmm yeah wouldn't that be

treasury we should go victory shopping yeah i mean it's basically our money though right yeah okay you know vex i feel like you might be a bad or good influence on me i'm not sure but i like it okay yeah they are like 50% of-- stellar rp so much dick talk is this how they talk themselves up second floor asum that'll do all right before we walk in i grab grog how do you do it you're able to utilize your rage when necessary how do you keep it suppressed when it's not needed please enlighten me professor grog promise deal ow ow grog grog no it's fine i appreciate it it's good oh man people are going to ask questions about that later sure yeah okay i don't want to let you guys down thanks grog okay (clears throat) let's do this is there anyone sitting next to raishan i sit next to raishan yeah i move closer to raishan i give a nod back i pull out the spire of conflux and hand it to her we retrieved this in our spoils you may recognize it as one of the vestiges that we spoke of earlier yes i thought i was handing it to allura (laughter) yes sure exactly we don't want to deal with two ancient dragons allura do you still feel a connection with the soul stone that's inside of thordak you built it you must know of some way to disable it yeah what the soul stone has been broken and abused before i have a feeling there's someone who might have an idea on how to disable it well raishan was the one who busted out thordak in the first place out of the fire plane so i would assume that raishan has some idea on how to-- well i have a lot of feelings about raishan everyone who we ask everyone who we send in there we're sending in to their death i keep thinking back to emon where we watched half of our friends die in a second it's true (sneezes) sorry yeah sorry so you don't think he actually even fully separated from the plane he brought the plane with him maybe then we're looking at this the wrong way maybe we go at this through the fire plane maybe there's something still there yeah we've got an easy door in and we don't even know where to look i mean we could at least talk to the ashari there they might-- it's huge but not many people know the whereabouts there's still locations and destinations within the fire plane it's navigable yeah they're very busy though let's fucking do this shit let's do it let's do it (yelling) yeah amazing i'm into it i'm really into it it was so short-lived i have so many guns in my belt no one can even see them and i'm still committed or an insatiably powerful enemy why don't you inform the room on how you utilized an entire race of people to break the ritual you bitch and you kept the soul and the stone inside of him no you used me you used us and my fear that i had originally appears to be true a lot of this is my fault i'm willing to accept my onus the fact that you can't shows all the kind of person that you are my promise still stands i'm thinking it might come sooner rather than later i understand that without your aid none of this would have fucking happened in the first place so it seems all of us can accept our part in this matter except for you what would you do if you actually got what you want i pull out the spire of conflux there are always many solutions to many problems you think thordak is the only solution to yours this staff was birthed from the head of melora the same goddess who gave you that curse what if you wanted me instead me and this staff maybe i can help you more than thordak can i'm saying i might be your best chance at salvation i'm pretty sure this staff is the closest living relic that we have in existence to the god who granted your curse thordak is no god that was your first stupid mistake it's up to you raishan clearly you are the type of person who looks for answers in other people you are clearly unaware of accepting any fault or any result of your actions why don't you start fresh do you really want thordak to have another sway over you another gift another favor that he's given you that he is going to hold over you for all of eternity do you really want that you're stronger than that are we oh no raishan we don't need your help let me say that right now this all depends on what you want out of the end of the deal spoiler alert we're saying no to that she's taken way too much she doesn't get to leave i say we take a recess gather our thoughts raishan my offer still stands if you want to come and find me i know you know how maybe we can commune with melora together can you guide his fury in a way that would be beneficial to the plan you were saying ideally if we could get him away and raishan rats us out would certainly put you in the good graces of the cinder king and you never come back he'd be forced to be the one to have to leave the battlefield you're a clever girl i'm sure you can make a ruse to make you look convincingly dead and we can all assume that when we exit this room that our tenuous alliance is still that correct yeah that's kind of true can i do an insight check does she know if asum is up to something no good 25 i think better double check that 25 and we didn't know until 48 hours ago tops we were forced i have ideas just actually kill her oh did they have like a clean-up crew down there yes she's definitely not as strong as the others but far more clever it's what she wants we can't break the stone they mentioned moving the stone that shouldn't have been able to have been moved correct they moved it inside of thordak and then thordak left with the stone in him right right so how did they do it because i'm also looking at another thing that is supposedly immovable laura marisha and kind of yeah that's what i was-- there's got to be a way to move it it could be the only thing that could break the stone what did you just say what say it again one more time how big is it how big is it roughly perimeter damn this place is really big and it's encased in stone yeah kind of right were we encased in whitestone right tell me oh yeah they die and they go right back to their plane are you trying to make me feel better about any of this the dawn martyr dawn martyr i mean only if we-- also we might be able to find some information on the stone we could go in with the rest of the fire ashari that are there we can meet up with cerkonos is this whole ziggurat encased in whitestone what okay i actually do have conjure woodland beings no woodland beings can be like fey creatures mm-hmm okay third level sorry fourth level what makes sense i'll summon a-- a little-- (stutters) a little pixie a lillul lillul pixie what sure and i send her in yeah i have them can't they cast like confusion or something like that or can they cast-- hey try and polymorph me nothing oh i know sylvan i know sylvan hey how do you feel queasy yeah hmm hey will you do me a favor and don't hold it against me will you go touch that black orb yeah yeah you got this hmm so as we expected yeah i don't think she's coming back yeah like a spell oh man have you been in contact have you attempted to scry or do a locate object spell on anything that you've thrown in probably it's really frustrating i feel like we have all the pieces here i just can't figure it out i'm really obsessed on this ziggurat thing have you thrown any whitestone into the ziggurat which is why it's frustrating because i feel like we can beat her to the fucking punch you already know how i feel we basically don't have a plan we're going somewhere until we come up with a plan in the meantime jesus let's put all of our eggs in one basket you don't feel like we are stepping into every trap that raishan has laid kill raishan first it doesn't matter we just need her to believe that i can cure her disease i could try that's what i was trying to bait her into we are sending everyone we know into one centralized location do we really feel like that's a good idea is it we didn't talk about throwing everyone we loved into the frying pan that was not the trap i'm down for the cause of the war just not when it's a stupid fucking plan we don't have a plan we're just asking everyone to meet in one location and then doing what with them and then doing what they're just going to be sitting there they're going to be sitting ducks i've accepted that people are going to die i've accepted that i do not condone sending people to their slaughter when we don't have a goddamn plan i don't think that it's smart to put every potential ally we know in one spot can we not divide it up can we not find places nearby but we also know that raishan knows everything that we're going to do i don't trust that she doesn't know anything i'm going to assume that she knows everything bring it she's on edge all right look at what we did with ripley we walked into every trap she set for us blindly we got cocky we got bold we fell for all of that we could all be dead i honestly don't know let's go check out fort daxio travis and i can scry i can scry there regardless and find a tree yes this non-plan bidet (laughter) we're finishing it now sorry guys those youtube videos of social experiments just send out matt i was going to say sorry for being a pain in the ass it takes a lot for me to sacrifice all my people when a fourth of us have already been sacrificed new at sundance yeah go knock on strangers' doors and get candy from them totally inflated
