eight 25 30 points of damage thanks sam matt as you guys are getting your weapons ready you have both your daggers out at the side you have your axe at the batter-up position you watch as suddenly they burst into red flame and a number of their charred burning bodies tumble to the ground motionless as the fire subsides all six have been destroyed by the blast from the fireball no no no he's on a wyvern so i'm going to say maybe come on pike come on that was funny 15 he hated us he hated us what's his name hey wonder why we hated him we can't remember his name seeker xanthas well if he's

feet long ten foot wide ten foot tall everything must make a dexterity save that's exactly what i'm doing yep and they are knocked prone and if they are flamey then all unprotected flames are

great roll ten points of lightning damage to the wyvern well technically doesn't call lightning every creature within five feet of that point must make a dexterity saving throw so he also takes the ten points of damage and then i'm going to use my bonus action to go-- let's go air elemental (sniffs) pit check is good (laughter) can i levitate a little get in the air a little bit yeah thanks bruh you're my charge yeah boy the adrenaline kicks in oh question are we inside the fort walls we're inside the outer walls so the ones that were trying to go through that door were trying to get through the inner walls okay so we've gotten through one layer of wall and we're trying to get through the other layer everyone seems to be just clarifying continue it's made of polyester it's real bad oh god gets a nosebleed what'd you get fucking dick can we take him out he was always an asshole come on he was always annoyed by us but vex he never had any redeeming qualities this is the first time we're

attacks what looks worse the wyvern then i'm going to take out the wyvern okay okay what am i adding hang on sorry i'm the worst oh plus five okay so the first one is 18 and the second one is not as good that's a 14 really aw so they each take okay cool so the first one is good 13 plus five so 18 for the first hit and four plus three is seven plus five is 12 12 for the second and then i'm going to use a bonus action i have never done this before i'm going to use a bonus action as a circle of the moon druid to use one spell slot to heal 1d8 hit points ooh seven that's good awesome i'm going to keep him locked down sorry sorry sorry jesus there's also a wyvern on my ass you got that wyvern on my ass thanks man he's not that cool would he get a strike of opportunity on her wait wait is it the big bird he might have reach it might not be out of his range big money no whammies that was the cutest thing there's still the guy on the ground right under my face get it girl that was on the critical right he was always an asshole always he always had a crush on you (laughter) quick bathroom break it does grant you cock lightning that's true it's like a 5th-level spell can i scavenge from the ember-roc take it they've all seen us pick our noses hey mom i cleaned the dishes yes i am nature check gil don't fuck me gil gil god damn it gil (laughter) like napalm percy do you have any vials left not a gallon but i just want a couple and i hand a couple to vex and vax just a couple vials of the-- yep nitroglycerin you can either make a really great molotov cocktail or maybe some flaming arrows but what about allura are you okay what happened we thought you were dead for a second oh fuck oh fuck what's your name what's your name she's been feebleminded i turn to kima was it feeblemind yes it's a restoration spell i try and calm her as best as i can to help pike any assistance i can provide allura i'm sorry we should have been those allies here by your side and we weren't and i'm sorry yes it seems it already has i believe he's still on the wall you were always mean to us why what did he want we have the hat of disguise can you give her the hat of disguise you think he won't care wipeout what does thordak ultimately want okay we knew that well he speaks to his crystals well some dickhead ratted us out vox machina i'm assuming considering you left our-- yeah we have well the clasp is clearly working for him now well he said the tunnels the clasp reigns dominion so-- well i mean it makes sense to a certain point when you have a big enough ego you don't have any more fears i guess here i give the stone to vex i talk to allura i guess is she there i would feel terrible leaving everyone again after we gathered everyone who cast that spell on you feeblemind that's very high level magic it was xanthas ah be long gone what happened to using this as our base was it only the wyverns and the lizardmen that attacked who was in contact with xanthras xanthras xanthas xanthas who was in contact with xanthas zenith who was in contact with xena the warrior princess then how did he know oh to daxio that's not okay well if they have to go through the battleground-- we're sitting ducks here out of 200 that were here where the fuck is raishan where is raishan allura you were talking about going to whitestone and what were all of your goals again all of allura's goals okay hang on hang on what time of day is it all right we can gather our most elite i can get a decent amount of people through if we teleport via plants very quickly but not all of them here's the thing 55 people walking near emon is not very covert and it's clear that there are scouts everywhere fort daxio was off the map until we showed up no one was watching it until we showed up but we are what thordak is watching we put everyone at risk no matter where we are to where syngorn's army is what's left of the fort what's undestroyed maybe we should have someone on watch are we sleeping in the fort i'm gonna crash as soon as i find something fluffy to fall on sure yeah okay you know what i can get us there and allura can get us back on the same day what are we getting at whitestone is raishan there and she was getting asum you know what yeah let's go all right they're totally great man they can just crash on our couch for a few months the problem is that we've summoned many of our allies to fort daxio and they are currently in transit to that current location correct yes it does i imagine whatever he's building what is he building do you know insight check what was that that's okay 23 what right right okay so wait tharizdun is that another god did she say that i mean there's some-- i feel like there's not some sort of voltron thing considering there are more vestiges in the world wait weren't they-- i've got the scrying eye cashew's kinda mad at us but allura can teleport us back and forth can he scanlan what do you think ah sure (laughter) allura hang on wait i'm talking to her i'm not voting i'm talking to her (laughter) allura i have had destiny pushed upon me since birth what do you feel is right because i'm not sure what to believe anymore make this decision for us but in many ways you've been our leader-- (laughter) wait are you trying to use this as an allegory oh clarota yeah is he strong enough is he all right allura fucking god dammit you guys i'm not making votes here in many ways i feel-- (laughing) jesus christ in many ways i feel we are walking down the path you've already walked in that case i feel it's time for new blood and we've been with gilmore since the beginning we need you as an ally back here we'll keep you on the sidelines as an oracle and we'll take gilmore to be by our side look he set me up to make the call okay i was trying to follow through jesus i demand a recount in pennsylvania and florida specifically are we assuming that we're sleeping after this because god damn that's right because we bamfed to whitestone never mind
