yeah let me see if i can beat you to that and you can get $3 off your subscription with code 'criticalrole' also the dear vox machina article series has been going on on friday nights wait whose came out last i think mine's coming out tomorrow i think keyleth is tomorrow you should probably turn yours in you should probably do your work jeez fucking slackers galavanting in hawaii and then your first episode of signal boost went live on tuesday don't burn yourself good i'm glad i'm glad you're not totally embarrassed it's very fun the internet loves you it's uncanny bees are great bees or die oh they're very nice they're sweet that's it no one else added anything else it's so good every time zone once an hour on the hour what time is it and not to be confused with maccready yeah you got the cornerstone mccree maccready and then what is the name of your character in evolve which is also a cyber space cowboy it's so good you guys you could adjust the boom ermagerd querstions offscreen i guess outside of 'cows and consequences' the bard went full-on theon greyjoy style can mine be from mansions of madness can mine be from board games i'm partial to the time where i was playing as ashcan pete who's my favorite character to play as in any cthulhu universe i was down to one hit point had lost my weapon and was hiding in a chest and i popped out of a chest and punched a shoggoth and killed him the old hobo jack-in-the-box technique and it was great and i'll never forget it ashcan who can ashcan i want to see is there a barovia travel poster out there someone has to have made something like that right yeah come visit sunny barovia yeah keyleth has a hard time killing the scum of the earth so no i have a good one this is from @carakiriyama on twitter if the characters hadn't found each other and formed vox machina what do you think they'd be doing instead keyleth might be dead keyleth would try and continue on her aramente by herself if she had to maybe find other people to pal around with along the way she tagged along with you guys because she was afraid that she'd die out there alone which once again probably would've you started salivating almost (laughter) @lchow on twitter says who comes up with and assigns the episode titles i think this is a funny story mainly they come out organically like at dawn we plan we all walk out and go like well that's the title we do most everything ourselves i would cry so much it's not like we have a plan i think people assume we have plans it's such an urban outfitter inspirational poster our stories are never over (laughter) one of these days me and you our ideals are going to come to a crashing head oh yeah yeahmarisha  don't taliesin taliesin we all felt like such assholes about that we were all like wow that was dumb that would've been a good idea hey similar kinds of things happened with the dragon though where it was like this is going well this is going pretty well-- oh shit once again internet i think-- everyone's like well pretty much everything that could've went wrong did that pretty much-- we did pretty well considering but we have him on the run someone asked a question when are you getting shirts on geek and sundry that says 'your 'fun is wrong' i think 'you can certainly try' is next someone asked if keyleth was a vegetarian again no she's not she's a druid she just acts like it (laughter) well it's online grandma it's online no no it's not like on tv i feel like some of them are apparent right our biggest fault i guess her tragic flaw extreme self-loathing and guilt fairly transparent on that one there i think yeah keyleth pretty much hates everything she does and feels worthless yeah we're all degenerates we're all fuck-ups here's a question that i actually get a lot this was from @tiamat_zx on twitter why was keyleth hostile towards kima in the past in the very beginning yeah you can't trust her shifty eyes no a lot of it's starting to slowly be revealed now actually i feel like but keyleth doesn't trust really any type of religious establishment it's not necessarily where she comes from and i think she's had a few bad experiences enough in the past to where she's seen the corruption of a church and at the time kima was full-heartedly running into a blaze of glory and death and we were sent there to go grab her with really no other lead on who she actually was or what she actually wanted i didn't trust that right and i think we happened to have two personality types like keyleth and kima had two personality types that butted heads that's mainly most of it i'm the awkward unlikeable one i get it about fighting the dragon they're going to be so angry at us those dragons i feel like it'd be like transferring high schools and you're the new kid in class walking in for the first time and you're like hey i've had that legitimate fear because when we came into this we were already two years into our characters and i was like jeez it took us a while to find them and make them as deep and complex as they are i feel like he's feeding us hints who are you the chat room yeah we're mature adults i think okay i will say that liam and i walked away we were like wait no one flinched at a scanlan and pike scene no one flinched hey stings they're not here i'll answer for laura wink wink wink you will never be those protesters outside of comic-con someone said i think it's supposed to be @alkie on twitter how did mary elizabeth and other guests come about are you friends with them and they just wanted to join are they friends and wanted to join i love that in classic windows fashion the tablet decided to update and restart in the middle of all this so we don't have access to the chat anymore @nerdyequestrian on twitter is there something growing between vex and percy there's a lot of who-are-you-guys-jonesing-for questions about the two of you i desperately want to know what's in the letter windows decided to update it's not your fault a lot of people think i'm leading vax on that's good i want to go off the map there's so much to do grog no holds barred like zero fucks kill shit it's great he's like the polar opposite of keyleth it would be such a nice palate cleanser it would be so nice to be able to be reckless and not care break people's necks whenever i want to must be nice being grog and look at how much we all hate ourselves oh we've got to find sokka a master got to find you your own sword he's also very deep i don't think any of us have looked at him as a one-dimensional character also someone was asking if he was based off of a real person and we were friends first which is how they always say you should do it (laughter) someone was asking for you to explain where the college of the maestro came from @chaoticnachos on twitter asks what shirt are you wearing liam this is the x-files shirt this is when x-files came back how did i miss that is that like a thing that's been happening because i missed that @cmdrdara on twitter says how do i get my fellow party members to not be murderhobos and what happens if your fellow party members are murderhobos and you're not that is true yeah well i was going to say i think keyleth has her blind guidance that i don't think she's aware-- like her positive effect that she has on vox machina that i don't think she's even aware of that i think she-- because keyleth is under the assumption that she's constantly ignored and that people are like not-- no right no i know i know that but she's-- i don't think she realizes the influences that-- i don't think she actually realizes the power of her influence that she actually can wield for the better no pike gets close pike has gotten close a few times with grog with her-- you're like one look man one look grog because ashley made a keyleth killing a child joke now i got the questions were there ramifications for keyleth killing the child yeah hey sorry you killed a child oh god oh god well i pretty much did the same thing too when i accidentally killed the half-dead dwarf as minxie by picking him up by the neck when we were in the underdark yeah i picked him up by the scruff and he had one hit point left it was just enough that was where the i try so hard and i'm the worst came from yeah keyleth's the worst she's-- go to sleep go to sleep it'll be over soon (laughter) no it was great it was dominate plants during pathfinder days you know i like-- believing in the what i like to call the community zodiac as in dan harmon's community and keyleth is definitely the britta of the community zodiac she's britta make it a good one keyleth is totally britta see community fanart crossover community fanart someone said what's worse doors or dragons that's a pretty good question yeah this is about the time where i'm like do i need glasses yeah someone asked if umbrasyl was suicidally depressed yet regretted a decision in character or while dming go so many i know all the time yeah oh no fuck you kilgrave well i get angry at keyleth sometimes for not being more assertive and then there's some times that i want to say things as marisha for keyleth but i'm like no she wouldn't she would be bowled over right now and she would go with it so there's several times where i'm like (inhale) fuck why couldn't you speak up and then there's some times where the game moves faster than we can keep up with it and sometimes you're like i want this to happen god there have been three separate times where i've wanted to come knock on your door and it (snaps) the game rolls past it yeah theater etiquette i remember and the audience noticed it and they were like if they don't come back to this moment-- i came over and i sat down and i said-- we were in a tavern and i said keyleth puts her head on vax she leans her head on vax and then gilmore walked in no it was literally like a fucking bar scenario i was like oh there's gilmore got to go (laughter) yeah can't sync up cannot so much ross and rachel oh my god so ross and rachel oh and to greg who says keyleth probably regrets not reading her spells and i'm going to join ashley and speak for you even though you're not asking for it we have a lot of fucking spells man you're so stressed well and people don't understand either along with dm rule-bending we don't necessarily know how you're going to interpret the spell there's a ton of things like mist form that i didn't know how it was going to act in the moment and it didn't mean i didn't read it i read all of my spells hundreds of times i have hundreds i have hundreds and i've read all of them and i will try them in the moment and sometimes they'll work in my favor and sometimes they won't i don't always know is it really wait did you say matrix i haven't heard that in a while are these mine yeah-- oh my god you guys where am i this is ridiculous already so soon 18 18 (groans) natural one second luck down already damn 29 (groans) every damn time (laughter) all right so bonus action is different than a free action right okay as my action i am going to cast sunbeam and i guess since percy's the one in my line of sight i am going to be beaming it right at percy 19 fucking balls matt and (counting) 38 halved that is true as a bonus action i'm going to cast grasping vine-- sorry percy that is true never mind then i'm going to go earth elemental and i am going to sink into the ground okay i come up really fast this is happening fast in that case-- i'm happy where i am i'll stay there what do i have to roll i took 35 damage-- yeah i am good 15 that hits okay piercing is halved for me 11 17 seven ugh three as an earth elemental plus five so eight 14 yeah she makes it but i'm partially covered hits is that halved is that magic or no so 30 hiding is poorly explained in the player's handbook honestly yeah it's great what about me no it's my turn again already wow okay that changes everything fucking fuck i still have sunbeam sorry that changed my whole plan sorry pike whenever i blast i'm going to flip around here fling sunbeam blast pike constitution so i lost sunbeam but i rolled higher than half so i always have to beat a ten that sucks you're sure it's not the other way okay that changes things again okay this is a lava pool right here fuck it i'm going to come here because i do double damage to rock things i'm going to smash this open i want to smash that wall 16 plus whatever i do against-- what do i roll it's just a regular attack it's just a regular attack then i'm adding plus five so 22 no 21 hang on it's plus eight to hit so it was actually more 2d8 plus five i double the dice so i roll two more oh i double the whole thing ten plus five 30 damage with that i am going to back up move and tuck here behind this wall with my earthglide as well oh fuck tensions are so high you guys i'm still an earth elemental shit this keeps happening i have not cast sunbeam since you told me i-- you can face it away i'm going to do something similar and i'm going to move and i'm going to go bam and slam into that one come over here reach you know okay that's good it's a plus eight 14 shit 18 damage okay i'm going to do my second attack then bam that's much better that's a 16 plus eight all right also much better damage so that's 13 plus five 18 so that is 36 okay and then i move back and i hide again just walking 30 if i'm earthgliding 60 well then i'll stay there i guess oh no 4d10 holy balls oh shit whoa you made good ground as he says it out loud 29 what about over here can i turn and see if i can spot vax oh cool awesome okay i want to see if i can sense vax with my tremor sense can i do that yeah i wasn't sure if it would actually work here it says i have tremor sense but i use my own perception because it's mind-based this is so nerve-wracking i can feel my blood pressure going through the roof 60 feet i'm going to beat vax's face in even with the tremor sense (deep voice) i love you (laughter) second attack even worse it's a two oh that's fun to know that's fun doesn't matter no three terrible i rolled fucking terribly i'm going to go (deep voice) hug hug we kind of paired off you guys i've literally successfully split the battlefield in half at least i've accomplished something i am pike from your nightmares hex faded on me correct so i don't have disadvantage anymore on my strength rolls every little bit helps but don't i get advantage because it's an attack of opportunity first one was a 16 second one was a six which isn't great so that's 14 okay what are you looking for what about me and my tremor sense that's so good to know that that's how that works (singing) secrets secrets secrets don't make friends can i hear where vax is okay what do i do now as an earth elemental i want to bust down this little wall right here well i'm going to do right here i don't want to tear down the whole wall i just want to tear down a section of it all right let's try it 14 (singing) tiny dancer in my hand (punching) (laughter) that's a one for the first one so negative the second one's a 19 that is 22 points total i want to back up just kind of tuck a bit you rolled a fuckton and twos and threes being the person who died first last time i know it sucks at least it wasn't a finger of death like five minutes in okay i want to very carefully step forward here ooh yeah 15 can i sense vax again or anybody else for that matter yeah you're my friends i want to drop my earth elemental form kind of guess well guessing i want to do a flaming sphere doing it 4th-level why not wait i need to-- i'm trying to keep track of two different sets here from my real game and from this fake game sorry sorry sorry correct 60-foot range 4d6 i want to go (explosion) in this corner how big is it oh it's only a five-foot diameter i'm guessing there sure i'll ram it into vax now that i can see him uh-huh and i'm going to tuck behind this wall and see if i can hide i'll tuck behind the wall at least all the fire fucking fuck i have no idea where vax is do i right if i peek around this wall can i see pike yeah so no one's visible whatsoever i still have my sphere up i don't know where anyone is fucking fuck i don't know what i would do aside from something defensive at this point i didn't take faerie fire today let me go ahead-- i do have sleet storm that i learned i think it's just an instant let me see really quick 20-foot-tall cylinder 40-foot radius 20-foot tall 150-foot range last i saw vax was over here i'm going to do here here i kind of want to get pike well then sure let's do-- what's this (counting) let's do here-ish (counting) yeah it's right here anything in that area has to make a dexterity saving throw or make a spell save dc or lose your concentration as well can i tuck back against the wall is it versus my spell dc i still have the sleet storm up right 30 right ooh natural 19 i just keep it up pike still hasn't really moved right she's still in her same position okay i want to peer around this corner and see if i can spot vax would i theoretically see that happening through this wall crack yeah it's my turn first i want to peer through the wall and see if i see vax at all so since i don't see vax-- has there been a 20 okay it's a decision on if i want to-- i'm afraid if i do a fire storm and if i mock out to pike if that would be considered metagaming if i knew where she is do i have an idea of where she is i don't want to be a dick i don't want to break the game let me-- i'll just leave up my sleet storm i guess i'm going to do a wall of stone spell and i want to block off here and can i do another column to block off here i want to leave a nice gap here if i can can i do that is he in the room with me i'm going to be really upset if he's in the room with me oh and i tuck back against the wall yes i've always wanted to do this spell yes do it it's not our style so we can't do it in the real game is that a natural one doesn't he also have some sort of poison from insect plague or something like that rough that's a pretty shitty roll though would that affect pike too on her move sleet storm oh the guardian is not concentration that's dope holy fuck that's dope you've rolled so much and you haven't done anything it totally is i should have fucking packed faerie fire that was stupid it lights up everything i took cure wounds and thunderwave and healing word instead for my 1st-level spells it's a really good 1st-level spell he disappears over here through this wall into bugs into bugs into bugs bugs bugs totally with you there okay hang on a second hang on hang on sorry i'm double-checking something before i do something stupid okay i'm going to pop around the corner and i'm going to do fire storm all up where i think there's bitches so since i saw vax go this way and a bunch of action and a bunch of insects over here i'm going to start it here i'll probably try and get this corner too cube matt and yeah (counting) dex just pike that's 7d10 (laughter) ooh 24 34 43 plus another five 48 points of fire damage apparently 13 critrolestats is the only one we trust hiding again and i'm still maintaining my ice storm just sucking up in that pocket against the wall 48 we're so frustrating against ourselves seemed like a good idea at the time never give her the ring are you talking about my spell slot ring of holding my level five spell slot ring holding well it would mean you would have a 4th-level and you could have a level one i took your cloak so i technically have your cloak from-- if we're going from the last game it's normally my ring there were two rings we got a 5th-level that kept and then there was a lower level-- there was a 3rd-level that i might have given you no it's just we actually get to see chat where the fuck are you because you're not in my fucking fire storm he wasn't in my-- son of a dick i'm not your friend buddy i'm not your friend pal well it takes a while for them to catch up i'm not pristine i've taken sneak-attack damage which hurt badly keyleth is up okay keyleth is going to peek around the corner i can see pike right i can't see pike through this oh solid wall i can't see anybody great great i thought i was going to be able to see her was sleet storm dropped so he still has to make dex checks right so does she and so concentrations i should remember it and i did okay i can't see anybody through my window then right i died really quickly last time i didn't want to-- but that's the thing it's the guessing game i don't have a lot of aoes at this point actually you know what i brought tidal wave where was the last action that i saw i saw shit go down over here okay so the last thing that i realistically saw was insects and-- okay let me peek around the corner can i do a quick perception check to see if i can spot any movement or-- if i can't see anybody i can't do anything i don't have line of sight and i literally burned my aoe spell that i brought for the day such a dick i'm going to cast cure wounds a level two cure wounds on myself because i can't see shit that's true that's true i never do that because i'm a melee person well let me just cure myself since i already said i was going to do it so i'm going to roll a 2nd-level cure wounds which is-- and then i'm going to tuck back behind my wall because that's where i'm happy in my box level two but concentration spell burn burn burn it totally is if waldo was a serial killer that would be phenomenal like a freddy krueger where's waldo again already okay i'm going to peek around my corner do i see anybody another perception check i'm going to peek through my wall of my hole that i've made it's an action 27 to see where the fuck you are i'm looking through this wall then i prepare a blight spell and i hold until i see either pike or vax appear in my view nobody move come out come out wherever you are are you just fucking hiding motherfucker are you just waiting this out are you camping right now are you being a fucking camper i'm going to do another scan to see if i can find the motherfucker my same hole and then probably nothing 18 okay someone's got to do something here let me see what do i have in my bag papa's got a brand new bag i am going to-- i still have a blight spell prepared right so i put it away i'm going to crawl out of the wall here crawl over this is still lava flow correct all right here's what i want to do then-- i didn't realize it would stretch that far okay i'm going to-- sorry there's a lot going on i'm trying to figure it out i don't have a whole lot i'm going to cast a tidal wave i'm going to leave my sleet spell up i guess i will cast a tidal wave which is in this thing ten feet wide ten feet tall 30-foot long anywhere in a 20-foot radius so i can see here correct i want to do it going this way here where i can see and going this way yeah it's instantaneous so my thing is still up fail 4d8 so that's eight 16 17 wait 4d8 17 that's my turn and i'm going to tuck back up against my wall sleet storm is still up sleet storm sleet storm 28 is such a great roll too (whispering) show your face you dickhead you dick okay i'm going to pop around the corner again do i see pike at all i just broke the fucking pen i just did a travis i'm going to do another-- it sucks when you can't see people it really fucking sucks i am going to call lightning i guess (quietly) no not really okay okay i'll drop it i am going to bring it down here do we see vax now simon oh hey bud hey friend what's up oh no what's the matter you lost you lost simon oh don't worry bud we're going to get out of this okay whoa fuck okay so the walls are coming in do i see a floating weapon no i don't see the floating sarenrae weapon or anything okay i am going to-- okay i dropped my sleet storm i am now going to come through and come here do i see vax at all i'm going to do another perception check negative a two i've been rolling terribly so we're trying now the lava's caving in-- i'm going to just hold blight i'm going to hold my action and see if i see pike or vax blight or call lightning well i'm holding my attack action it depends on how close they are well i have call lightning up as a concentration spell and blight is an instant action if i see pike i will call lightning if i see vax i will blight i have my wall of stone up here and here sure right hey baby okay low rolls ten 13-- 28 damage (high-pitched) sorry this is like a nightmare i had (laughter) okay vax is down how sadistic do i want to be in typical keyleth fashion i walk up to vax and i say so sorry i'm so sorry and i push him into the lava (laughter) wait wait wait i'll never let go i'll never let go vax that was gnarly i still have a move and a bonus yeah i know i move over there and still have a bonus right all right i am going to healing word myself yeah i'm just going to do first-level here just to top me off four that sounds horrible i don't even know what that is 14d6 all of them roll them all at once yes just go out to the parking lot take our shirts off (rage sound) stop pulling my hair 31 points right or 95 minus 44 i way overcompensated 51 not 31 okay so first i want to do just as my action a call lightning right onto pike the first natural 20 of the night 22 halved 11 now i want to use my bonus action to cast blight or sorry no to cast grasping vine i fucking love lava by the way if i can do it here that's true it's not a grapple it's like a pool party wrestling match slide now slide now slide now dip baby dip i'll take athletics for that 14 oh hot oh hot hot hot i'm alive i'm alive a 7th-level spell you have a bonus action 7th-level spell what the fuck (sarcastically) oh my strongest points plus three nine 16 oh shut up i'm in the lava just screaming bloody murder had you rolled a few points higher on that lava she would have been dead or had i rolled higher on my lightning oh i totally did say that didn't i if it makes you feel better i kind of forgot about it between now and then (laughter) so wait i have a question my armor has spell resistance which gives me advantage on saving throws but that wouldn't have helped against her thing just now but i didn't have to roll to save oh my god it was a charisma saving throw i would have had advantage it's already happened i rolled an 18 plus three so 21 yeah because i have the ring of protection i gain a plus two bonus to ac and saving throws what my armor does yeah so i would have saved against that fucking fuck a 21 i would have saved at some point yeah i'm sure man that's funny had i saved my next move was going to be a thunder blast to try and push you into the lava it came very close she would have had to come back back up with one hit point and then would have done it again cleric victory clerics are badass in general you guys did a lot of damage to my stone form up front but someone almost brought me down i was at six hit points and i stayed at six hit points for a long time yeah you were about to drop me i ended up dropping it myself because at this point it was turning into a mexican standoff and i couldn't do anything and i can't cast spells when i'm in an earth elemental form i was just running out of options i was down to the wire because i burned 7th-level on firestorm 6th-level on sunbeam which only did half damage on him once so that wasn't great i still had a 5th-level spell left and one 4th-level i burned through all my 3rd-levels and it'll be an eight-hour fight sam would be tough to square off against he'd be another one to get me down to the wire it's tough too because a lot of it comes down to order after a while it comes down to turn order it all balances out if i hear one more read your spells people i am going to murder somebody no more no more read your spells or read your sheets there's a lot to keep track of this is my binder look at all this yeah it's not like i have three full-time jobs
