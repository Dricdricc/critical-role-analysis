on our app hang on it's refreshing you should've given us warning did you just-- panlanann i am panlanann the wood half-elf blood hunter dude my abilities are balls though i have a five dex and a four wisdom that's sad wait you got dope stats look how fucking crap these are you should try sleeping on the floor it's actually really good support sure oh my god you killed your whole family oh okay never mind keep going i'm sorry where's home where is this place that you stole-- that's what he's been doing this whole time isn't that what you're doing to yourself on a daily basis have you tried any other bloodlines i'll save that for another day how'd you sleep aside from the crappy bed yeah i mean it's not a bad gig i guess we should greet the town yeah maybe we could just stand in the middle of town and go bryce until they show up okay i have a question about this broad barn thing is broad barn the name of an establishment or is broad barn a very broad barn it's a very big barn what if it's a tavern i don't know i got confused in his delivery all right yeah what does the town look like when we step out front how bad is it was i in the butcher's because that would be some real horror-level shit that's kind of awesome question answered i'm sorry i'm standing by fjord question answered while they were having that conversation i'm hanging back with fjord if you're cool with that question if you were a crazy ravenous dog humanoid person thing what would make you really hungry all of a sudden i didn't phrase that question very well yeah it seems like they're into meat kind of anything also they're really hungry more so now i don't know why more so now but what if they are still hungry you know who else was really hungry out of fucking nowhere big angry toad man devil toad guy i feel like i should get better names for all these things i don't know i mean it might be a coincidence well considering some of them were undead there was that whole zombie gnoll thing yeah how could you forget that i legitimately didn't understand what you said are you okay i was just striking conversation okay let's go to the barn broad i was going along with you i turn to jester and i go look inviting look heroic bryce some of these gnolls were undead or raised from the dead do you have any inkling as to why or have you seen that problem around here before (gasps) bryce travis and sorry a lot on my mind speaking of the aurochs i asked you yesterday if you'd heard if any of the farmers had had their cattle hit you heard that yet it's fine we'll ask on our way out it's good i know i feel like i learned something an insecticide generally refers to insects and we're talking gnolls you're going to have to use a lot is it a good pickle though guys let's go kill gnolls nom nom nom yeah so good no you take it for her please what did you say molly well the butcher got severely cleaned out if we can try and figure out a way to set up our operation on the edge of the forest so that we're not in the middle of a field in the open-- hills are bad to fight in unless you're on top of the hill that's good go ahead actually that's not a bad idea at all maybe we could have like a survivor round up team and a defense team we can always go back out and get more ears whenever we damn feel like it let's go travis and oh good i see you brought us your best reggie thanks man i saw them take off into the forest i tracked a little bit right between those trees i don't know we can start there i'll be on the lookout for cart tracks it's not my strongest but it's okay 16 no wait i rolled a natural 16 so 19 i thought it was a 13 i apologize wait are there nearby towns are there other nearby villages oh we only saw one okay can i get like an odd estimate of maybe how many gnolls we might be dealing with based on the amount of tracks i turn to the rest of the group and i go good news we're real stupid if we thought we couldn't track them because there's a fuckton of them that'll be easy bad news is oh god there's a fuckton of them that's it or is it just open fucking hills how rough and how open is our situation right now are we in the middle of an open field remember how i was like this is the worst situation to be in i feel like this might be the worst situation to be in survival perception oh no did you see that one god what if i gave jester a ride on my shoulders while we walked in the cart and i'm holding you it'd be kind of cool okay like a saving throw or just a check that's okay it's a 14 (strained) yeah you are oh god-- (grunts) jester i'm going to put you down yeah i help jester hide the cart seems a waste we're not in any tree line or anything let's flank around do we need to have some sort of awesome whistle or something to communicate with each other oh what was that thing you did in the circus that was cool (whistling) yeah i imagine that the ends are going to be where you need the most strength right great 16 do you think they're centurions if they see us i'll bet they're the alert system but we have to kill them all at once yeah you want to try and make a distraction and bring them closer to us then we can jump out of the grass do the old jump out of the grass-- oh buddy (slamming) i'm going to take the blunt end of the staff and go right for it as it skids by i'm going to take right in its neck ooh not great ten i didn't get my bonus attack on that guy can i get my bonus attack okay i want to try and bring my heel down on top of it as it tries to scooch away fucking-- did you see that nine nine you know i had a long day yesterday okay just was faster than i thought do you mean the hyenas oh mining i misunderstood that too i'll take the opposite side that he's doing a ghillie net that's what i was going to say is it heavy how big is this thing can we fold it up and stuff it in a bag oh that's big we can grab it on our way back and throw it on the cart canary in a gnoll mine (laughter) we have to do it it's too perfect sorry that was going to be my question and dies that's right yeah like a walkie talkie i'll punch you in the face what's going on it's so dark it fits in there oh are there any close to me okay i'll close the gap and come at it with a big double swing from my staff finally a decent roll 19 six plus four that's ten points of damage i shake it off my staff a little bit it's effective i'll look around are there any other entrances that was me me and caleb oh sorry for the bags yeah oh yes did you light it is it a lit lantern oh i can close it on and off right like one of those things all right guys left tunnel or right tunnel i kind of like her when she's like this it's good yeah little drafts anything like that this sucks 22 oh that was well done fuck i'm afraid if we keep waiting more will just show up well maybe we can draw a few over to us and take them out on our terms if we can make some sort of distraction to get their attention and if we can put or heavy hitters our people up front we can try and hold them in this mouth ranged people in the back you see more are going to keep coming normally miners build coal mines with connecting shafts and double exits in case one side collapses you always want another way out we just don't know where they've put everybody we're here looking for villagers remember hey matt dm question if we were to try and back out of here and draw them towards us what would that be just a tunnel yeah that's what i heard it's only a death funnel if we're the ones dying right if they're dying that's good for us surprise round get as many range and aoe spells off as we can yeah that's good let's all agree that if this goes bad we run oh god can i get more into a place with beau in this crux mirroring nott stealth check natural 20 three-point landing i (gagging) nope okay i'm going to do something weird and i hope it works and doesn't fuck the rest of us i'll move up right here next to fjord 40 that works good there let me go one more that's good then can i reach in my bag and grab out in my little pouch grab out a handful out of my 1000 ball bearings a lot of ball bearings can i take it and-- you know how you can take your pocket and flip it inside out and have a bunch of ball bearings go (metallic clinking) across this way is that my action okay i'm going to spend a ki point and as my bonus action take patient defense i'm shaking god that's bad i don't think i even fucking spelled it right i think i botched that all across the board i spelled it hyneas miss oh hit with disadvantage hit 17 is my armor class this is with a bow i'm going to cat-paw try to catch the missile with deflect missiles what do i spend-- oh wait oh no wait this is a ki point oh no it's a ki point to throw it back it's just a reaction it's 1d10 plus seven nine plus seven so 16 i hold it out like a microphone and go-- i laugh at it as it comes at me miss i haven't but we rolled at the same time yes i'm going to take my staff i'm going to try and crack this guy on the back of his head where he is jesus christ al-fucking-mighty 13 does that hit i'm my own worst enemy i'm going to do a knee and a round kick-- oh no sorry i can just do one i'm thinking in advance one kick with the knee i wipe my hand on fjord really quick whoa it was effective yeah nose punch no aw damn it right okay how far away is he i'm having a hard time seeing can i close the gap okay can i do some cool monk shit and do some wall running and leap and parkour and then get to this guy acrobatics parkour oh that's good that's a natural 18 plus six miss my foot just taps his arm just a little bit and i leap off of his arm as i'm leaping i want to take the staff and come down and go (crack) with a slap double handed piece of shit gnoll oh god it's a two that was my eight-sided die i'm trying to efficient my rolls i scream as i come down the whole way going (screaming) i just go (pop) and do a little jab okay that's an 18 that's just a d4 four so eight get a good hit lollipop sounds great fuck yeah that was awesome bad physics i turn behind me i go watch the ball bearings watch the marbles shit i want to do this as my two-handed attack but for flavor to skin it i want to stroll up channeling the rock charge up the elbow then we go a people's elbow come right down just a full body weight (thudding) with advantage can i consider it a two-handed attack oh my god why (yelling in pain) for flavor my second attack isn't really an attack i'm in so much pain i go (yell) and i kick a little bit natural 20 every time i try to show off it never works that's what i'm learning okay three doubled to six plus four so ten i don't care too much i just roll over and go fetal for a minute come on nott bring it home it's almost something like a jacob's ladder moment the end of his life is being stretched out can i since i'm in that general vicinity go 20 or so feet into this hole and listen and see if i hear anything 13 i bend down-- i turn around and come back to the rest of the group and say there's something bigger i think there's something bigger at play here whatever is driving these gnolls i think is deeper in can i look around and see if i can find anything like any papers anything from that humanoid that might be intelligible okay 20 total can i try and figure out what this is if i recognize this symbol in any way yeenogru yeenoghu yeenoghu or what matt and jewelry wedding bands anything while he does that can we no we can't take a short rest it's not enough time nope ignore what i said there's something real big back there it's real big she's got a badass scythe i saw nothing that would clue me in as to what might be deeper and really big okay let's go while we wait for those three minutes i turn to molly and i say do you remember anything in your recollections of this yeeahnoghu laura and uh-huh yoplait is a female deity or a male deity do you remember i'm wondering with that whole you know-- well the guy the guy running the ceremony said that the hunger will be fed ours and hers right i mean that's what he said right dm i didn't mishear that i just wonder who hers is who is that yeah what no oh my god we didn't know about this we knew this we totally fucking knew this he's so nice he's such a teddy bear
