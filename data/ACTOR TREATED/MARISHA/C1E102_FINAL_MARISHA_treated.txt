word that's what she said do they just assume your character doesn't go to the salon and cut your hair is that not a thing did we fight oh no that's right we went down going through i'm assuming it's going to take us some time just to even get there though right sure do we still have pass without a trace yeah let's at least move for 30 more minutes are me and you in robes you lead with the censer (chanting) with advantage 17 like parting for the queen at the ren faire or taliesin jaffe at any party i could tell by his cheers shirt (laughing) yeah i do a little gust cantrip and put a little of the censer smoke under the door i'm like an oscillating fan yes i do that's exactly what i was going to do is it anything like we've ever heard about do we still have 36 sure can i tell what the herbs are thank you is this something that i would get advantage on for my herb book 28 i did i write it down and i press a flower or i save some of it and then can i druidcraft some more now that i know what it is okay i'll go ahead and make as much as i can okay i take half put half back in the censer and give half to percy does anybody else want some actually should we dab ourselves with it no is that weird give some to percy anybody else want some how thick does it appear to be or through it 17 go to the gate okay i'll see if i can discern something here a little bit better you go go check it out i ask them how thick does the wall appear to be around that side i can try and stone shape through it oh weird oh no what if we dismantle the gems didn't we take some of that crystal didn't we take some of that didn't we take shards of it from the thresholds in syngorn one of them shattered and i feel like we took some i don't know maybe it's useful in this case where was the gem embedded in the doorway is it unworked stone what's the ground like i could attempt to tunnel us there percy i'm sure you would know more than anyone what's the likelihood that we might encounter that i might bust through a dungeon or something though over there i can get us under the wall for sure i can do both it's just figuring out what we want to do okay can i stone shape-- -- a crawlspace through the wall big enough for at least grog to marine belly through but i can't carve a shape through the wall to just crawl through five feet yeah through the wall not under the ground i want to bust a crawl space through the bottom of the wall it's not a dynamite blast it's like a (rumble) yeah it's like butter so cover for me what okay seemingly to no negative effect i've made a tunnel i'm whispering i'm just trying to be more pragmatic no we didn't keeping track why is he keeping track i'll wait and see everyone else through just in case i'm going to try and keep a lookout it's not coming up oh god am i trying to do anything but get through i don't know i've got to crawl through yeah thank you thank you i'm going to see it and immediately beast shape into a little mouse and (crawling sounds) through 18 yeah immediately poof i'm assuming no more than a kitten's worth cool cool cool cool story cool (wheezing) you could have told it gently five points (wheezing) i made it guys i'm glad you made it yeah call them off tell them it's handled we're dead where's the nearest 7-11 thanks scanlan mr mistoffelees (whispered) what's around us right now (regular volume) sorry what's around us right now do we really not want to do any other healing might still be useful i feel like we're going to have to do a lot of things to stop this what if it has to keep expanding all the way to the crystals i thought he blinked before are we at an hour and 15 minutes a wink man semantics why you're trying to bail aren't you were you trying to run is there a water bucket around 11 i take a little bit of the water and control it and let pike wash off a little bit or he was trying to bail before the final part of the ritual he had rations no one takes rations what if the giant orb has to reach the crystals yeah the (buzzing exploding) i'm a little rough nice we're taking a break we would 30 i join vex i look around are we still in the shadowfell that's not great 18 oh my god i mean maybe we should return to something like sabotaging the machine or burning the city oh god vex is rubbing off on me agreed how far did the blast go that you saw i believe me and pike both do yes between me you and pike we can take this tower down hang on 180 feet in diameter hang on pike and i check our spellbooks real quick for up to a minute and a hundred foot radius centered at a point but i mean two earthquake spells and grog i will point out this will be burning mine and pike's 8th-level spell but it might be worth it i can tunnel out underneath it how far are we from the tower in this little house you guys could do the feast and some of us can help tunnel out the ground during that hour so we're going to try to fly up i have a feeling we're going to be down here a while keyleth looks out the window again are people panicked are people running around is there a rabble in the street oh that's good 30 man you're frosty today you're just-- well how are we going to go in though just flying up and then what and then what though once we get there play it by ear i can't i gave vax foresight i cannot turn into a beholder today do you have shapechange i'm honestly still kind of into the earthquake idea bringing down the tower i'm not going to lie how do you know no no no the tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in your area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends and the spell lasts a minute ten of those ten 50s with pike and i it's concentration for up to a minute and it has a 500-foot range and a 100-foot radius so pike and i could split half and half of the tower i feel like if we go right up to the top of the tower it's like walking into the danger this is insane well how do you mean it's my concentration so i can keep it going and do an instant reaction spell i mean i can throw a fireball and keep it going yeah god i hope this works i don't know if this is going to work grog can you at the right moment just do a big-- see if you can topple it over i know matt's stone cold and if we can be hidden while we're doing this instead of being open we have a 500-foot range here we've got a dope-ass range how many robes did we swipe totally 'little rascals' it oh i love it that's a vestige right there be cool be cool you need to get your eyes checked then your depth perception may be off hoods forward just nod and smile i'm really bad at holding my eye shut for this long we only need to be so far out like the fourth of fucking july it's totally taken us to whitestone 19 pike and i huddle together and try and join forces let's do it people don't tell us to stop if they're not afraid of what we're doing i love you all we do it above the screaming howling horror nights sound effects it kind of worked it brought it down did anyone of significance die in the process i can plane shift us if things get really bad but i kind of think we're already on our plane to the top of the tower can i hop on a carpet or broom i'll hop on the broom with vex beholder has the anti-magic cone eye situation just wait and see how long does it last to cast that's fine yeah i follow your lead it's true but not today hey you guys bitchface briarwood i do have a page do you want my beholder page that's terrible for me too oh give me that back page sorry i also gave you advantage on everything i think you didn't use anything seven i had so much hope when we took down their tower it went away very quickly we all die ugh should have done that fucking feast 13 is it like shapechange oh it's true polymorph 27 they roll disadvantage against you too you rolled a 20 oh no none of us can do anything to help him fucking shit we can only be so hopeful and if it's active being held what's the deal with that oh bitch you better back off bitch come on not again oh my god that's not a spell you guys i don't know if pike can fix this yeah a natural 20 would break it that's the only thing i rolled like a 27 you have advantage on everything that's good that's okay oh my god you rolled a 19 was that the one you critted on did you count that one they're broken from it by being in his gaze am i in his gaze so i can still cast spells but if i move into his gaze i cannot if i shoot up at vecna will it go through the cone i will not go through the cone it is now my turn why he lost concentration is he 60 feet away from me is he within range should i handle delilah or should i handle him is he within 60 feet of me vecna (counting) he's exactly 60 feet in the air i have to get directly under his butthole can i get directly under his butthole jesus balls what about delilah where is she if i move at all i'm going to take opportunity from skeletons jesus okay i am going to head to delilah i can move up to her correct can i i can give her disadvantage on constitution checks and whenever she takes damage she's stunned or should i do the confusion thing i'm turning into ashley johnson okay i'm going to go up to delilah (pants) cotton mouth oh boy yeah okay i'm going to go up to her and be like experience what you've been putting all of us through and i'm going to touch her and i'm going to try and cast contagion on her with mind fire that's telekinesis kyle travis taliesin and i have a bonus to my spell attacks it's cocked that's even worse not great 18 her mind becomes feverish and she has disadvantage on intelligence checks and intelligence saving throws and she becomes confused for seven days hopefully i don't have a lot for a bonus i can go into an elemental form no it just lasts for seven days okay she has to make constitution saving throws but she's under the effects right now correct we've been through this before haven't we it says after failing three of these saving throws the disease effects last for the duration so that would make me assume that she has it at least for three rounds i almost did that but it's a 5th-level fucking spell that's a lot that's lame three rounds for a 5th-level spell oh he doesn't look happy i feel like i just pissed off the dm it does say that after succeeding on three of these the creature recovers from the disease so they were already affected that's a natural one 38 is he moving towards the altar no saving from it let's hope he doesn't roll a nine or a ten y'all you are fucking lying to me (groans) no that means he's disintegrated there's no recovering from that dude she doesn't have to roll against that he doesn't get advantage wait with the disintegrate go scanlan go can you inspire yourself but you're a war bard right war caster that was a 6th-level spell does she have any more of those because i only have two just straight melee my dice suck it's not good 13 fuck it why am i light-headed don't fuck me gil 22 why didn't we heroes' feast oh no he's going to turn to the cards y'all he's going to turn to those cards what ugh okay that's good 14 plus 13 so 27 so if i kill him he'll come back or if i kill him grog won't ever come back what does that mean is he always going to fucking fly no wait can i bonus action him can i use my bonus action kill her is that doubled are you shooting at vecna you're shooting at the death knight taliesi what are you trying to say are we going to bail what do we do but grog what about you scoop him into a little vial so we're all together percy oh god okay are we trying to get to me so i can get us all out but everyone's coming this way right everyone's coming this way then i'm going to-- fucking hell how does fire storm work i know it's ten ten-foot cubes does it have to be on the ground or can i hit him up there can i rain-- justice rains from above can i do that but i'm not going to be able to hit the death knight and vecna what if i got out of the way could i i'm going to do a bonus action and i'm going to go air elemental full-on wrath of my people and my hometown and i'm going to levitate in a cool tornado-y thing that's high but that's okay in between but don't worry about it i'm going to right onto vecna and try and swarm it down towards the death knight ten ten-foot cubes what do you mean hold on what does he have to roll under my dc yeah i'll try and levitate down a bit i guess so scanlan no mr mistoffelees come back he could be stuck there forever we have to be touching i can be wind now what was the name of that one city you guys syngorn is syngorn still in the feywild where did we go what city in the feywild did we go to i can bring you back we have to all be holding hands y'all yes feel free to hit me i don't care i can't be grappled oh he's flanked no grog we've got to get out hold hands we'll talk later dust and dust it's very handy are we all holding hands are we all in position oh my god we are getting out of here right i rolled a really fucking shitty initiative are we all here we're all sure about this we're out 100% we're on this plane right then we're going to the feywild and we all hold hands-- yes i drop form and i pull out my tuning fork and my flowers and i think deep about the gilded run and the shademirk bog and the beautiful pond that we appeared around that we know there's a portal right near it that's what i think about strongly and i say everyone think about the pretty ponds spring break 2017 feywild i'm sorry i would have taken us home but we were already there and i had to go somewhere else i thought that we were pretty badass when we took the tower down and we were not i can get you back man i can get you fucking back but true resurrection says i can i can't believe i fucking dumped my 9th-level spell in you and then you got tied down it made zero fucking difference we both wasted our fucking 9th-level spells
