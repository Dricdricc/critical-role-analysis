might be sooner rather than later now the pool water is salt water i kind of agree with that well this is all from what i can recognize deities that are not sanctioned by the empire i mean things that are wanted that are illegal are going to be wanted it seems like there was clearly a high demand for some people to worship who they want to maybe they were gathering a bunch of these items because they were looking for the exact one for this one any dope bos bo staff no i have a staff can i assist him on that you have assistance roll with advantage can i try and do it myself and do a ki point
