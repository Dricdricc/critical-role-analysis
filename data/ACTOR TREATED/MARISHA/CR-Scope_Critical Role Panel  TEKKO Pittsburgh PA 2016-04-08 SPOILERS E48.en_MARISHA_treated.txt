(nervously) hi miss you troy (laughter) it just shocked me hi it shocked me these are-- they're kind of barely useful just going to put that over there sure you should start now that he said the magical words critical role-- (applause) i am also a voice actor/person who does things in the entertainment industry out of los angeles i am margaret in the persona franchise i'm laura arseid in legend of heroes trails of cold steel-- longest name in history ever-- i'm in metal gear solid phantom pain and battlefront and he's my dungeon master (applause) i know i know and then i went on and i had many other dungeon masters and then i came back (laughter) oh i thought she was talking about the vape show (laughter) no vaping (cries out) it still makes you feel like you're in trouble i'm not-- i wasn't it's like when a cop gets behind you when you're driving and you're just like i'm just going to mess with my radio i'm just going to act natural i don't have any reason to be concerned ten and two ten and two (laughter) we have an insane cast of people like laura bailey and travis willingham and liam o'brien and taliesin and ashley and sam riegel that's true (applause) they are like look what you're missing guys and i'm like i'm in pittsburgh i've got primanti brothers take that see they know can i just say the most ridiculous conversations we ever had though in the geek & sundry offices were revolving around this sloth i was like guys we have to stop talking about him like he's a real person it all started with them going well when's the sloth going to come in and they were like well you know we got this call we got to see what his schedule is and see when he's available because we're going to have to book him out he's two weeks out and i was like what the-- i'm available next week i'm pretty sure the sloth works more than i do in the entertainment industry and then ivan was like the sloth is actually going to be playing a half-elven monk and i'm like what stop saying these sentences like it's going to happen it's weird you were my first dungeon master i grew up in kentucky it's not that my parents were trying to keep d&d away from me or anything like that my parents just also didn't have access to it and we didn't have access to it because it's kentucky and you know-- we're worshipping that cult shit so then i came out to-- but i grew up with magic the gathering and i played a lot of rpgs and i'm a big final fantasy nerd and so i was always a video game and comic book nerd beforehand i just didn't have the resources to play any tabletop games and then i came out to los angeles and i was like hey matt mercer will you run a d&d-- and i thought you'd say no and then he said yes that's true (laughter) and for all those aspiring dungeon masters it works yeah it wasn't like that (laughter) yeah in fact that's the total exact opposite actually how did that even happen how did d&d players get that reputation i mean tom hanks and mazes and monsters big bang theory laugh tracks-- mainly thanks to travis willingham (laughter) the guy who played football in college-- audience and vin diesel that's cool yeah surprise they're nerds anti-life-shell boof meet within ten feet of me whole room everyone within ten feet that's right applaud him now get up get out no no them i'd also like to point out an amazing woman up front cross-stitching the de rolo crest that caught my eye i know it's a work in progress is it okay if we see like what the what what the what this is insane oh my god oh my god you guys (applause) yeah it's so incredibly heartwarming to see the whole art-inspiring-art aspect and that's what i think is incredible about it like i said critical role would not be the show it-- we wouldn't be critical role if it wasn't for the critters and the fan art and the fanfiction and the music every little piece of art that you guys put out we try and catch every single one of them and it's all just incredible he knows almost all the artists he knows all of you people by name (laughter) yeah it's liam appreciation day there is an amazing woman who wrote us i think over our facebook page not that long ago saying how she was thanking us i'm a 39 year old mom you guys convinced me that it was okay for someone of my age to play she picked up a book and started playing a game that's what i think is the most important lesson that we can learn out of tabletop gaming in general that there's this really sad societal pressure that starts pushing on you really hard when you're suddenly a child then you're suddenly an adult and then when you're suddenly an adult it's like you're not allowed to play anymore and you're not allowed to use your imagination and i think that's a really sad travesty i think it's important to remember that adults can still play pretend and make believe and that that's really important to our mental health especially as stressful as life is as an adult yeah yeah i've been saying this a lot here lately where i've slowly started to realize especially with the show making our games weekly that keyleth has totally infiltrated me a little bit and she's made me a better person i legitimately believe that 100% i'm not like keyleth there are so many ways that she's different from me but being her for so long has taught me to empathize with people who are like her and she's influenced me and i think she's made me a more empathetic person i think there's a lot of important things that you can get from roleplaying games that people don't talk about that we should yeah it teaches you to think differently and to think how other people might think it breaks down the idea of the monomyth that there's a definitive line between good and evil which i've never believed even bad characters even the evil of characters generally have motives that are rooted pretty logically they're good lessons matt and we should take questions because we've just been rambling it also teaches fast response time doctors will take improv classes to help with their response time audience true story and the reason why they do that the reason why that rule is there is because as soon as someone denies you something it does two things one it makes the person who was setting up their point look like an asshole you immediately just rip the rug out from under them two it stops the scene so say for example if i was like hey matt isn't this ski slope totally awesome today now i look like a fuckin' asshole (laughter) what oh my god i didn't know you didn't tell me we were going to the ice volcano bro see how when you accept it and you're just like ice volcano totally it gives you permission to keep going and it builds on it i think that's very important and people ask me all the time what was your worst dm experience i was playing a buffy the vampire slayer tabletop rpg and i was a pyromancer and i was used to him being like how do you want to do this so i got a kill and in my head i heard matt going how do you want to do this but it was a different dm so i was like all right so what happens is my character concentrates and then a little fireball starts hovering over my head and then it arcs across the room and then it just (poofs) and it lights the vampire on fire and they die in a blazing flame of glory and the dm i swear to god goes yeah you know pyromancy doesn't really work that way and i was like well that's funny you mention that because pyromancy doesn't exist (laughter) it's already dead yeah does it matter how i kill it his response was the way pyromancy actually works it's more that you just like meditate really hard and then whatever you're meditating on just bursts into flame and i'm like hmm that's so cinematic so cool i'm just going to-- yeah it's just giving people permission to keep going that positive loop that positive feedback if i was just a vampire slayer and didn't have magical abilities then that would be one thing or percy's like where can i go to buy black powder (applause) or if who was it laura bailey is like where can we go to find a map i need a map maker (sad noises) next question your hand went up pretty fast yeah audience go for it audience what was your question (laughter) audience that's a great question real quick for those of you in the back who might not have heard the question he said how do you deal with couples in games because that tends to put an expiration date either on the game or the couple audience every episode it doesn't matter you could do something amazing and oh matt's getting on the couch tonight i'm like sure it's a nice couch he'll be fine there's a separation we're not insane enough yet to where we don't recognize the separation i'd be lying if i said we didn't absolutely get 100% emotional about our characters and about things that happen in the game but i think those two things aren't mutually exclusive you can get emotional and you can have feelings and realize it's still just a game and it's still just pretend it still doesn't mean that this game for us hasn't been incredibly important and even though it is just pretend it's not it's so much more at this point it's hard to quantify matt and in-game assault oh salt i was like what is happening at your games (laughter) going off on this as a player and talking to everyone else out there who are players be kind to your dm not only because he can kill you at any moment but-- respect your dm and respect the time that has been put into these games because that's-- not necessarily this is what you were saying but you will sometimes have one of those players that gets in and has that bull in a china shop type of mentality and just wants to take over a little bit there's nothing wrong-- and to dungeon masters there's nothing wrong with being like hey that's not cool because do understand players that your dm has put in probably at least an hour if not more for each hour you play of game time there's already probably been ten hours of prep before you even showed up to the game you're all there for fun and it's a blast and it's awesome but there is-- there's a line you guys know what i'm talking about where there's a line of being respectful and having fun and joining in as a group as opposed to mocking it and-- right or trying to hijack the whole game which is disrespectful not only to your dungeon master but to everyone else who's set aside time to be there you know d&d it's co-op you're working to build a story together and if you can do that and find a group with good chemistry that can do that that's when you'll be the most magical of moments yeah does that make sense we're not trying to be a fun police there's a difference here right makes sense okay your fun is wrong yeah i'm not trying to do that yeah next question okay you had your hand up yeah audience (laughs) yeah you in the plaid yeah you yeah (laughter) i'm going to build a world now there's still so many times where i'm like how did you know we were going to do that you had some inkling that we were going to do that and i don't know why you just-- someone just said something in passing and you're like they're going to do that my favorite was when we walked into the back door of the clasp of the thieves' guild and he wasn't prepared for it man that was a good game (laughter) you're walking in the back door all right you're basically like (knocks) hey yo what's up clasp yeah we kind of went in the back door and-- yeah (laughs) and matt rolls out one of the dry-erasable marker grids and starts just drawing the clasp this is where the clasp lives here we go good times i imagine it's kind of like when you start an rpg and there's the fog of war on the map and you kind of slowly flesh out the map as you explore and you just kind of lose the map fog i think he builds in the same way i can't say i'm not speaking for him purvan purvan (laughter) perve-on next question (screams) you pick one hey do we have a panel in after us all right let's keep going oh we have 18+ after us okay go go just for those who are running curse of strahd audience let's do in the back yeah you who's going like this yes you that's deep that's a big question you stopped and looked at me very expectantly (laughter) i am (laughter) yes see i'm so ready i'm on top of it i've slept today what was i going to say a lot of people ask us-- we are not voice actors and you guys do all these voices and i want to be a good dm like you but i'm not a voice actor and you don't have to have this insane mel blanc type of range to be a dm just even changing the placement of where the sound comes out in your mouth can be enough of an identifier so for example i naturally speak at the back of my throat which is why i've got this gravelly thing which my theater teachers hated but they love it in voice over but if you start moving it more to the front of your mouth and you start dropping little bit more breathy i didn't change my tonality at all and this is more where keyleth lives it's a little gentler it's a little softer and you don't have to necessarily change-- i don't have to go to the crazy voice to do anything crazy it's a little bit of placement and that can just make a world of difference you talk all the time about voicing women when you dm and you don't have to sound like an snl character oh i picked him so you pick oh you got like a cap thing going on is there a presentation i feel a presentation coming i was just there damn it what do you mean they're getting attacked by bandits yes audience even the episode not too long ago so it shouldn't be huge spoilers where grog fought earthbreaker groon and he called upon scanlan and vax and he was like where do you get your power from my friends everyone was like this is the anime episode it's so true it's so trope-y (applause) the power of friendship thank you strongbad next question yes oh 11 really apparently i'm signing at 11 i just go where they tell me to go look on your schedule next question yeah you doing ninjutsu yeah you yeah the rick and morty yeah audience good question who are you no keep going i'm taking notes mental notes one more quick question guys-- oh boy you look so eager back there yes audience first-time dm tips use the adrenaline rush the adrenaline is real let's do one more quick question that's a good closer let's do up front yeah my favorite part of playing dungeons & dragons just in general as a part of any game is the ability to have dreams later on in that world and be like oh shit my brain just thinks that all actually happened and i'm kind of okay with that (laughter) good final question thank you guys so much (applause) i have a stunt acting and stunt fighting for the camera panel tomorrow from 830-930 or 930-1030 something like that it's fun and you bring sweatpants and get active because i teach you how to punch don't punch each other though the morning one at nine got canceled because you guys aren't going to be up don't lie i'm not going to be either so it's the later one do the later one not the 9am one i won't be there
