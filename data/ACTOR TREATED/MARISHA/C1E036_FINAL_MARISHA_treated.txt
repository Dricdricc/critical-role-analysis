eventually vax strikes a mortal blow krieg or brimscythe defiantly smashes against the support pillars of the cavern in his death throes causing the chamber to collapse the party barely escaping via the teleportation circle leaving krieg's home allura finds the party and warns that the evil that feeds on the throne is growing more bold she herself was attacked shortly after the scrying was complete and barely escaped as dark clouds fill the sky above emon the party decides the time to strike has come allura aids the party in infiltrating the palace and they storm the throne room uriel sits upon his throne surrounded by his creepily mannered possessed family vox machina attacks managing to banish the shadows from within their bodies but the throne itself cracks in half as the dais below glows a deep red summoning the entity behind the entire scheme a devil prince called juurezel who tells the party of a great war between devils and demons spilling over into this plane threatening all creation he justifies his actions and notes all the demonic forces throughout the city and tells them of the horrible devastation that will ensue if the party stops him they read him as honest and juurezel asks for their aid in destroying the demonic threat offering a single wish should they make a pact the party deliberates and agrees to the contract thinking over what they had just agreed to the party returns to the throne room asking for their wish to be provided to aid them in their demon hunting upon its casting the party wishes to cancel their contract with the creature and attack the devil prince angrily reveals his true form a hideous treachery demon a glabrezu a long deadly and epic confrontation ensues one that suddenly claims the life of the gnomish cleric pike her death fresh in their minds vox machina deals the killing blow sending the demon to its unmaking they gather up the cold body of their fallen friend and rush her to a nearby temple of sarenrae where a resurrection ritual is attempted and succeeds into what i don't think it works that way i try it i believe i believe in the spirit of winter's crest i think scanlan actually might have a

through the field and saw a dead raven (laughs) more or less it caught my attention and it made me think about the past several weeks what we've been through and everything don't know-- who knows it probably died actually in the rebellion maybe my ice storm killed it or something thanks i was looking at it and it reminded me of everything and i feel like i was instantly trying to forget about everything because i don't want to remember but we should and i don't want to remember you the way you were because it was scary and i didn't like it i like you now so i took the dead bird and cleaned it and kept its skull and put it in this box for you as a reminder of what you could have become what any of us could have become really at any time because we shouldn't forget it's a little macabre and i would have bought things but we're out of money i'm glad that's not you regret no better than you could have been there's still a lot to come you know i think we all wish we were better than we
