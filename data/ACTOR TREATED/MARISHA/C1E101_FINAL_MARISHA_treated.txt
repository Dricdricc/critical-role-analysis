still in front of a green screen the art is looking so good great lakes avengers jeff lewis we announced it on tuesday on talks yeah jeff lewis still jeff that was so existential of you vex wow that was a really meaty spell she had i've never seen that before recycling and both seem to suck magic in correct it's too tight a room is there an underground water source near whitestone we could try and flood it with acid while they rummage keyleth wants to test the radius technically i can flip gravity i don't know i felt like i should put it on the table no that's not what i meant i just wanted to be honest well it hasn't been relevant yet we could theoretically forge more of these right or do you think they're blessed yeah are they magical tary are these magical outside of the field well that kind of clues us in on a lot actually i was trying to test the radius of this sphere too am i still doing that is that still relevant wow that's a long way it's the same as the other one okay yeah sure you guys have fun collapsing if it falls on you we can fish you out just survive a little bit badger badgers burrow right do badgers burrow but i rolled so shitty on that nature check before right we should make little pike backpacks just her but with like a jockey on a horse (straining) those gnomish thighs you could hold me in your hands i've got about 30 seconds just to fly up can i ride side-saddle with you okay your abs are nice vex have you been working out over the past year wow i lean over i druidcraft a pebble toss it in the hole yeah all right can i be like all right i want to see if i can do this like cool maneuver i'm going to try to balance on the broom and then jump off the broom and go keyteor and go into the-- nah it's like whac-a-mole all right i'm going to earth glide to the bottom and then peek my earthy face out of the top see if i can see down yeah i'll try to be conscious to make sure i don't hit anything that looks precarious all right looking for traps that's okay 15 just a drop-through can i like-- fuck i found like a it might be a roof or-- what piranhas i don't know if piranhas are in rocks but there might be something else in there there might be piranhas oh i'll avoid it there's a ladder man there's some very innovative people yeah these are very innovative cultists yeah hey pike and grog you guys did an excellent job ashley and okay good idea (unintelligible grumbling) i try and say like well i know it's about 180 feet because i tested before so i'm trying to be conscious of it and then i back up a little bit and i go over to where that tunnel was and i start collapsing it down as i work my way up i'm going (impacts) it's like a platformer half of my level or something like that or it's a third of my level still several hours (guttural noise of agreement) (laughter) (guttural gibberish) i speak a different language that i still don't think anyone has-- i don't know we've gone back and forth on it not that different from my normal speech this looks like it's rotten from the landscape it looks like it's all gone bad has it gone bad 25 does it have a name a what vafall it makes a really good salve it's good for sunburns yeah i can do that through the tree i pick a blossom from the tree on the way out where's allura can keyleth go talk to percy keyleth waits for percy hang on i can go talk with cassandra as well how did that go yeah you think i hate being sick anger at least drives you towards something fair point i have a crazy thought and i needed to run by you sorry didn't mean to hit you okay i'm excited all right we watched the orb change she changed the magic in the orb right we just spent a year making magical orbs that change in some way that are all linked to our city clearly not as powerful as what this is but what if-- i don't know what if she corrupted something that was already there that wasn't supposed to be corrupted what if she can corrupt more things like our crisis orbs i had this immediate fear that what if i built something that was supposed to help-- well you helped me build it am i crazy for thinking it am i totally off base maybe there's something in our own technology in our own magic that can help inform us i don't know all right we'll sleep on it and those symbols the necklaces druids we use similar things when we plane shift to other worlds i think i can plane shift us there with it if we don't want to go through the orb i think it seems like very similar technology magic yeah i don't know sleep on it i'm going to go think the crisis orb room actually i'll go with him oh that's good take it bitch sorry go on i'm looking i'll meet you in the library this is a tiny hercules mulligan i was looking for him he's been in here the whole time yeah and i call vex there as well a fuckton of old notes vex okay oh my gosh oh okay oh praise sarenrae there's so much going on okay remember how whitestone used to be all dead and awful very similar to how the other ziggurat was dead and then they called the ziggurat the seat of pelor right so what if it was already there what if she's taking doorways and dimensions and corrupting them and bastardizing them and-- what was he locking away the chain oblivion okay well that's a big deal and delilah came from wildmount you did a bunch of research on vecna he used to be a man right taliesin and i mean it sounds a lot like what delilah is going for what if she is vecna yeah dread pirate roberts of the vecna she came from wildmount where vecna originated she came here for research maybe she's just finishing what he started and wasn't she doing a bunch of research for runes and tomes do we have the research that the briarwoods-- didn't we seize a bunch of their research do any of those ley lines go through where we were in marquet i wonder if each ziggurat is over a nexus they were also trying to build that whole bridge situation remember the bridge that was weird they wanted to move an army right okay if you were run out of somewhere-- which you have been after a lot of research-- -- and you were trying to do something-- -- what would be your second place of choosing to go i'm just saying if you're run out of one place for doing something i imagine-- yes i do if they are run out of one place for something my first thing would be try to find the next place to keep it going correct what if she's already been killed in wildmount so many theories you guys so many theories it's kind of exciting we know the briarwoods also did dealings with the stormwinds in wildmount son of a bitch did we see a pyramid when we were in wildmount when we went there and that was up in vasselheim thank you there's a ziggurat on every continent (singing) every continent has a ziggurat it's these damn ley lines i knew there's been something up with these ley lines and i tried to talk to the sun tree about it and he didn't know he's a tree no he's very cool and one of the things i have written down in your room praying yeah desmond (mumbles) briarwood's carriage driver lady briarwood is immune to daylight briarwoods have an army i have it in giant big letters but i don't know what that means i could also maybe plane shift us there with one of these is it worth going back to any of the other ziggurats or no that's true if we jump through the sphere of death they might be expecting us on the other side of the sphere of death if we plane shift we might be able to come up with a flanky secret other tactic i'll talk it over with other magic-users first i don't know i'll find one eskil knows stuff like that he dislikes you even less he just hates everyone oh my gosh we figured out so much stuff delilah might be vecna and all this there are ziggurats everywhere and we're so dumb because we've probably seen several ziggurats and they're all on these massive ley lines and i give him a whole dialogue what do you mean you think if we go in we're never coming back you think if we go in you're never coming back i'll have someone send a message you can't resign to this you can't give up on me i can see it in your eyes you think this is it really everything going on right now and you're worried about my dad typical boyfriend i guess that's fair promise me you'll come back with me no matter what even if it doesn't happen just promise i just need you to believe it sure go find eskil good morning lovely weather today isn't it so how's the research on the shadowfell going all of it all of the research anything we should know anything important fill us in a little bit spark notes used to transport souls give me a second okay i'm going to show him the necklace that we found this seems to have a slight magical attunement to the shadowfell do you think i could use this as a plane-shifting device all right that's very good to know with how much time okay are you able to send messages you have sending yeah just wondering if you could tell my dad that i might be gone for a long time i'd really owe you one eskil just a quick message just to my dad to let him know that i might die attempting to-- korren of the ashari who is one of the headmasters thank you can we maybe borrow your research notes on the shadowfell is that a thing no (sighs) thank you thank you sure you know where to find us what all right enjoy your tea and biscuits thanks eskil apiece or total a lot to unpack here 30 rock soul (giggles) unless we want to go through the old-fashioned way like the cultists did we might take a little bit of damage on the way through it's definitely a large amount of risk-taking already scanlan's back hang on do we want to do a heroes' feast do we need to put on the robes too that we found all right do you want the robes keyleth reaches for vax right as he goes in oh shit oh jesus that's so many dice he twitched again just that that's it all right yeah in 16 and the ziggurat is above us 27 they love holding hands while they were looking at weapons racks and doing stuff like that-- while they were doing that i pull vax aside i grab him-- goddamn it scanlan's back listen you can't die and i don't know what's going on in your head or what you're thinking but i feel like it's not good has the raven queen spoken to you at all recently down here i need you with us not with her i need you with us and with me so let me do this and i'm going to burn my 9th-level spell and cast foresight on vax don't fuck it up man it's my 9th-level spell we look so cool does this city look like whitestone how many are there three yeah
