salesman to contest your roll you can do that right your roll on the bear the bear attacking him oh sorry my knack of the seventh sun ability good good we could probably use him as bait are you asking permission to go speak to whore if you want to go fuck whore go fuck whore you don't have to ask permission don't try and say you're interviewing whore when we know what you want it's only matter of time sudis actually wanted to go talk to dan how do you say name again looking at the aura the energy surrounding you i don't think you'd pull that trigger would you dan what do i do five i'm sorry i

calm do i look aroused i don't-- just the tip dan pull that trigger and it will be the last trigger you pull so says the dark entity behind your shoulder i'm going to use a black chip just to see if i

worry we'll meet again dan as well as the demon on your shoulder bye demon bye-bye (blows kisses) i made like five gold doing that i did not touch that woman i was simply giving her fortune she just tripped one of the other women pulled her down and she tripped and fell it had nothing to do with me not everything is necessarily a pull of fate's strings okay it's sometimes shit just happens just itch bit of itch ah manitou just thinking out loud let's follow i'm on my peg leg simon was it what brings you out here you came quite fast yes yes right before her fist meets his face i go pain incoming see i can predict future schwerenger there we go what they call you cousin or is your name cousin we've got a guy in the street did you recover any he recovers every few hours right ooh i'm still standing next to simon do i hear what he says ugh i'm going to spend a reroll not much better three can i follow simon stealthily like blend in with the crowd behind him i'm not trained in this ooh i rolled a three though which is pretty good minus two so one your palms are very sweaty don't touch again you seem nervous why nervous mayor who made you mayor i know eb i know and i reach out and i touch his face oh don't worry eb i don't have to be in your sights i told you you are only prolonging the inevitable by 30 seconds yeah sometimes people are just meant to die can i do an insight check on sydney nine i told you he was meant to die we need to start at some of the mining locations some of the gold and silver veins i know but i think we should follow it towards one of the mining-- well it's a start i peg leg behind (stomping) what does the moon look like so it's a full moon would i have any occult knowledge about-- --the moon and maybe things come out at the moon times (accented) that is a moon in the skies (dice hitting the floor) oh it was a four can i keep it you're not going to let me keep it three i'm going to spend a blue to add a d6 right ooh and a four so seven the full moon it has mystical powers i'd watch out for any type of lycanthropy in the area you goods you've had those hiccups for-- you shouldn't eat from the traveling street carts those are bad did you also eat from the travelling street cart don't eat from food trucks you fucking-- what well that's fine just straight smarts i'm going to re-roll do i re-roll both or which one the big one that's not great ugh five don't bait me matthew mercer i know what you're doing trying to get me to use all my tokens (growling) yeah the blue one no wait i don't want blue i want a red oh because he gets one right all right i'll just use the blue i already threw it to you i would like a d6 ooh that's good ten you know there are certain things that really like silver when they're also lycanthropes like i don't know do i know things that might like silver i know certain things are afraid of silver they hate silver my immediate thought would be if i was werewolf-- that's what lycanthropes are werewolves if i was werewolf and had vulnerability to silver i'd want to control all the silver so that way no one can hurt me or a bear or it could be other beasts i also saw cy run very quickly right before the moon came out just saying i think we should keep an eye on simon if it's full moon then he's out in beast form we have good chance of finding him in beast form so do you add the d4 and the d6 together three the mines mm-hmm i still say we use him as bait probably wouldn't have i've got a lantern i come in with a lantern come on jules the ladies are leading the way what do we see so they bought the mine simply to-- laura and da all right we should probably get silver-- yeah can we get some silver pieces i'll take the other four pounds 1d4 we should go deeper before we walk off i go sydney catch and i toss him a piece of silver just i thought it'd be good if we all had some i've got the lantern i'm great it was my knee my knee deflected son of a bitch can we use fate chips to redraw cards fucking fuck no i'm going to spend a fate chip to counter your reroll running out of fate chips three on my guts what did you use just roll a d6 2d6 ooh six seven total blue chips i don't have any blue chips to counter hey that's good same thing yeah do it nice how far away are they still far enough away to where i can shout at them sudis will shout if you run only death will come and find you and i'm going to attempt to try and shaken them ooh i rolled an eight with a five so that's 13 plus two 15 i told you i told you should we chase after people who were following us or should we maybe check other silver mines the accent's already rubbing off on you four yeah to whoever did that big money no whammies yeah go laura go are we trying to end the game at one minute i'm going to start walking up to it and i'm going to say tonight is the night that you die and i'm going to attempt to shaken it with my persuasion thing because i have it this i get to just add a d6 to the roll right fucking fuck ooh 11 plus another five so that's 16 how far away am i from it can i walk up to it and make it 20 paces you're going to die no you're not no that a red is not in the cards for you my friend four two wounds or just one wound no i shook it off this is simon doing this is he shaken though thanks chat thank you for that well we only had five minutes left in the stream and 100% of the proceeds from those shirts are going to the mda i wish i had a few more minutes to wreak havoc just a few more is all i needed that was fun what's happening now
