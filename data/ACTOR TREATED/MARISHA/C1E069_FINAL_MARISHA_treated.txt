nicolas cage was scary in gone in sixty seconds just throwing it out there yeah yes and christmas is right around the corner you guys i miss school relay races sorry go ahead nothing don't worry about it keep going well she wasn't forgotten he threw percy's gun into the pool of acid we should collect her guns we need her other hand and we need the vestiges off of her fucking body grog will you do the honors of taking her other hand i have nothing left i have no way to get us out of here quickly right now orthax could have his soul for all we know near ripley's body honestly right now i think-- it sounds crazy that i'm saying this but we have mutual interests with him it might not be the worst idea just like last time and what if he has percy i need to rest i need to sleep i could try and scry her let me see actually but what if you can't get him back out living and willing right we don't want him to get stuck i can't believe that there's nothing we can do right now ugh hang on wait let me see it does it look like the other scrying stone that we have be careful scanlan oh we just got our ticket out of here we might want to save it we could if we knew its name that is how it's different from plane shift i have a feeling the longer we wait the harder it will be but like you said the gate spell could theoretically bring orthax back if we might need to who knows how long has percy been dead it depends on what you're trying to do i have one ability i could use you have to do it within ten days but i'm not necessarily comfortable doing it regardless i don't know i've never done it before and i don't know the ramifications i'd prefer to get him to pike i'll stay with percy keyleth takes percy's body and i drag him over to the table and i lay him out and i start cleaning him and cleaning his wounds as best as i can did you leave your purse yeah we can make a blanket fort that sounds a little weird you guys keyleth also pulls a vex i take out the dagger and i hand it to vex-- to vax sorry i druidcraft little fireflies above us make it all pretty and sleep too yes let's go are we bringing him with us laura and closest biggest fattest tree pike immediately immediately tell them we're coming to prepare quarters yeah she's got to have her earring right to sarenrae's temple whatever we can do to help we just knew we couldn't do this without you is there a better chance with resurrection i pull out ripley's gun and i hand it to pike while she's still in her ritual and see if that has any effect do we try and destroy the gun again do we do this again he's a shadow fiend does that mean we have to kill him on his own turf do we know pike did that right wasn't it a something-evil spell throw it in the circle is it an arcane magic like that pike i can try greater restoration if you want to save your healing magic do you want me to try it i'll try to recreate what pike did to grog i scream percy pike do it hey vex will you look for that raven skull that i gave him while you're at it does he still have the raven skull on him that i gave him i grab the skull from around his neck that i gave him i say percy we had many conversations about life and death and in many ways you were my total opposite but you are also my best friend even though i told you that day that i gave you this that we're all going to die and that you can still be saved from yourself it was clear the journey was far from over and it still isn't and then i'm going to cast conjure woodland beings and i'm going to have a barrage of crows come from around me i'm going to tell him as much as you might think your journey is over just because yours might be ours isn't and we need you and i need you use the gold die percy 19 you said he's still unconscious (hoarsely) did we say the right thing clearly his reflexes are working his reflexes are working great percy you were gone for quite a while how long did it feel i beg to differ what what do you mean you saw what i did did you hear me yell for you percy are you sure do you still feel him you should rest and get better you should sleep and we'll talk more tomorrow no this is still a construction zone i'll go dump a few healing spells and stuff into him let's get you to lie down first you heal 48 hit points by the way oh melee attacks it was worn by the woman who tried to kill you and succeeded whisper your parents are lovely by the way thank you so much again we told them you're doing great and we told them you were doing fantastic and wonderful and successful i've been practicing my juggling to be fair i could use it in my knife juggling yeah no what am i going to do with it do they happen in the same turn they happen in the same turn yeah what now what did they look like how do they know my name it's got something thick in it which isn't-- read the letter first it's long patrick (hoarsely) holy shit i don't know what to say it was kerr it's got branches on it i have passed through fire this is a lot to deal with right now we have friends i have a friend and as kind as his letter was i think something was wrong and i think there's more to his message vex maybe you he scribbled out some words and speaks vaguely in areas around them you sure i worry what do you mean i don't know what to say it's really comforting to know that not everyone hates us i don't think it's a wise idea you literally just rose from the dead yeah he's gone i've cried eight more times thanks vesh yeah you better motherfucker i shoot him daggers whenever his eyes meet mine at one point pike you have to try some i was looking anxiously over at vex when she was-- (chuckles) smartass but now we go forward with the knowledge that we know percy was anticipating dying very foreboding asum i agree he's being really shifty also 27 laura and asum i'm sorry i don't mean to be insistent here but if this is as private of information as you seem to be making it out to be maybe we should go to the room where we know cannot be spied upon fucking you come into our house she's been posing as seeker asum but i also put a bracelet on the actual seeker asum so i should be able to scry on that guy find out where he is hopefully he's not dead and thank you to patrick rothfuss miss you kerr-bear
