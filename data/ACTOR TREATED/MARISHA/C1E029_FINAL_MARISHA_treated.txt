doing what kerrion's healing is it a regeneration thing or is he casting a spell wait he's calling in backup shit oh he's going to dimension door out 22 21 looking up and noticing that sir kerrion is gone and vax is blindly stabbing into the distance i'm going to drop my wolf form and cast faerie fire in that radius 20-foot cube right here realizing my party members are clearly stabbing at something i'll back up a tidbit just back up a smidge yeah sure whatever i can see him now faerie fire always makes it weird miss you've got the amulet on is that the guy who you charmed awesome go percy go percy go that was with advantage pooper percy rolls this against kerrion right could you do it now for flavor not 100% sure what's going on can i take my faerie fire concentration that i still have up and move it over top of the black smoke figure i don't know can i move a faerie fire 20 feet is he in it perchance never mind natural 20 no it's with my staff i'm assuming right unless i wanted to deck him in the face this is with my staff okay so it's five so that's 11 i don't attack a lot 13 damage yeah i just clothesline him i see him running i'm like (grunts) someone write that down what about the dominated guy he's about to save from it domination he can save from it at any second vouk okay but what are we going to do about dominated guy can we tie him up too he could save from that any second we need to like off him or something just knock him out knowing what's coming i'm going to druidcraft some pretty kaleidoscope-y flowers in front of his face pretty image before you die while all this happens i'm going over to baldy lord vouk or mister vouk and pop a cure wounds potion into him how far down is he he was just at zero i brought him to zero yeah all right i'll pop a cure wounds into him i was giving him pretty flowers i gave him pretty flowers to look at i druidcrafted from a distance i drop 18 points of healing into vouk stuff doesn't grow though not like it should what did they do to the land and what exactly are they doing under the castle she's the one who made them natural 20 whoa you would though you would have we also forgotten that this entire town is looking for us they will after we set fire on the house and send a man screaming through the street with your symbol on his forehead they will they're going to go hm let's look at the burning smokestack of a house and start there (voice cracking) yeah but-- yeah hang on fellow half-elves you look as horrified as i feel what do you guys think look i agreed to start a rebellion and let the people have their uprising but i'm with vax i was trying to tell you this before we even came here percy you don't want to become the thing that you are so desperate to seek vengeance on how are we any different than the briarwoods at this point why are things more complicated percy clearly we all just witnessed what just happened yeah no i'd agree with that yeah let's get out of here all right we're setting this damn house on fire i'm going to say all right well if we're going to light this damn house on fire and make it a symbol-- we're at least going to make it cool and make it the message that it's supposed to be i turn into an eagle and i fly to the roof give me your symbol i cast flaming sphere yeah hope you guys were ready to get out i cast flaming sphere and i start moving it around on the roof and start drawing the shape of the de rolo family crest on the roof and i take my flaming sphere and i throw it right at the feet of where the guards are i run over to the edge where the cellar was and i go (whispering) grog grog (whispering) come to the side of the roof (whispering) grog hey (whispering) catch me get the fuck out of here i was going to say do you have pass without a trace can you summon any more spells yeah before we move 25 speaking of percy and his crazy storyline-- i'm guessing by now if you go on the geek and sundry website you can find his playlist i was gonna say music to murder to go check it out it's great taliesin art or burning on rooftops glad i'm not the only one who thinks you're crazy anymore you're all crazy we've all seen it now we can handle it as a family but in the meantime don't forget to go to la2050 and vote for 826la so they can win 100k i was gonna suggest-- we had the hunger games reference so what was his name kerrion or whatever the gamemaster in the first one
