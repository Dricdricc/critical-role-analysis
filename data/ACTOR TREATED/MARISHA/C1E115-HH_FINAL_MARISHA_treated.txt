hi everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role trinket's honey heist oh my god i would like to start off by saying that this is terrifying and that's it so let's get to our announcements really fast i believe we have a sponsor right sam riegel no anything to delay my impending doom okay merch laura knows what's up isn't that right-- oh matt you want to do merch pretty bomb-ass why does it get so weird about books yeah oh we have a weird announcement that came up pretty fast as of yesterday we are married that didn't happen that fast though that was very long that was a lot but we're married now (sam clinking his mug) force grey is coming up i'm jumping in as of yesterday yeah we need one more person we're down a player so i am playing a tortle named clarapin the therrapin pretty stoked or maybe it's terrapin i don't know it's still new i'm still working it out in my head but i think we have a picture of clarapin there's no vetting monitor nothing over there ooh aah that's good old clarapin she's a bard yeah they totally could have teenage mutant ninja-- and moving on from that the critical role podcast is up to episode 70 you can get it on amazon echo echo dot echo plus as well as alexa-enabled devices as well as other-- i should've read the top of that is now available through amazon alexa that was the top part of that vox machina origins is still out we have our big critical role wrap-up on the 14th correct and then of course me taliesin matt and liam are going to be at pax unplugged next friday wednesday club still a thing that would be great you sang in a blizzard promo for a new expansion not today though he is the mayor of blizzcon i think that's pretty much it last but not least i would love to thank joana aka @_sleepyjane for doing the wonderful bear art and then i would like to give a huge shout-out to grant howitt who is the writer and the producer of honey heist as well as several other silly rpg one-shot games you can get this for free that's the amazing thing about this he publishes all of his games for free you can support him which we highly recommend you do at patreoncom/gshowitt yeah and if you can join his patreon you get some cool stuff that you might see so yeah anyway i think oh my god what do you say like without further ado without further ado let us now jump into this trinket's honey heist version of critical role [dramatic music] where we last left off didn't happen so we'll jump right in oh should i go over rules now yeah where we last left off was rules-- before we jump in honey heist is a super simple game everyone is a bear the bear has a special skill we'll see that as we go along you will eventually be getting roles you're trying to heist the mother lode of honey heists so you have two stats your bear stat and your criminal stat you start the game with three points in each of the stats this is a d6-based game so whenever you do anything remotely bear-related you're going to roll your bear stat you want to try and get the number equal to or under how many points you have in bear criminal is anything basically not related to being a bear that's quite literally actually what it says not to do anything directly related to being a bear same thing equal to or under right if the plan's going well i can reward you with a point in criminal you move a point from bear over to the stat conversely if you start getting a little aggravated or the plan starts not working out in your favor you might move a point from criminal into bear the more frustrated you get if you reach six points in either stat you either turn into an insane criminal mastermind betray the party and decide to bounce or you go completely feral as a bear and can't really function being a criminal anymore and you're out so you don't want that to happen just don't jump off any cliffs is my recommendation no it's very cartoonish cartoon physics just don't look down if you decide to walk off a cliff if you feel like you're starting to get a little too bear-y you can flash back to a criminal planning sequence in order to move a point from bear into criminal if you're feeling a little too shady you can eat a nice little snack of honey to move a point from criminal back into bear that's what you guys are good at all right i think we get started no wookiees hereby ban on wookiees this isn't the zombie apocalypse all right it's autumn two years after the defeat of the chroma conclave in westruun we're in westruun the air has that perfect crisp breeze indicative of the chillier months to come the scent of deep-fried festival foods and fermented alcohols radiates heavily from the center of the town square in the opal and market wards the distant sound of string quartets and laughing townsfolk pick up in your ear trinket the immense sense recall spawns the memory in your head and you know this is the happy food festival time this is your favorite time but for some reason vex is walking you away from the festival and toward the bramblewood forest i know buddy but listen i need you to stay here look i can't have you risking sneaking away and giving in to your temptations again pike would kill me and she's already upset at you for clearing out the slayer's cake honey stash the past two times i know but look i promise you if you do this for me buddy i'll come back with a whole load of festival treats all right all right darling okay be good don't get into any trouble okay happy bear and she walks on down the road you are currently on the edge of the bramblewood forest up on a mountain you can kind of see westruun in the distance you can see far off that the city is dressed up in autumn colors and reds and there are wagons being pulled into the city you recalled vex mentioning something about the slayer's cake competing in a competition seems like they've got a lot of competitions they are entering keyleth and pike's prize honey mm-hmm so you know there's a lot of honey as you turn around you hear a few cracks of branches there's a crowd of other bears seem to have been watching the whole time there's a panda that waves yeah you can speak to each other you can kind of mumble through words to humans yeah you can kind of he peeks out from behind peddy tuxpin as you hear the music in the background press on all you can keep thinking about trinket is that massive stash of honey hiding right behind the walls of the hazel festival she's pretty far gone at this point over the mountain she doesn't seem to be paying any attention to you okay roll a bear you get advantage yeah all right right now there's a lot of fried foods you know at ren faire when that mead smell and dirt kind of like that that's all you've got right now it's a little too much right now you begin to make your plan peddy why don't you go ahead and roll a d6 this will determine your role peddy peddy tuxpin you're the muscle of the group i'd say roll a bear-off you get advantage peddy taliesin and without fail peddy like a sprig of bamboo snaps all the way back do you feel aggravated you agreed to it you're fine not yet roll d6s do you want to still also be a muscle or would you like to re-roll all right cookie you're the brains of the group waffle you're the hacker (laughter) yes write your roles down what do you know how to do liam las vegas you're the driver you're going to have to pick up a ride all right trinket you're the last one it's anything-- a five you're a thief did you bring any bamboo mm nah you also like to eat anything that kind of remotely resembles bamboo trinket your ears pick up in the distance hats get your hats he's about a hundred yards away entering into the south entrance of the city about to cross the threshold all right liam you-- las vegas goddamn you vegas you skitter on down past using the rocks and the fauna to dodge as you get up close behind the guy cookie and waffle were you guys-- all right waffle and cookie flank from the sides as you start getting up to the wall of the city you see two guards standing at the entrance nodding and greeting people letting them go in as they go you see a few banners hung up along the wall few flowers couple of guards yeah couple of shields there's maybe one or two coming in families coming in and filtering into the city for the festival most people seem to be inside kids are currently open season yeah you see a mom and dad two kids typical looking family out for a nice day you see another kid going along in with one of the vendors they've got some vegetables on their back liam las vegas as this is happening you get up right behind you follow in you're about maybe five feet out from the back of theobald the bold the best hat vendor in town theobald the bold is because his hat's the boldest he's a little halfling dude with scrappy clothes but his hat looks way overpriced in comparison to everything else he's hunched he's got a pull-behind wagon piled with hats get your hats festival hats all right as this is happening you start hacking the banner roll for criminal that's a double if you're a hacker all right you're a little tangled in them the pendants are getting in your face a little bit what are you doing cookie the kids (terrified screaming) about this time the dad goes guards bears get help about this time one of the guards looks over at the other one and goes aw glennon we have a bear attack they start running after you banging their shields against the spears going (yelling) get away aw they're those shit-flinging bears glennon (yelling) they're trying to block it roll for criminal roll for bear i guess you are being more of a bear than the brains right now you successfully fling shit as the guards try to duck and cover one gets hit right in the right eye and he's like aw and they start jabbing at you guys with spears they chase you off probably a good 50 or so yards off around the corner i think those bears were rabid pretty sure but we probably should have put them down they slowly walk back in this time-- how many hats you could probably do a few darts and hide a few in this time roll for criminal about this time in the distraction-- yeah you got a nice solid haul as you're trying to go for your bonus hats theobald turns around and goes rats there's bears and rats get out he stomps at you aw look he knocked over my hats starts scooping up the ones little bit oh you're attacking roll 2d6 and roll for the lowest under bear you have carnage okay theobald goes (yelps) and takes off running a few more fall off and you take the extra hatsyou guys all slowly get back you reconvene that actually went off pretty well considering so you guys each put a point into criminal waffle cookie and liam las vegas take one away from bear put it into criminal everyone roll a d8 a d8 please three sixes you two sixes reroll because this is the one hat that i only have one of you roll twice you get two hats you'll get a fez and one more hat so roll again what did you roll five two what color top hat would you like black green and a leathery tan trinket you get a trilby what did you roll again liam las vegas which cowboy hat do you want you get a second hat roll again because a six is still a fez roll again what color bowler you get to wear a hat on a hat if you want fez on a bowler there you go a fowler you guys are feeling pretty good about your hats that's a good code name with that confidence you stroll right on up see if you can test your luck with the guards i guess they're like giant pendants that you put holes in so you've got nice little ascots now very distinguished very festive as you walk by the one guard was like aw jeez do i still have shit in my eye oh welcome to the hazel festival sirs go on in jeez can we go get wet wipes were those goliaths okay let's go take a break you successfully enter the city is my music going as you get closer into the city you can smell wonderful foods you can see people bringing in prized vegetables and they're entering them into competitions there's string quartets and people dancing in the streets mead vendors out in the open as you get closer you actually see a three-story-tall really derpy-looking statue of a westruun man with a cowboy hat he's wearing a button down that looks a lot like the texas state flag he's got a shitty voice box saying welcome to the hazel festival welcome to the hazel-- and it repeats every 30 seconds or so things are decorated around it cookie waffle you notice the scent of honey wafting through the air peddy tuxpin you notice the scent of bamboo in the air it's a little dried out and as you look down you notice these little wooden bamboo sample spoons that have been discarded all over the floor it tastes like it's got honey residual on it it's scraps but there's some little drops of honey in sample cups all right you guys taste some roll for bear taliesin and are you getting a little frustrated then take and put a point into bear it's got to be lower than bear about this time you see an old couple run by going help has anyone seen any cows we lost our prized steer she's like gerald i told you you should have tied them up as they run by you see pike way off in the distance she's saying anyone would like a honey sample honey sample anybody this is from the slayer's cake vote for the slayer's cake on the other side you see reginald's daughter what was her name aleria it's somewhere in my notes but it's reginald's daughter and she's going honey samples try it from the reginald farm honey samples still really trying to find her damn i just wrote down reginald's daughter ameera or something aleria or amelia we'll call her amelia she looks at you a little confused and goes hello she turns around to a friend and is like i'm not one to judge but-- she shuffles away a little uncomfortable about this time you see the last and third contestant in the honey competition wandering on the opposite side of the fountain he's going yes vote for me it's victor v stands for voting it's a secret recipe try my secret recipe trinket you get this waft in the air and you're looking at the honey it's got this grayish tint to it you recognize this is the same smell that comes out of percy's boom-boom tube a decent amount a decent amount people are all over the place they're mixing in they're going to pike and then they're going to victor then they're going to reginald's daughter they're jumping around vote for v hello there hairy fellow would you like some honey oh you like it a lot big guy okay and he starts scooping it into the hat remember vote for me though the v stands-- vote for me which direction are you guys going you may certainly have honey it's good all things considered it's a little smoky taste to it still tastes like honey just a little sulfury it's gritty it's got a little bit of crunch in your teeth huh you have to have a nice pawful you've got to get a-- a sample's not going to work once again you might want to stockpile some honey it's not a bad idea you hear a carnival barker come out on the stage built temporarily on the town square he goes welcome everyone the fire ashari cultural dance troupe (drumbeat) fire spinners come out and start doing fire poi fire breather comes out over the crowd everyone's like yeah they go rushing up to the stage drunk people are like yeah look at this little guy you see a roaming free-wandering chicken that comes up and you can tell it's eating any and all trash that it comes across on the floor as a spark of ash a piece of flint flies off the fire dancers and falls in front of it chicken eats it mindlessly (squawk) it explodes and bursts into a poof of feathers everyone turns looks over in your direction all right you can smell that it's coming from the opal district a little bit a really nice tavern called the sun kissed inn in that direction you bears split off into a back alleyway and start following cookie and waffle yep neither do i she's real busy right now people are dancing and they're cheering they're eating the honey really stoked roll 2d6 under bear and take the lower kids immediately get snapped out of their dancing trance drunk people instantly sober everyone screams and takes off running into the other direction you can tell a low level one person goes (groaning) and makes flame but nothing really comes out (yelling) she screams and runs off that was a successful criminal action so point from bear to criminal you see pike off in the distance start looking and moving people out of the way what do you mean a bear what did the bear look like she is demanding from other people that are screaming in panic right now you've successfully wreaked havoc you hear a few guards call out those bears got in the city damn it o'donnell keep moving the rest of you bears you sneak off go around heading your way towards the tavern peek around a corner look left look right you see a discarded wheelbarrow a few discarded carts some trash you veer off you take a closer look one's a little pull-behind cart that has shoulder straps it'd be one of the bigger ones there's a wheelbarrow looks tinier made of wood but you might be able to maneuver it it looks like a little kid wagon is basically what it is you push on the cart a little bit wheel falls off and collapses looks like it's been there for a while as it collapses behind that is a shiny chrome metallic little black detailing racing stripes on the side-- it's like a little radio flyer wagon it in fact does say de rolo on it roll a criminal check as you're trying to be stealthy it's bigger than a honeypot it's a radio flyer it's a little wagon yeah success you shift some things aside you hear a rustle from the house don't move for a second george george goddamn my piece of shit husband she wanders off you can continue (squeaking) liam las vegas comes back you're all stealthing keep moving down the alleyways you're eating the trash along the way there's a few foliage and trees that look bamboo-y there's a few cattail rods and fronds that are not too bad not yet actually about this time as you guys come around the corner you run coming down the alleyway right into trinket out of one of the side alleys as you guys are having this conversation you hear (clopping) see that i'm fucking dee bradley baker up in here yeah i did i didn't plan those i didn't practice those ahead of time it's not too bad totally you see two silhouettes coming out of the shadows also wearing hats one has horns coming out of it two cows also trying to pass as civilians come up to you and go well well well what do we have here it looks like we got ourselves a couple of wise bears they're holding a stick like it's a tommy gun but it's definitely a stick look wise guy i'm a prize cow do you know who we are we're the blue ribbon winners here at the hazel festival yeah that's right and you know what me oh this here is bonnie she goes hi you tell them cow he goes that's bonnie and i'm cow we're tired of living like second-class livestock you hear they're holding sticks like tommy guns it's balanced it's tucked up under oh do we do we like grass are you going to start telling me about myself now look at these guys bonnie yeah you tell them cow yeah all right you know what you bears you get to enjoy your honey you get to enjoy all these fruits and all these bamboos and we get stuck with hay and i'm just here to say we're tired of it aren't we bonnie yeah is that a threat is that supposed to be some sort of hamburger threat i get it i'm a cow i've heard them all all right you want to throw down that honey's ours all right let's throw down he did they look pretty good they look like some pretty tasty-looking sticks they're still green he dropped it on the floor as you bite down on the stick-- --you realize there's actually something a little bit different about this stick it has a shimmer to it it's not as easy to bite through you realize this is actually a magic stick yeah you can certainly try it's a stick that when you use it it turns into a giant whacking trunk yeah no wait what oh i gave you the wrong one that's what you needed you now have it bonnie and cow go moo and start trying to stampede you all what do you do roll for criminal roll for being a cow hacker you're cow hacking he doesn't fall for it he tramples right over you you get knocked prone on the ground you get aggravated and take a point in bear all right do fastball special land on top of him get a nice little foam going in the mouth it's good roll 2d6 you start tearing at the throat of cow poor cow didn't know what was coming to him scruff is getting-- he goes down pretty good bonnie turns and goes what no you monsters and she turns and goes for you trinket roll for terrify she goes you'll pay for this she grabs cow and starts trying to drag him off it's going to take time it's pretty sad actually just the one stick there is another stick it is just a stick though okay i'd say you get a point in bear for that you did some pretty good bear stuff this go-round you would move a point into criminal and you would also move a point into criminal because your plan succeeded you actually do recognize this branding this is from the old couple that vox machina saved their bears from being eaten from rocs matt and their cows yeah what did i say oh sorry cows the same old couple that you saw earlier running through looking for their lost cows okay you use the stick and as you rear it back it turns into a giant tree trunk basically that comes toppling down right on her head roll for criminal wait no bear okay (impact) a little blood splatters-- she had a tree fall on her and then after a second it goes back to a stick you peek down the alleyway a little bit people are still pretty cleared out of the town square from where everyone was looking for a giant bear that's now running loose in the town you see a few knocked-over jars of the sample honey it would be risky but there's some honey not too far roll for criminal you scoop up as many as you can move a point from criminal to bear and i'd say you can probably bear-handle two more jars of honey awkwardly sure move a point does anyone else want to eat anything you good yeah i'd say you've still got a pretty good scent on it you hear a few guards in the distance shouting it's kind of inaudible clear seems people are definitely looking all right what about you waffle flashback (flashback noises) you can get a point in criminal back just him i'd say if you want to switch a point since you were part of that go ahead from bear to criminal and it actually gives you a pretty good idea waffle since the town is kind of empty right now you walk by a little news stand that has tobacco and hand-rolled cigarettes okay okay i'll allow it to just happen just because of the ridiculousness it's an obnoxiously large flame for what you're trying to do but-- go ahead and put another point into criminal from bear it's pretty good it feels pretty good you guys keep moving doing pretty good as you come around a corner down an alleyway you see a little kerfuffle going on and you see two bigger kids just sucker-punching on this little kid and they're taking honey samples and smearing it in his hand a lot of it it's victor just smearing it into his hair you hear the kid screaming hey hey stop it stop it you guys seriously my dad's going to kick your butt he was like (sneering) ah turns around shit you guys hey jordan jordan look it's a ferret let's capture him the kids start trying to capture you roll for carnage go ahead roll for bear plus one oh shit (laughs) the kid grabs you successfully the other kid turns sees you he's like oh shit shit jordan it's those bears and starts taking the wooden play sword that he got at the festival and just starts beating you with it take a point in bear also take a point in bear as the kid's holding you and you're just (struggling sounds) how are you going to hack that sword you're really pushing that hacker thing aren't you you know once again i'll allow it based on the shitty english language two dice under bear okay the sword breaks in half he's like oh shit it's the other bear what i feel like-- george what's he trying to say as he's distracted-- oh the other kid that was being bullied comes up with his prop sword and he goes (whack) and comes down right over the top of the first kid who is holding you he turns to the second kid they're like aw shit man come on let's get out of here and they take off ugh you just scraped my knee (crying) mum as you flick the cigarette you see one of victor's sample cups go-- --(ignition sounds) it goes (sparking sound) like a bottle rocket he's got this cowlick-- he's sore and he's like-- wow you know i really feel like you guys are trying to talk to me this is great you guys saved me oh i got saved by bears no one's going to believe me that's right fuzzy bear hey are you guys-- you guys want some honey i know where there's a lot of honey okay see my dad is the head of security he's the head of-- so he knows where all the honey is hiding and he told me that there's a code and he made me collect a bunch of fish for it and it wasn't very fun but there's a secret code i can tell it i can show you where my dad is it's so cool having bear friends okay if you go around the corner and go up there right next to the sun kissed inn my mum likes drinking there a lot if you go over next to the sun kissed inn there's an alley behind it and there's a door that goes up to the side and that's where the head of security is okay have fun bye and he runs off (giggling) mum and he runs off if you would like to flashback (flashback sounds) and you're back go ahead and put a point from bear into criminal well you can always eat the honey and then you also take a point from bear into criminal okay now you can move that point back you've got a jar and a half i'd say yeah three more it's close that sounds accurate and with that we will take a break as always stay tuned for the wonderful brian foster's codeword so you can win some shit i don't know what you're going to win but you're going to win some shit and we're going to take a break and we'll be right back i guess welcome back to trinket and peddy tuxpin's honey heist we have a winner for brian's wood which is hawkwinter01 matt and yeah sounds like a marvel character sponsored by marvel puzzle quest got to catch them all and then you sam quick catch-up announcement we've got some pretty awesome people who are going to be on it you can donate to oxfam to help them out no all right criminal bear posse you're right back in your cloaks your ascots your hats your pull-behind de rolo roller not doing too bad and a cart roll for bear (laughter) you successfully pee on wheels much better you are leaving a bit of tracks but it dries in a while it's good all right you guys keep moving ducking down alleyways turning and looking like bears and people as you need to at one point in the distance you hear oh no we found the jamesons' lost cows hey can we get a really big wagon that happens in the background it has people distracted for a little bit it seems you keep moving as you come around the corner you see across one of the main thoroughfares the sun kissed inn looks pretty fancy looks nice you're in the opal ward right now it's got a nice glow coming up over the logo you're getting some pretty strong wafts right through the front door of the sun kissed tavern for sure yeah roll for hacker roll for criminal it's under criminal all right you get a good sniff a good waft it's a little musty a little bit of fresh laundry dryer sheets you go over and see rat droppings down one side i'm painting a picture here you go through and the smell comes from this dank air passageway over in the corner but your scent leads you in another direction and it jettisons to the left and it goes up to the right and you see up in this attic loft a security room and that's all you can see and it snaps you back into reality i'll take beast master you've got a main thoroughfare in front of you off to your left you've got the town center where you guys were harassing and terrifying people there's a nice fountain in the middle of it fall foliage in the water of the fountain still pretty rough-looking from where there was a mass clearing out of people from the bear attack according to the guards and then off the main road there's the sun kissed inn it's a nice white building looks like it's been pretty well-kept on the bottom floor there's a tavern on the upstairs there's a little inn you can stay at a little bed-and-breakfast it's got nice white columns a little swinging wood sign says sun kissed tavern with a sun rising up over top of the title when you keep looking down the main road you see another alley-- no wait it's this way you see an alley that jettisons off to the left of the tavern that looks in the direction that his hacker sense was taking him you've got a catty-corner dart a little dizzy it wears off in a second you can see the entrance from where you are in this alley this alley main street another alley across the street and down that way you can see the entrance of the alley but you can't see down it maybe you've got to make it to the alley everyone roll for criminal to stealthily cross the street without being seen okay yeah i was going for a matt mercer skill challenge where half had to do good don't worry about it yeah half succeeded yeah you're an uneven number i'll allow it anyway you guys crossed the street and now you're in the alleyway at the end of it you see a black nondescript iron door it's a little open brick brick building do you want to peek in there's a little stoop yes there is some piping yeah you could make a tree there's some piping and it goes up there's a little window that doesn't seem to have much of a purchase and then there is a balcony on the front of the tavern that looks like it leads to some suites okay so as you bears are hiding in the alley you take this pipe and climb up it roll for bear bear climbing you get halfway up the pipe and it's too slippery and you lose purchase and you go (sliding noise) and slide all the way back down okay so you were not feeling too bad about falling off the post and then these assholes started making fun of you and now you're getting a little irritated put a point in bear from criminal move a point from criminal to bear you kill that last jar-- the first half jar of honey-- to calm down a little bit all right peddy roll for criminal nice it goes and you get a big trunk lopsided and it crashes into the balcony a little bit but it gets there and then gets a little tree growth at the end it's not bad an oak a silver maple brown no this looks like-- okay you start gnawing at the base of the tree as you're climbing peddy can't help himself you get up to the top of the balcony you scurry up the tree peek in the first window empty suite nicely made hotel bed no pretty empty no honey samples there is another window up further from it on the balcony out yeah it's cracked you peek up carefully after these guys yelled at you and as you peek up you see a room it looks like it's a hotel suite that's been taken over temporarily for the hazel festival it's covered in black curtains there's a little sliver of curtain that you're peeking through inside you see square scrying mirrors lined up along the wall papers a writing desk and a man in a security uniform-- westruun colors of course-- walking back and forth pacing looks like he's talking over an earpiece surprised that hadn't happened sooner las vegas you see him look over his shoulder and he frustratedly goes get on out of here go away i'm busy and he goes back and starts looking back into the mirrors occasionally being like any sign of them anyone find those goddamn bears ugh goddamn it you see him leave the room trinket you start hearing-- okay he goes all right all right he throws open the door what goddamn it you guys i think the bears are rabid and i think they're trying to talk to me i think i've got one right here i'll be goddamned okay the poor guy gets flanked from behind the open door he gets slammed with an iron door to the face as a panda bear comes out from the other side and right as he sees this big black-and-white face come around the corner liam las vegas comes from behind and gets him in the back in the nape of the neck roll for bear you get carnal advantage okay he's distracted by you i don't think you understood the term dollars and you waved dopily and he is now grabbing onto your scruff fighting and he slams the back of his head into the wall beating you up a little bit take a point in bear a point from criminal to bear hack the ear okay all right roll for criminal sure ear hacking okay the guy is thrashing around too much as you go to reach for his ear he immediately sucker-punches you in the jaw take a point into bear liam you hear-- liam las vegas you hear since you're right up on his neck you hear over the earpiece very faintly hey boss okay we're heading your way boss boss come in boss you hear boss buford i mean no offense but have you been drinking again buford slams you up against the wall again what are the rest of you all doing okay roll for terrify with advantage under your bear stat he goes all right just i'll let you go did you just say 'where' holy shit all right look it's down there go through the sun kissed inn go into the cellar room there's a door you've got to get on the other side of it look just-- here and he pulls out of his back pocket i fucking hate this job anyway it's a piece of shit go get the honey all right he looks at the badger and he goes here he doesn't know what you're doing so in another attempt pulls out a honey sample from his pocket and goes here and he throws it behind your shoulder to get you to run away how are you going to lock it it's pretty smooth on the outside seems like most of the locking handles are from the other side you did summon a giant tree trunk as you're holding the door you hear (thudding) hey come on from the other side okay roll two because you're the muscle as the door swings back open he's met with a giant panda bear head he gets whacked in the head and falls unconscious immediately sure you don't find any you do find an old biscuit looks like he put it in his pocket from this morning it's a little style a little stale not style it's a little stale it's an everything biscuit like an everything bagel but an everything biscuit well the sun kissed inn the entrance is out and through the front door it's not this appears to be separate leading up you open the door you look behind the guy unconscious on the floor are you going to do anything with his body he does have keys on his body yes you can take those keys yeah okay this is literally just a stairwell entrance it's very thin clearly there for service and bringing in stock it's a narrow little room there seems to be a cupboard under the stairs if you want to stash him there there's a thin stairwell that goes up and opens up into a loft area there's one door that looks like it was suite 1 and another door that looks like it was suite 2 where this was as you guys enter in you open the room you see four screens they're all scrying mirrors a few notes a few papers binoculars a few bottles of mead looks like buford was having a good time it is honey mead you do i would say you put a point back into bear from criminal you are a little tipsy though for a little bit i don't know how terrifying you might be for a little bit wow holy shit that definitely qualifies as a flashback to being a criminal get a point back from bear to criminal you're good they are you look at one of them the first one is the town square the second one looks like the entrance to the tavern you see a few people passed out drunk at tables and a lot of action going on the other two there's codes in the corner it says s-c-r-y-c-a-m-s-l-r-1 wait c-l-r-1 and c-l-r-2 it's not important (laughter) there's town square tavern cellar room one cellar room two that's all you need that's what's blinking in the corner of each of these cameras mirrors scrying mirrors all right try to hack the mirrors you want to throw them on a loop that's pretty good all right hacker bear roll for hacking sure as you're hacking you get a waft of air from one of the vents off to the side and it brings you back to the pipes in the tunnels and in your cracked-out state you somehow connect to the mainframe and it takes you through and you see the tavern and you see two people passed out drunk and you go through into the first room and you see a few tripwires that seem to be strung out across the long hallway and then you go into the last room and you see three pedestals with a bunch of honey stacked onto these pedestals it's very dimly lit but you recognize the shape of fucking honey barrels you go back and you see matrix code go in front of you and lights fly by you see a bunch of worker bees in a hex pattern that looks code-y it's a little green a little black like dos the rest of you see waffle get a little nosebleed as you snap back you look and you saw one guard walk by in the town square entrance about 30 seconds same guard walks by it seems through whatever magic that you have tapped into you have been a little touched by the security cam security hacking you have to be able to see the honey he comes back and waffle's got a little gloss to his eyes a little bit of a green glow crosses them that's good because right as you walk out onto the balcony you see that guard who was walking through that you captured on your loop start walking around going hey boss boss you here he's walking under the balcony looking like he's going to go around that alleyway up to that door roll for criminal aim as you try to time pushing peddy tuxpin you accurately with great precision teabag this poor guard and fall right on top of him he's not dead he's definitely unconscious though he quite literally does not know what hit him (giggles) you quickly and as swiftly as you can-- for a group of bears-- climb down the tree and dart and make your way into the front room you get the flyer get it in you are now into the front tavern bar room of the sun kissed inn bear i guess i don't know you miss and it goes and lands on the roof of the storage room next door it's not the most immediately visible thing you all are in the front room of the tavern it's the late afternoon there's no one in the tavern anyway especially now there's one really old guy passed out in the front right-hand corner seems like he's been there probably since last night you hear a commotion and clanking of pots and pans of chefs and workers in the back in the kitchen getting things ready for the evening anticipating it will probably be a busy day in the hazel festival yeah there is honey in there it is drowned out by the smell of a stockroom of honey that is coming from the back left-hand corner of the tavern which is the entrance to the pantry into the cellar guarding that front initial doorway into the pantry which leads into the bottom cellar is with a pint in his hand a passed-out grog grog the herd technically of the emon strongjaws trinket recognizes him immediately there's the bar there's a door that goes into the pantry and then there's a little booth and bar tables right off to the left of the door looks like he was placed there probably told to watch out for people coming in and out of the pantry and proceeded to drink a lot and pass out instead he's in a little chair propped up at a bar table right to the left of the entrance snoring loudly no what cards oh i don't either sure as you peek out there's a few abandoned vegetable carts people that were there to sell their goods and their wares for the festival there's one that looks like it was a pull-behind churro cart and there is one cart that still has a horse attached to it that looks like at this point he's eating all of the vegetables that are completely unattended right now due to the pandemonium okay how would you like to do that yeah you totally look like a young jason charles miller okay you see the same guard that was walking by is currently pounding on the door you can hear him on the door that you guys came from that led up to the security room you can hear him going chief boss man hello the guy he's far enough away he's not paying any attention to you right now he's trying to get in yeah that's fucking awesome roll for carnage you get advantage without any hesitation he doesn't even know what came a theatrical amount of blood sprays on the door in front and he slowly drops smears down against the wall he's dead he's definitely dead roll for criminal you get a point from bear into criminal for sure you know those stockrooms how you have an open half-door you can see that there's a walk-in pantry and through the walk-in pantry there's a little cellar door wooden it's got a circular dowel rod across it no but you know it's through that door you can also smell a little bit of honey coming from the pantry room as well not a lot you can go over and take a little bit of time get some leftover vegetables and lead the horse pulling the cart these guys are figuring this out while you're doing that yeah there's a few and there's a couple of empty pint glasses on grog's table (snores) yes i am the grand poobah you want to wake him up okay you throw a cup (crash snorts) that's my ale about this time waffle gets another little nosebleed roll for it you see waffle go (sparking) and in a hex techy-looking glow he goes (zap) and teleports to the broken honey in the pantry you go (boop) and squeeze out a little turd as you get a little aggravated you take a point in bear it's got a thick dowel rod across it and it's got a chain on top of that wrapping it up for extra security yeah make a stealthy let's make this a criminal roll you're criminally trying to sneak past grog yeah i'll allow it he does actually appear to be wearing some sunglasses yeah it seems a little odd they look like they were maybe festival glasses they're half hanging off his face right now okay roll a criminal check as you get the glasses off his face he goes oh shit it's a fuzzy goliath and gets up (roars) he growls back sam and you want to wrestle he's drunk and he takes a big swing at you okay roll a muscle roll roll with advantage you successfully wrestle grog he's pretty drunk he's not too hard to get to the ground he's now on his back squirming yes i am grand poobah de boink de boink you poobah too oh brother (fake sobbing) try to pick the lock pretty good i'd say by this point you open the door to see peddy on top of another guy that looks kind of like a panda and you're not sure if it's bad or good if you tell a flashback you get to gain a point into criminal countless hours you have practiced in the middle of the night just trying to learn how to pick a lock prove to us trinket that you can (clang) the whole thing snaps from the inside because you're a bear but it successfully goes (creak) about this time grog goes poobah i missed you so-- (snores) and passes back out all right you do get an interesting essence from the sunglasses you look awesome you see a bar you see a tavern and then right as you look past the cellar holy shit you can see past that cellar door you see tripwires you turn and look over your shoulder outside out through the tavern exit and you see a dwarf-sized woman turn and swing open the door of the tavern hey i see you i can see you and i can understand what you're saying i can hear you i can't-- that's not-- okay what are you all doing all right where did you-- wait a second you do this is tova the werebear okay all right big guy all right this is the first time that you're seeing her she's wearing a nice slick suit it's very good it's very clean-cut looks like she's got a nice festive pin no it's a nice wool it's good you look good too trinket what do you think you're doing i heard rumor that there's a bunch of bears running around of course it's vex's dumb bear well look what kind of trouble are you getting into you guys are going for the honey do i want-- (laughs) all right you all clearly don't know who you're talking to and who you're getting involved with all right look i am part of a super-secret society that is dedicated to protecting bears all across tal'dorei one of the most decorated members it's called the high bear nation all right it's not bad right we take honey and other fruits and vegetables steal them from people who don't really need them and make sure that bear families across all of tal'dorei are taken care of and never go without honey every year this stupid hazel festival that they always make me work security for i decided i'm going to take all this leftover food that all these people always end up with i'm going to take it for high bear nation give it to the bears who truly need it no look these are needy people and the high bear nation takes care of all of us all right i will get plenty of honey out of this you all put in work for this i don't think you guys understand i was part of the planning committee to make sure that the security was all right so here's the deal since you all seem to have gotten pretty far the whole town's out looking for you i can easily call one of the guards turn you all in right now or you help me out i could use extra hands to carry out some of this honey you'll get your own little cut and you'll all become members of the high bear nation enough to last you for a while i know how much honey is in there that's not how-- a good hogshead's worth for each of you how's that sound all right you get to put a point back into criminal for that from bear to criminal yeah you an honest bear no you look like a honey badger here's the deal we're going to go through these doors there's going to be three tripwires that's what they're called tripwires there's also going to be a security cam in here we want to be careful they're watching us wow that's pretty impressive all right you guys are pretty good criminal bears all right these tripwires though anyone good at disarming yeah we'll figure it out when we get in let's go you throw open the door and see a long hallway three haphazardly across the hall tripwires they're long cylindrical glowing a bit green you take a little bit of dust liam las vegas and they show up a little bit better then they go back to their dull transparent look like fishing wire you can certainly try i tried to think up bear puns for all of our sayings and i couldn't find any natural ones nice okay you go up to the first one and you see an energy box off to the side it's got a washer keeping it closed you tilt that to the side see the mechanical mechanism on the inside (pop) you got through tripwire one two more to go (sizzling) (weak sizzling) you can try and hack it all right roll two it's got a little box you go in instead of messing with the mechanical trip wire you see almost a microchip on the inside you touch it and it goes (zap) one more all right you and you take points in criminal tova's like all right good work you get down to the other end of the hall you get to the other end of the hall unharmed by a swarm of bees that's what would have happened if you would've tripped them you get to the other end of the hall and there's a hex-shaped door that's closed in front and right off to the right of it is a large pedestal made out of bluish marble and there's a recess in the middle of this pedestal making a bowl there are also four little baskets on either side no okay yeah sure i already know what it is i helped them to design it i just don't know the actual code they ended up going with here look she goes over to it and she passes her hand over it and it goes (buzzing) and starts glowing and then holographic fish appear in the center of it you will yeah yeah i help him sound it out as you say this tova puts her hand over again (electronic song in korean) wait someone has to wear the bear hands because i made them get them so it's even funnier one at a time you've got to have the bear hands yay i got it from south korea no no guards he looped the footage he did pretty good oh no he's out okay as you start getting irritated you get a point in bear liam las vegas come on liam las vegas it's got to be orange oh the doors behind take a point in bear and with that the hex-shaped doors open up and behind the doors-- big mystery where's the mystery mysterious yeah that's good behind the door you see a dimly lit cellar room a waft of cool air blasts by you you see a few bar tables that have been tossed over clearly left in here for storage a few bags of grain and in the middle on discarded bar tables-- there are three tables the first one has a little note that says slayer's cake it's got a nice couple of small half-barrels of honey the second one says reginald's daughter whatever her name is has a note i think it was something like that ariana whatever third one in scribbled red lettering says victor and there's so much honey in actual boar heads that's oozing out some's dripping off the side of the table and then you follow the drip down and see more hogs' heads goat heads you see a bear head pretty much looks like any type of head he could find he got it and put gray ichor-y sulfuric-smelling honey you see four torch sconces on the walls lightly puttering you follow and you see holy shit victor brought way too much fucking honey and the entire edge of the cellar room is filled with weird heads of honey precarious nope it looks like torch sconces that they dipped in kerosene a long-burning torch they probably lit them when they were bringing in the honey and then walked out there is one that's right over the table of victor's that looks like it's a miracle it hasn't honestly exploded yet tova is she sees the same thing she's a little confused as to why you're acting this way what why why would you-- who would do that she walks over takes a little okay let's go and she starts scooping up honey and throwing them into the radio flyer de rolo roller okay are you still wearing the sunglasses peddy you get a little bit of an advantage because at this time you look up and you see through the roof of the cellar very quick shadowed movement put a point back into bear she goes smooth about this time (thud) and through the floorboards from above they splinter and from the other side and two bears in black gis and ninja masks fall through liam you look over your shoulder las vegas and around the corner are two more bears coming in through the hall that you all just entered too tova looks up she sees them and she goes shit it's the bearracuda yes there's one on the left closest to the door fractured and got knocked over by one of the splintering floorboards and is now swinging above all of the honey okay roll for bear unfortunately as you try to stamp it out with the board the other floorboard catches on fire and now you have two flame sources as you try to roll it out you have two bear ninjas swiping above you what do you do okay use your nimble bear abilities as a honey badger straight bear roll yeah okay one of them gets a good slap on you bounce off the wall you get aggravated point into bear okay roll with advantage you take the first one and you sandwich him with your weight up against the wall he's trying to fight you off okay roll for criminal to use the stick okay unfortunately as you're sandwiched up against him when you try to use it you don't really get good leverage so you go (bop) with a dead stick it doesn't really work it's still forcing against you tova reaches in the back of her suit and she pulls out a little throwing hammer throws it let me roll for tova tries and succeeds hits the first ninja it gets a little distracted what are you guys doing you've got the ninjas kind of warded off two more coming in from where they were after liam las vegas yeah they're not too distracted with you okay roll again okay yeah roll for bear sam and unfortunately as you-- you back up and as you back up you bump into the table of victor's honey and it goes (crash) and spills flammable honey all across the floor the other two bearracudas come in squaring off okay roll for bear attack all right you take one of them two big haymaker swipes they try to block with their bear katanas and miss and he gets two big gashes right across his face he's a little disoriented you've got one more that's in there he's pretty unattended roll for bear no you try to get a nice overhand but it slips a little bit and you have this weird spiraling arc of flammable honey that goes everywhere you do hit one of the ninjas with a decent amount of honey gets a little disoriented backs into one of the torch sconches sconces lights on fire (yelping) he backs up trips blinded by the fire falls onto the ground the fire starts following the spilled honey and then suddenly everyone time slows down tova sees what happens she turns to everyone and goes run and takes off through the door waffle is gone you see the fire getting closer and closer oh shit there are one is now released free one is on fire the other is distracted by your scratching and there was one that tova was squaring off she got pulled through the door okay roll for bear attack also roll for your muscle strength so you get advantage oh no you knock over the last remaining free bearracuda he falls right into the flaming honey immediately bursts into flames-- way more than probably would actually happen you scootch back roll to avoid the flame you do take a point into criminal for what you just did as you back up peddy you see trying to bolt for the door grabs tova throws her right back into you you guys boing so now it's you and tova you're out yeah a hundred percent you all have a good solid four to five more seconds of slo-mo time (whoosh) peddy's out tova's like what the fuck okay roll for bear you guys trip trinket as you push you turn and you see (flame noises) and in slow motion (explosions) you make one more bounding leap as the explosion blows you out of the cellar door you are jettisoned with the cellar door an exploding round of fire comes barreling down the hall burning all of the oxygen-- that's how fire works-- in the room as it blasts out of the door everyone is safe but there is no trinket flames die down you look in the hallway and there a little singed flaming fur with some bald spots is trinket still alive you're unconscious the ninjas all seem to be dead roll for yeah roll for bpr roll for bear yeah you got it you're good it's a really odd-looking sight no one's sure what exactly is happening trinket you do wake up about this time liam las vegas you see all the guards running up the alley coming in this direction the sun kissed tavern is up in flames right now you see another bald panda bear stumble out oh shit it's grog wakes up from everything what are you guys doing tova runs over she jumps into the back of the cart come on trinket you're the only one are you on with a crack of the whips you all speed off down into an empty alleyway tova yells trinket i'll remember this you are a great high bear (moans) the horse and buggy pulls off a few rogue cabbages and vegetables falling off the end it's all right it happens a lot yeah y'all are all right i'll talk to the high bear committee and make sure you guys don't have any heat on your tails after this i've seen enough of the world i think i'm ready for a little honey vacation as you all ride off into the sunset away from westruun trinket you're back in the flaming sun kissed tavern a bunch of guards run in vex and pike among them vex immediately sees you oh my darling bear oh no what happened she turns and looks at grog grog oh buddy here i got you those treats did you save the day did you are you a good bear oh grog and that is where we will end tonight's
