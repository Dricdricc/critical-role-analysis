i did it was a little complacent but i yay'ed i gave him one we were talking to one of the heads at 826la over the break joel and he was saying that they would love to do d&d but no one on their staff knows how to dm or do d&d so if there's an 826 in your area and you're like i know i'll start a d&d club i'm sure they'll be open to it just go talk to them and go teach kids d&d or cool eight-year-olds who are equally as amazing nerd is chic now i'll take that as a compliment why don't you just question us right now i'm confused on why you don't just do that now jails are not my favored terrain just want to point that out not this go-around no not really comfortable with that can i double back into the performance area and see if i can find that little girl that they're looking for before they do yeah i'm going to try to be aloof stealth a little bit i don't want to make myself completely known no just trying not to draw attention i ditched you that's cocked that's better 17 do i see the little girl whose name was-- what was her name are people being amicable okay i want to look around do i see any type of movement in the shadows anyone looking suspicious ooh yeah natural 18 21 so they're bringing the both of them out am i still next to that horse i'm going to take my staff and give a really nice whack to the horse to get it to run oh my god i'm so nervous right now that's not great 11 get pissed sure kick me i'm going to bolt in the opposite direction and try and loop around to the south side of the tent big dice big dice okay 19 okay can i loop around kind of come up behind them the devil toad and toya yep (yells) did you see that it leaned to a four ten that sucked laura put him in the dice jail okay it's okay toya and i look at toya hey come on let's get out of here let's go fuck you didn't say there were fucking guards i thought you said they left one of them left so wait oh shit ey i was actually just looking for the loo no i'm trying to get the girl i was trying to free the damn girl it's just the two guards right so are they taking me away what are they doing with toya anything are they leaving them behind okay i'm going to do a quick-- i'm in shackles okay i'm going to do some monk shit here i'm going to elbow one of the guards right in the ribs and take the other one and bash the other one in the face and then i'm going to turn to toya and i'm going to say run run go run trying to distract these fucking assholes that is a six ten do i at least get the run out to toya is she just standing there waiting for a guard what is she doing is she running no they can both run run for your life fine whatever she wants to get arrested at this point i go join my friends help help help help help help help help help help (laughter) (clears throat) help ah oh no you misunderstood see that was just i have this spasm that has this twitch it was an injury from like a childhood thing yeah that's actually-- (fake crying) it was very sensitive for me i had a really tough childhood i was just trying to find a bathroom yeah i'm looking injured man i show him my eight hit points of damage yeah this is just a wrong time wrong place thing i practically raised her it's a sensitive subject adopted sister sure and i'm more than willing to be compliant with the investigation in fact you can see the injury the beast left on my ribs so if you want to test it for any type of specimen samples feel free it's very painful but i'm willing to do it for the cause no it's a separate issue there was two things going on there was like the big angry toad beast and he got a swipe at me and then there were people who were getting attacked yeah yeah uh-huh nope aw shit my little sister what the what i was just trying to go with what you said all right i mean it kind of worked but you're not entirely wrong i was trying to go get the stupid little girl who seemed to be stupid i tried to save her i was like get the hint what's going on (stammers) yeah if anything we should be looking at this guy why are we putting our neck out for you can i insight check him her sam natural 20 front butt you just saw that too (laughter) just curious why you have a mask yeah bringing it back my mother always said nothing in life is free none of this absolves the dodgy goblin who slinked past that first question where are you from what are you traveling from why the mask sure you are it has nothing to do with that people who move from place to place frequently tend to have other stories as to why they're doing it well you're going back to the goblin thing i'm more curious about the travel thing i immediately check my pockets after that to see is nott has lifted anything is everything still there all my coin not great not great at all six wait that was a 15 right that was the dice i rolled 16 okay wait i'm sorry i think i need clarification if sticks mean things like valuable canes what do rocks mean to you is it the joy of taking the things or do you just like gifts do i notice anything shifty about that while we were looking at his hands 21 you have questions for me yeah i am my parents were in the winery business the wine making business and halflings really like wine that's true some halflings just deal in wine a lot and a lot did in the town that i'm from and then my parents wanted me to keep up with the books and all that stuff so it forced me to learn halfling i was around it a lot it's a bit aways it's kamordah it's a small farming town it's no big deal it's whatever nope just a wandering traveler just like the rest of y'all yeah circus woo circus coming to town just don't break anything aw buddy i've seen you have a few tricks up your sleeve you seem like you're not totally magic inept have you had your abilities your whole life like a kid something happen we got a good 24-48 hours on the rest of you nope can i request a display i think i have a broken rib it might be getting more purple i'll sleep it off it's fine does it hurt don't poke at me with a fork no you don't my bruise is in the shape of a dick that would be fun all right i'll sleep it off i'm in jester's room still i think sleeping on the floor on my bedroll you hit a button he just throws the ipad as i wake up i sit up and i go jester were you laughing to yourself last night i just kept hearing giggling it was obnoxious uh-huh i just get ready yeah i take my robes and i flip them inside out and i take some dirt and dirty it up a little bit and take my hair down and i steal a scarf off of jester's stuff and i do a bandana around my head what are you guys doing you guys leaving are you guys fucking leaving you're not leaving without me are you you're skipping town i could skip town with you though do you want to skip town i guess i go down and have breakfast as well would you do my makeup for me are you let's do that i mean look at him no offense or anything and you're so concerned with your goblin friend i mean he's in the same boat as the tieflings i said your goblin friend laura and whatever i'm working on it oh yeah yeah laura yeah and a mustache and a hat (low gravelly voice) i think i can do that i'm going to go a step further and tape down my boobs bandage them down all the way you know wrap them stuff my crotch a little bit do i have some five o'clock shadow mr woolly wait fjord how do you sound say words you're manly travis and is that your human face it's so hard so anxiety-inducing are we going out in pairs like you said (deeper) are we going out in pairs yeah 16 it's fine don't worry about it i mean you mentioned no sick people if he was sick sometimes that word gets around he was helping i punched a snake to death oh it was a giant water snake then the little girls were complaining about more and more instances of these snakes coming out of the lake yeah the lochward is that what we're talking about sure you know we should drink to old stories of brinjay brinjay is there anyone who did that wasn't hypothetical what's the book a romance novel shithead we learned a few things actually he's a prime target perfect victim perfect candidate no one really paid attention to him he was old he had no family his son's gone awfully convenient still awfully convenient that your little circus doesn't allow the elderly which you never fully explained and he happened to be one of the oldest people in that circus where did that rule come from the sick makes sense i asked you that before but why elderly do you know who implemented that rule still a good candidate or if you were trying to frame someone seems to be a lot of pretty bigoted people in this town who don't like tieflings and other strange lots jester you actually said one of the smartest things of the night which is-- you did yeah which is guard's really weird yeah the crownsguards as you were saying the ustaloch they seem to be the one connecting through-line also what's her name norda mentioned that she didn't want to let you lot in but made an exception i don't know if i wanted to do something and if i already knew a bunch of people were upset and angry at a circus and strange people coming in it's easy framing in my opinion that or if you're up to no good and you don't want to get caught blame it on the easy frame the weirdos who just rolled into town i don't know it might not be the guards there might be another through-line that we're missing ooh that's a good idea yeah maybe when they question us-- i like that aw so the ustaloch is the docks it's what they called the ward or it's the lake what does usta mean what does usta come from you speak zemnian east lake all right agreed i love how we just went through every rain song in about 30 seconds oh shit hey jester do you happen to remember the name of that guy whose daughter we saved from the snake yeah yeah because i didn't write it down damn it that's true we could go by he seems to like us that's the snake i punched well no they helped me i'm not an egomaniac they fucking helped me give credit to the whole damn group move on thanks for the damn compliment sorry for dropping in yeah it's me i pull the hat off and pull my hair up it's beauregard we killed your snake oh no don't worry about it what was your name friend rinaldo that's what it was i knew it was an r okay rinaldo you mentioned the circus coming to town as weird why how's your little girl doing sorry i cover my beard sorry i have a fang too right i'm starting to think that following enon's story isn't necessarily going to lead us here he seems like a random victim are we just going from person to person in town telling them to come find us yeah maybe we should get back so kids don't know anything about this old people don't know anything about this-- but pure of heart still going back to the guards thing back to the tavern let's go yeah how much time does she have maybe super stealthily back yeah that's a good idea fjord's distracting he's on caleb's back yeah he updates overnight as long as he's plugged in right type in your passcode if you agree to the terms did you say that because you wanted to tell me something i like that we're giving them-- authority got the upper hand okay do we invite them in or are we going to-- you open the door i'm going to sit unassuming on the bed oh oh yeah hi bullshit jury duty shit goddamn it seven dollars a day what is this shit you guys should start a band like a boy band or something i thought you enjoyed games sure okay that's not true i still say that some of the best information that you can get can be in the information that you don't find i'm just saying sometimes the lack of information can be a process of elimination it's super broad i'm trying to be fucking silver lining so i don't feel like a piece of shit for waste a day and you guys are shitting on that but it's fine see no one knew anything about him that means prime candidate someone's little experiment little frankenstein i'm telling you who are you talking to about 24 hours longer than you have ooh that's a good idea you guys notice that it's weird that no one's actually really talking about this this is a small town i come from a small town small town people gossip someone is talking about this we just haven't found them yet 200am field trip mm-hmm i like that oh is he like an asshole cat yeah we did natural remedies what was the other one jackalwere that's true how do people send messages in this town have we figured that out before we leave-- is there a window in the hall or are there only windows in our bedrooms okay that's fine on our side of the room-- on our side of the door i'm going to take out my healer's kit do i have any bandages or medical tape or anything like that i'm going to tie a bandage ever so lightly around one side of the handle onto something on to the other side of the door if there's something like a lamp or some kind of pipe or something i can tie it to correct okay yeah i'll take some string and just some twine and-- yeah well i figured we're all in the same room at this point i'm trying to make sure that if someone tries to come in our room we'll know if they come in what can you do that's better let's do that well i was going to say in the door but if there's maybe a place in the hall 19 let's not spread out too far though perception 18 to the left three in the morning i turn to caleb any tingling from your alarm system that's a good point is she under arrest we don't know maybe we should go back to the circus scene of the crime that whole thing i'm all right or if you see something how far are we from the inn a little tagger is no one staying behind or-- oh not great nine are we in like an alleyway or in the street all of us oh man it's real cold out you fixed them a bit yay what is that do you guys have like a nightlight oh sure do they still look like crownsguard okay yeah something good something good that's dope i'm sure rob liefeld just got a nosebleed and he doesn't know why not that one i don't feel good about it oh not bad 21 the cart and it's by the lake right that's pretty close to a lake it's the lake it's common i had mona and lena but maybe it's lolie was there anyone new here recently that you haven't worked with a lot what about mona and yuli why are they bitter (stutters) what happened to them no i'm trying to hear and whisper at the same time matt cone of whisper what did they say why do they think that why is the world shitty yeah listen the world has its own brand of shitty depending on whose eyes are looking at it right so what is their brand of shitty where are they molly why did you laugh when i asked about the sisters first cast travis and 13 not great right okay can i insight check the sisters what are they doing right now they're not saying anything though do they look nervous or are they just being shifty yeah 15 toad guy i would like to talk with the sisters while that is going on i go and sit down next to them putting my knees up too this whole thing is really messed up right yeah man like why would we do anything like that i feel like we're all being needlessly persecuted oh sorry i'm beau the other bo but i helped fight the zombies the other night i'm under house arrest we're under the same situation just separately not really i don't want to compare myself to you because that would be rude he's such a dick why is he such a dick oh sorry he's been talking shit about you this whole time i don't know i just-- it's okay 15 what am i trying to do i'm trying to figure out who's behind all this so that we can keep moving on with our lives your guys' performance was amazing by the way i loved it no so wait it's probably gustav what makes you say that oh wow you have interesting perspectives hey weird question how do you guys come up with your acts is that something that you guys create yourselves or do you guys workshop it you feel the same way knot sisters feel like this is karma on gustav shut up shut up insight check on the knot sisters what natural 20 [all exclaiming] give me that sweet whisper just a guard one of the guards what the fuck i run up to the guard and check his pulse is he still alive or is he paralyzed yeah but get under the tent we can get the drop exactly we can't get framed and did it look like the same figure towards ustaloch it's the fucking lake [crosstalk] see here's my thing does anyone else notice that the zombie transformations seem like a serpent shedding its skin because they always slough off their skin wait what
