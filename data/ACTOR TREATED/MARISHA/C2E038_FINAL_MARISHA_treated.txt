spooky things you know how there's always a time where the narrator stops lets your imagination run wild with what happens i just wanted to say people might have ideas and thoughts and i'm trying to look out for you because we said we'd have each other's backs sometimes the less you say the more people's minds like to fill in the blanks from what i've learned generally what's in people's heads is worse than the reality of the situation i mean look we've seen you do some weird fucked up shit right so any time you're unsure it's going to make other people even more unsure with a layer of suspicion it's like a tiramisu of confusion no pressure let's go fight some snake people i agree and i walk up no why are you following me why are you doing this how many i duck down i turn to the rest of the group and i say (whispering) snake four of them shields weapons i direct the group and i say you flank this way and then you guys flank that way we flank around (whispering) i tell them to hold we duck and watching so it's snakes versus lizards right yeah we didn't punch our way through shit oh my god i turn around and i say do we have anything that resists poison or venom caduceus you raised your hand i feel like maybe with these people we should have a frontline party and a backline party and maybe a little frontline poison resistance could be good no i don't mind going in front
