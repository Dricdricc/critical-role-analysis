kickstarter up right now called lost hope the series that i'm a part of it's like battlestar galactica meets archer and yeah i voice a character named simmons in there it's fun go check it out i like this sweater is this new oh god i got pretty wasted 19 pike and i are hiding too can i do like a nature check on this thing to see if i can discern any type of information on it just straight intelligence that's not good i think that is a five six six i'm just going to whisper to pike and be like it doesn't have any eyes i feel like we shouldn't move okay i like hold her shoulder pads so she doesn't clink any okay i'm going to stay right here i'm just i'm just going to i don't want to move i'm just going to wait i don't want to move am i able to take a bonus action to like shout something out over comms yeah everyone should try and get a little bit so i can see you and i can make us all fly i learned it today but you have to be within 30 feet of me you know imagine i said it more succinctly than this yeah hey move down a bit so you're not in my way (laughs) pukes ice here's what i want to try and do i want to try and hope to god i can get everyone in here i wanted to-- oh wait i'm trying to point the fucking-- point the laser at the screen i want to try and go-- five ten 15-- can i go through grog through there can i go there wait wait back closer to the-- i want to be able to try and-- can i see scanlan and stuff over there all right everyone i guess who's within 30 range of me i'm going to do a wind blast and we all turn into poofy cloud versions of ourselves wind walk poofy cloud so as i run past grog i brush his shoulder and he turns into a mist form and i turn into a mist form and then i blast it out and everyone's mist form oh you can't attack no we're still there man that was going to be way cooler if we could still it was a 6th-level spell thanks guys i feel so validated i did just learn it yesterday we could try and get the fuck out of here we could use this to our advantage and get the fuck away so i don't feel like i just wasted a 6th-level spell just want to say i technically do but fuck that i did learn dispel magic but-- no figure it out make it work for yourselves assholes that was a 6th-level spell god damn it yeah it's ten people we're all shit out of luck how does that feel i thought we could still attack which would be way dope if you don't move they'll go away shut up taliesin oh that's right it was sick right yeah he's really married to this one wait what no no no one-- oh no yeah you're right yeah can i not kill it at all i can't kill it question can i switch to an animal form why would you do that dex save regular dexterity save or do we get advantage because we're misty do we have advantage i don't think i made my dexterity check a two what shut up liam 16 all right 32 does that mean we could just get them fighting each other okay here's my question i know (laughter) i will say we all failed in reading it also-- nothing nothing i'm afraid now yeah what were you going to say (laughs) i like that question we all failed in reading it one minute it says one action on yours it says one minute on mine yes it does no it's different it says casting time one minute it already happened so it doesn't matter yeah it's already happened we're already committed one minute so fight club failed i mean i'm still willing to commit to it it's fine so i accelerated the casting of the spell are you giving me an out because you feel bad because if you're giving me an out-- he did read the card too and we all thought it was a good idea (laughing) for my own shame all right fine i'll drop the spell 'cause i feel really bad about it but on my way down okay here's my question because i want to make these fuckers fight each other so is there loose rock along the edge of the wall okay so as i'm dropping the spell-- as i revert back can i slide down that wall to create some-- yeah uh-huh i drop the spell and as i drop the spell i want to grab some wall and bring it down to make a big vibration right in between these two motherfuckers oh jeez louise oh that's not too bad it's not a saving throw 18 uh-huh do i have any movement oh jesus christ can i just tiptoe backwards towards percy or should i-- you know what i'm going to stay i'm just going to stay right there is that even worse of a decision i'm just going to-- up against the wall and not move i'm going to doctor grant it i hold my breath you also see me against a wall right next to you i love that song thanks for that yeah no bringing it to a total of 22 i deserved that so does it know that i'm there since it just took a big chunk out of me all right i'm in arm's length of it right i'm going to reach out and cast blight on it 18 oh jeez what was that seven seven plus five seven eight 13 16 and then another 12 where was i at 18 oh so 28 32 33 points i'm going to once again not move can i go ahead and cast healing word on

unconscious ooh good work grog hi grog it was very good yeah you did good how do you know that yeah they were trying to kill each other scanlan that's only your relationships i take out like my little filet knife and i start going to town on the frost worm in front of me trying to salvage anything that i can from him my book i got my book it's me i got my book which gives me advantage 29 can i vial any of the blood yeah i want to do that and i'm going to take that mandible if i can yeah what do you want yeah yeah we were trying to do this before we were trying to melt his face because pike was going to do a talk to dead spell well i guess we're taking the body i'll focus my heat on his feet so we can just dislodge him and throw him over our shoulder and go how much time is it going to take them to get the gold how about this let's spend five minutes doing all this stuff and see where we're at son of a bitch we should go sorry about that whole cloud mist thing you guys i was trying to-- yeah sorry about that thanks vex look it was something new i'm still working out the kinks all right i'm working out the kinks i'm sorry it'll be really cool next time i try it i'm still really confused as to why we came back here to begin with right well that's been confirmed it's not quarantine the house i'm still really confused as to why we are trying to maintain honor to inhonorable people how is this going to sound to uriel excuse me uriel just want to let you know that we broke into general krieg's old house and found out it's really dangerous can we have it well i'm just saying how do we phrase this and what happens when he asks why we were there in the first place i don't know all of your items can be purchased oh it's reverse whispering wet willie okay okay we're running out of the house christ the house just collapses since when grog but you haven't been drinking today who all is around to see this pike can you discern what kind of entity this might be attached to okay is that all you have pike that's all you can find out yeah no one touch the-- is it just laying on the floor right now no but percy to be fair you've had a bit of a weakness with you know evil entities being attached to you no it's not going to-- it's not granting anyone's wish i mean if want to sleep a day we can all just bamf back we can tree stride back to whitestone if we want to take a nap well i've already spent my one 6th-level spell turning us into fucking clouds yeah honestly if i would've turned everyone into a cloud-- who has to deal with the house what hang on grog you were-- yes exactly the portal has to be crushed why was it talking through you grog why not pike if you can ask it questions maybe we could ask it a few more questions what time is it i guess i'll go with percy and take the skull and i'll make sure we put it somewhere safe in the keep if you guys want to go talk to uriel do you want to come with us pike do you want to be with the skull pike or do you want to go talk to uriel well it sounds like they've already-- they're sending other people to get her out what's the big deal oh she's 'quite special' to you yeah why is that creepy but you were courting her two days ago i thought she spent the night in your room that's true what wait what like an aunt you tried to sleep with your baby daddy oh wow well that's-- why do you keep saying she's 'related to' you why don't you just call her exactly what she is which is your daughter that's weird to be like 'my child is related to me' who do you want to take you pick your dodgeball team so many secrets all right can i heal myself up first oh wait pike will you hook us up dope huh i'm at 65 now with that so i'm still 30 under how much 4000 i'm going to whisper to scanlan i'm going to say i'm going to stay back you go ahead that was the most privileged thing you've ever said touch√© i've got polymorph i can always be a tiny thing in your pocket sorry i'm back here i figured percy and i were waiting back here do you have gold scanlan no trips to coldstone with percy you are not the godfather about this time i come over the earpiece and i go how's it going in there guys good just let me know if you need me they were tossing your ass out i'm glad i came in handy for that field trip i liked them they were fun maybe they thought we were even yeah what the fuck what's with jarett they were good drinking buddies a 20 by six foot canvas percy and i go downstairs to make sure the skull is still there beautiful what time is it i guess so we stashed it yeah percy maybe me and you should make some reinforcements or something but we'd have to put it with someone else right once a day i know or else i would totally run it over and run it back oh if i use your thing i could what if she doesn't come i'd be using a 6th-level spell as a glorified messenger 'hey we found a scary skull' you know what scanlan why don't you figure out how to get the damn skull back to whitestone by yourself how's that nothing happened last night but it seems like a ticking time bomb i mean i could-- all right i could wall of stone another kind of box around it all right i guess we're staying in town seems okay yeah let's post someone here i guess yeah you're great don't let anyone in or out i'm just saying all right okay 29 vax vax nope rich people clapping sure raishan no
