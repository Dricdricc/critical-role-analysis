we're gods now i have my 8th-level spell yeah i do i get them all you so sneaky percy can i see your gun i inspect-- (sighs) i'm so bad at these i want to see if there's a gem or device on it like a tracking device oh shit 20 i think percy was right i think she has been spying on us wait wait wait wait i can use this if it's-- yeah i can scry through it and she was very attached to it which means it should work pretty well i've also met her so that helps percy we should go this isn't helping anything i mean all magic has a risk factor depending on-- i can hear but i don't think they can hear me it's like looking through a little window i don't know how this runic magic works on his gun this is something different than what i would be doing you're not that ugly she just meant that to hurt your feelings but you are a piece of shit was ripley a magic-user did she ever engage in magic i don't know if he's qualified to handle firearms if trinket shoots himself in the ass i have to study and then sleep on it because that's how my process works (laughter) oh my god i have that thing you gave me i have a secret what is it that i got i have a little ball-- scrying eye i have the scrying eye i have it once a day do we want to do this here i mean this is going to take me ten minutes this is going to take me a second you guys figure it out i'm going to start scrying oh fuck do we want to have the gun for this actually yeah i'll do that i'm going to go in the other room grab the gun and scry does anything help sure whatever can i use both oh i don't know what do you think would be better her notes or okay i'm going to use her notes my spell save dc is 19 oh no bitch she is a-- i grab the gun-- you are a piece of shit i'm sorry i'm still a little fuzzy when i come out of it she's going after the other one she's in the middle of the fucking ocean and she had the cloak she's with a crew in the middle of the ocean so-- i can't get us there there's no trees in the middle of the ocean scanlan can you get us there i mean i can mist us we could mist there but it would take no it's not even an island of grass it's an island of glass yeah which doesn't sound promising to be totally honest so we might have to mist there wait the water ashari are in the ozmit do i know if they would be close by this island of glass why is it always intelligence oh my god i rolled a natural one we don't communicate i mean we could let her do the hard work for us the staff is in the plane of the abyss can i also ask another question percy why does she want these vestiges in the first place i have a feeling she doesn't want to fight dragons do you know why would you say that exactly because we've met a lot of terrible people their dad saundor was pretty shitty clarota we had to fly across the ozmit sea to get to marquet gilmore made for us but the ocean's above us right i mean i could teleport us-- i could teleport us to the edge of the continent we could sleep and then misty step lasts eight hours wind walk whatever wind walk lasts eight hours it could take us a while to even get the airship we can't tilt the camera up a little bit yes i can she's in the middle of the ocean yeah we have no idea what it actually is let's go get it he's going to take one really close look at that gun and see a lot of whitestone in it even if they did see her we know she knows how to alter her appearance also no offense percy but i feel like we need to be careful on who you expose that gun to from here on out not only one for people who might think you're the culprit but two for people who are going to want to rip you off again maybe she'll die in the ozmit sea is it like a flying from east to west thing where we gain back a day when we go back and we didn't get the vestige we came here for so-- wait what don't we need it to tap the gun to-- we hadn't heard anything in these past few days we decided to pay her a call in her hideout clearly we know how this looks which is why we came to you first and what are the people around us doing are they like drawing their weapons do they seem armed i want to just glance not bad straight perception 25 i look down in front of me is there any hidden cubbies in the table that we are at yeah no what did they look like how was she a full week ahead of us i'm sure you have a cleric in the circle talk to her firsthand if you have to killed her we didn't come to you because we necessarily needed to go through the proper channels we did it because we were trying to be forthcoming clearly you are all a talented bunch so are we i mean we don't have any use for it or you know even if you know of any trees big trees port town of shamal the port of shamal why don't we call them in and have them look at it are there not that many pilots in the world wyverns attacked us i'm not there at all company card man what's the card game --or a six aww i slam some mead in front of him oh i've been practicing that actually i can be really heavy yeah it's not very often we see you shaky percy hang on wait hang on i was about to ask if you ever have regrets of building something awful and releasing it into this world and now you just said you're going to double down essentially what exactly are you thinking of making just because we could destroy your notes i mean you're still alive and your guns still got into the world you're arguably one of the greatest minds in existence right now percival but you are and vex isn't wrong percy you know you can talk to us right you never share ideas with us all right well you shouldn't feel regret about not taking another person's life it's a moment of humanity did you not want to kill her because in a way you feel responsible for who she is also i know you're really smart but we're smart too don't insult our intelligence by assuming we can't comprehend one of your ideas percy percy i have we've been through so much i want more mead i love you but i hate you but i love you did you tell him we were the ones with the wyverns because that's what i would have told him had i been there theoretically really okay that's true son of a bitch guys this could be a gift think of the possibilities can i check it scanlan help me check this what do we do here scanlan help oh boy 16 okay i'll look at it again what does it look like what do you mean it looks the same and we didn't say your name i was imagining the creep music video from lonely island true the gun was in the other room sure big money no whammies no i make sure scanlan goes first i want to take percy to the front of the ship set it down and i want to-- (whispers) say you can fly say you can fly say you're flying (laughs) damn it we wanted her right are we cool what's her name did we ever get a name from her yeah ideally she does the hard work for us you seem very familiar with this place do you have more information i could do that can i do a nature check to see if that sounds familiar beasts or something that would happen-- heat a lot of fucking heat 26 that's what my thought was would a dragon's breath what about if a bunch of sorcerers and magic users got together and made a big nuke keyteor how long ago was it i could theoretically do three scrys tomorrow i could theoretically do five scrys tomorrow she knows where we're going so she'll let us know if we get there i describe the ship to them from what i've seen how many hours has it been yeah morning scry yeah morning constitutional here we come bust out whatever magazines they have nearby cup of coffee first yeah crystal first it doesn't say docked like anchors down she's found it she's there she doesn't have it but she's found the ship she's right off the shore of the island she's under the water i mean i could they all took water breathing potions her plus five other people i saw the island it was dark in landscape i heard ripley say we have eight hours i'll take water breathing as a spell is it concentration what ten willing i got us on lock you guys i can get us closer straight through fastest route captain i go ahead and i start casting my first 8th-level spell which is control weather it's everything i've ever wanted you guys i make it temperate with a nice warm breeze can i do that make the winds in our favor i'm drunk on power i go into a deep meditation this is some buddhist shit going on for me right now it's been six hours you said since i did my scry they have one hour left if we have one hour left they could fail they could not find it at all i mean all of these things are very appealing to me right now i'm just trying to understand why she also has the cloak we want what do we know about magical items do they get destroyed by things like fire or me being a meteor then yes i'm down to fuck this shit up he can fly it's not a concentration spell right water breathing well do we want to drop your ass off on the shore this is my favorite plan we've come up with in a long time does this look like the right boat dispel oh yeah what's our eta captain i'll wait ten minutes because i like to milk my time yeah i look through the telescope does it look like the same boat i rolled an 18 so 29 okay so am i scrying it takes me 30 seconds to scry once i get there i'm going to scry i'm going to cast water breathing and then i'm going to scry taliesin wait can you do me a favor okay so i go to everybody and i say you have water breathing you have water breathing and everyone has water breathing then i go everyone leave me alone for ten minutes i drop down and i scry okay 13 son of a bitch i grab vax for safety percy i can destroy that ship if we get over it i go with vax i'm holding on to him piggyback ride style i got to get over the ship i can't fly as an earth elemental i wait until he gets me over top of the boat as soon as he gets me over top nice and high nice and high i let go we're over the boat wait what natural 20 i blow vax a kiss and then i go earth elemental i light up my flaming hands and then i go keyteor 6d6 there's got to be one more for this don't fuck me well all of them 21 plus one oh wait 22 plus do i roll my flame hands 27 i get up and i say sorry i tell the guys above swim to shore i crush everything me natural 20 there's no reason that should have happened yeah i guess i start toward the beach well that's going to take a long time the ship is sinking right i'm going to drop my form okay i take all the papers and i shove them in a pocket and i'm going to cast control water i'm going to shoot myself up and out so we've all convened on the shore at this point yeah i'm meeting up with them on the shore i guess but there was so much more to do
