oh is the visual still on matt aww damn it yes you got a trinket oh my god shut up that's so cool yes it's going to be the magic carpet of a different color also i had one of the first run of these critical role shirts returned to me i'm not sure who someone from canada so if you could e-mail me and give me your right address i'm not sure who it was but i had one returned kit's awesome yes 826la is an after-school tutoring program and they feature in creative writing and storytelling and they have a young authors' program which is super amazing and they also tend to have really cool storefronts there's one here locally in los angeles one in echo park and one in mar vista but there tend to be 826s in major cities all across the country so you should check it out and go to their storefronts and tutor the kids and get involved they're a really good program we all got things ooh seekwet pwesent woo he's stuck on the 5 underdark (michael jackson voice) that's ignorant (laughter) that's cool yeah put him to sleep oh he's got to have a-- i've got access to this thing let me show you yeah some jethro tull up in here are we there yet is he still grappled come on yeah if we can keep him controlled i can get him mind-controlled on our team for 30 days he's going to be like that one scene in lord of the rings you speak giant he's so cuddly i don't want to see the giant fist of scanlan capture oh do we have more i've got one right here throw it to that table whose turn is next can i go next and help him out are we still trying to capture him okay i'm going to-- can i move can i get to him if i turn into a snake can i get down there big snake (laughter) i want to turn into a giant constrictor real big snake yeah i'm going to constrict him i'm a naga i'm so pretty and i'm going to start constricting i get a plus six oh wait it's a strength-- -- bonus i guess so 14 i thought we were trying to capture him go to sleep or can we figure out a way to restrain him because here's the thing i have an ability where i can use geas and cast geas on him and i basically give him a command and he'll essentially become our big-- he'll be our big beefy minion for 30 days and if he resists it he takes psychic damage no you had a snack not that long ago can i take time if we grapple him and i take a rest essentially almost take a 20 to cast geas on him generally takes a minute to cast can i do that i guess you can help me out i'm going for it he has to succeed on a wisdom saving throw against me oh yeah what it's wisdom oh against my spell save 18 it's like a political rally follow our orders help us fight k'varn vex how do you say follow our orders in underdark (gibberish) how do i say 'kill' i look at him and i go (retching noise) k'varn shut up percy i'm not from here clearly (retching noise) k'varn follow our orders you roll with us you our posse now i don't think he can understand you there's a translation barrier going on i already told him that he's in our posse well you here for now you we roll together i'm trying to say we roll deep i take that as a good nod it keeps up for 30 days what should we call him tiny he's a fomorian what are we checking ooh the fromorians well the fromorians-- for-morians foh-morians foh-moh-ree-ans an 18 plus ten so 28 fomo yeah well i mean it sort of has to it starts to fry his brain if he doesn't we might be able to box him up or maybe we should chain him up while we sleep or something i don't know i mean he should be okay well hang on what are we doing from here because it's going to dictate what i pick but we can send the giant beating on the front temple door no it was already open remember no it's open some sort of glass yeah okay here's my thing why do we need to do reconnaissance we already know what we need to do well i mean i could do some heat metal and weaken it the elder brain casing was not necessarily the cross don't google it i can possibly-- i'll make sure i learn heat metal and i can heat the edges of the crossbeam and then if we can have grog bring something heavy after we've weakened it hot metal bends can you levitate or do something to move a giant boulder that we can drop on top of it well according to clarota it was pretty heavily-- you mentioned that the elder brain was pretty protected from physical damage that there was lots of magical enchantments and stuff oh you mean-- what if instead of letting it fall before we fully break it we take the rope and rope it and chain and then lift it and then take it away taliesin and it looks like a beehive go have a look why you're just going to get caught i'm just wondering what more you're going to find out from a flyby that i couldn't find out from my vision oh no oh god can i do something i go ahead and cast enhance ability for dexterity on scanlan over here new carpet it's advantage you get to roll twice i like it it probably would be a contest of wills well what if we-- how about this why don't we turn him into a mouse and we can just keep him as our you know emergency pocket mouse and whenever if we need a quick distraction then we flick him in his mouse nuts and drop him over and-- after we've destroyed the mechanism yeah that's why i was saying if we can-- i think if we tie a chain to it i think we break the beams and then air-evac it out personally well then how about this why don't we concentrate instead of-- because okay it's a middle cross beam thing right why don't instead of focusing on the middle section we focus just on two sides so it goes i can talk to the bats or i can dominate a bat i could talk to the bats i'll make sure i can talk to the bats no i mean i could fog cloud us we could look like a big floating cloud well here's the thing are we trying to actually-- we're not trying to get inside the temple could you fashion-- well i'm flying people overtop i'm assuming i think we should all be on top together i don't think we should try and separate a sparrow aw i'm trying to figure out a way we could just conserve the acid like if i could-- okay yeah okay try it gingerly are we going to fight him now or are we going to try and run are we going to try and lure our way-- we could still take a similar approach and just have-- we've already decided we're going to have two teams to be on two separate ends to do the slidey-- the hingey maneuver and then have a third team that's k'varn distraction duty right so if-- so we've got this pyramid and there's this cross beam you said right matt and there's this top of it which is open so this is the pyramid you can see and then the thing is if you can see through it the thing is hanging down and it looks it's all spirally and then here is-- the elder brain somewhere in here so if we go for-- drop in if we have to and yeah so okay okay hang on what happens if this starts going poorly or if you're dead should we have a safe location grog what are you thinking over there it worked for the spartans in that awesome 300 comic shut up it was awesome in the comic it's got a massive cross beam supporting a giant arch structure yeah i mean grog if it gets to a point where we want to go in i will go in underneath with you i'll do my earth elemental thing i'll go with you if it gets to that point well right now you are going to be mouse and then-- wait for me to finish my thought stay with me and then you fight k'varn you kill beholder eat food yes delicacy i'll be on the carpet no we're all magic carpeting can we-- here's the thing if i turn into a hawk i won't be able to turn into an earth elemental the stealthiest stealth people first someone's burning a spell or we're going in shifts one of the two so we're picking one rather polymorphing trinket-- or we're casting fly on him what if we cast fly on the bear can you cast fly on trinket and then have grog ride trinket is that the same problem so we can all fly who else can go is there room for one more no i stay behind yeah people were dropping people off awesome can i go ahead and cast pass without a trace on the rest of us it's so cute 34 i turn and i seeing the bats come in in bat language in like you know echo (bat noises) echolocation i tell the bats don't worry about it go home we're running an errand for k'varn don't worry about it oh but i had a good roll but i had a good roll i cast speak with animals that's what i cast it was a spell no i said i do this i cast speak with animals 18 it's really distracting i hope so does he get double pass without a trace well do you want to work on one beam and i can maybe do a focused soldering on the other okay okay i'll take one side and grog's going to take the other beam i'm going to start-- i'm going to take my staff and i do a concentrated heat metal spell and i'm just going to kind of solder right along the inside where it's already weakened right well then why don't i'll heat the metal while grog is prying it to help he's using like a crowbar right well we'll tag team it then yeah but we want to save him let's see if we can do this first well we can have tiberius hit him with like a quick damaging spell and make him-- well why don't we weaken the beams first what do you mean well it's good-- jig's going to be up as soon as a giant-- but what if it doesn't bust all the way through until we start popping some of the beams it's a three-inch-thick piece of pane and steel should i go ahead and heat the metal just in case for added stuff i mean that's quiet why would you say that we weakened only one side so hopefully it'll only smash one side maybe we can even try and aim him leaning towards our side more i start heating the metal beams concentrating from both sides i am gonna go ahead and cast stoneskin on myself i cast stoneskin on myself oh is he dead maybe we should just go what'd he say i left the door open for you are we leaving nine come on pike oh it's me this may-- okay how big of a jump is it from me to k'varn (laughs) i'm gonna do it fuck it yolo i'm going to run off the carpet and i'm going to do a swan dive and-- i'm on the edge of the platform-- running and i'm going to swan dive and as i swan dive-- okay 15 and as i get closer mid-swan dive i'm gonna turn into my earth elemental and grab him and take him down with me with the earth elemental's strength oh i don't have this book it's in the monster manual we didn't print this out yet i rolled a 19 and right before i swan dive i go-- i yelled-- or before i transformed i yell to the party go get away let me be heroic i've got-- holding onto his eye stalks and i'm riding him i've got him no you can-- don't feel like you shouldn't hit things because of me i've got 126 hit points as an earth elemental and they don't affect my hit points once i hit zero i go back to whatever hit points i had i can act like a tank which is what i'm doing go for it i'm also immune to a lot of shit i would appreciate that also pike too right didn't she have an advantage thing no grog oh stop being so pouty you knew this was coming you're-- yeah totally i don't know what i did but you're welcome what was this one sorry i was shell-shocked okay 15 damn it wait do i have advantage for that still do i still have advantage for that okay do you crit on 18 grog fastball special want me to toss your ass up there see if you can grapple on to him i can try yeah all right i'm going to cheerleader-toss grog so i want to take grog and push him up to see if he can essentially do what i did to k'varn i would have to hold my turn 'cause i can't reach him right i probably can't jump to reach him either i'll hold my turn then i'll hold my turn 'til grog's is that temporary hit points okay yeah oh i'm getting a donut hang on okay taliesin and fastball special so gymnast hyup adds strength check 15 but i'm also a giant earth elemental pretty freaking huge horn horn horn like a bolo hold on it's going to fly up can i move underneath so i can maybe catch grog from where i cheerleader-- prep prep for the basket because i imagine it was like a cheerleader can someone handle the fucking meatball come on percy (grunting affirmatively) my turn is it my turn sure i'll go ahead-- since she's a tiny dwarf i'll-- what's that just a strength check as an elemental i guess 23 it's like ren faire anything that has a name like chain of something chain of dope oh i hope it was a disintegration ray one vox machina the horn was from orcus he's not a demigod yes what is the situation i'm sorry what was that what was that what was that situation with the-- the hanging you know metropolitan museum of art piece can i as a rock monster go up to it and grab it it's very heavy i was going to try and bring it down on top of k'varn i'm then just going to run and just do a double strike well you know what i'm going to run in and just grapple him i'm going to grapple him again nine oh i do mr pack away your dice why not-- i can just rip it off i'm a rock dude yes we do oh please pooper face you were so poopy the entire end of that game why what are you-- what are we in for i'm with vex yeah your head shots fucking mvp man well we've got to get the hell out of here now would you stop that you're kind of pinky yeah over i'm sweating we didn't tpk that was great those song parodies wait say that again well zac was talking over you we'll probably be there wait is she serious aww best response ever misplaced connections 826 chicago that's so cool yeah the dm says we're doing it well
