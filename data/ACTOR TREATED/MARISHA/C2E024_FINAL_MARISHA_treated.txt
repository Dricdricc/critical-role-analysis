give me your packs oh you piece of shit hey don't ever apologize for who you are man you can't help that shit first off you can't predict when people are going to be shitty that's pretty-- that's a good point when yeah he's a good guy and you think you do that's true hupperdook the job that i had before i met up with you guys in zadash information passes through you hear things i worked at a library the cobalt soul library it is a faction of monks no i hope not i think it differs from day to day depending on what i'm doing do you think i'm a bad guy that's all that matters right that has to do with the job that i had before the job that i had yeah yeah there's definitely something missing right let's catch up with the others while we walk and talk my dad was super protective and i was an asshole and rebelled a lot yeah you know so when interesting and different people would pass through my hometown i started making some connections started getting involved in some mainly illegal trading i got in really big trouble from my parents because i started syphoning his cases of wine and selling them underground for half the cost without tariffs yes i was yeah on top of other things that was like my big denouement you know i don't know i just grew to hate the town that i was in and the system that my father was a part of and so everything-- he wasn't a bad person i think he just had bad direction i don't know he could've been a good dad he was a shitty dad and a good businessman yeah yeah kind of one day he found out about what i was doing after i'd already gotten in trouble for you know a little bit of mild extortion and a little bit of trading little bit of trafficking so i think he was already pretty irritated with me then he found out about my smuggling scheme with his wine one day he called me down into the living room and there was a whole group of monks and people in black i tried to fight them off and they grabbed me and they drug me away my dad paid to get me abducted by monks yeah he wasn't very proud sure great yeah i mean there were elements that were hard but everyone has had hardships right what's it matter besides he sent me off to the monks i think he was hoping that they were going to beat my indiscretions out of me instead i think all of the things that my father saw in me that he hated the monks saw as a potential advantage so in a weird way i think it might've been the nicest thing he ever did for me i mean i still never really want to see him again and i don't think he wants to see me again either in fact he told that he didn't want to see me again so it's good yeah but i do have a nice little wineskin that i keep reserved of my family's wine if you want to taste i toss nott the wine anybody else wants a sip of my heritage scones are hard to make happy father's day you guys know that dancing is about spontaneity and you are planning this dance like when this is going to happen so hard let your heart go sure i
