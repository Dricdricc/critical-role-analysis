oh my gosh guys episodes 11 through 21 21 20 yeah 11 to 20 are out right now the other next batch of 10 should be out in a couple of weeks or so but you can find that on itunes and google play (gasps) brian foster pdt (laugh) oh yeah mischa you guys can send in chris to adjust it it's okay they know we're a show with a sound guy there's no real illusion sound guy chris vasselheim's most wanted no i wanted two cheeseburgers what did you say do we need a short rest it's in the bag of holding right it would be good for microdermabrasion i walk over to pike and put my feet in the water with her stand on the edge well you had such good observation skills with the whole ever-present light thing man you're always a surprise and after so many years i look at pike i say pike this place is beautiful it's incredible and i don't think we would be here if it wasn't for you and your connection to sarenrae and i'm honored to be here with all of you all and to see this place with vax this makes me happy just this moment this is nice (sighs) i love you all and i use my inspiring leader feat (laughter) i'm so proud he's as cold as his skin is right now i was about to say i don't leave vax's side didn't we go through something like this before so is it like a side-scrolling background is the terrain repeating itself what was your theory i start walking the opposite direction away from the tower with my eyes open i turn around is the tower any closer is it further shit i walk back i walked the other way and it definitely didn't work what do we do they're believers do i have to believe deeper than that but percy you don't believe in anything this is bullshit yeah yeah but that comes from pike not from sarenrae okay i try really hard think about the marshmallowy goodness that is sarenrae okay we have to walk though right i'm still thinking about marshmallows though he is something of a demigod now you could say and well on his path to ascension he wants to be like you or i guess he wants to be like the raven queen he could tell you more but i know she was a mortal who rose to her godhood and i know he's looking for a similar path we've seen it he's slowly staked out on the prime material plane just north of vasselheim about 350 miles what does that mean how can we stop him how long do these seeding rituals usually take how much time do we have i'm so confused that's it we didn't walk away from him unscathed the first time and we're just supposed to try again is sarenrae gone what are titties what do titties (laughs) that you've been trying to crush is he as warm and welcoming and nice as you are okay that's a good answer is there the same ever-light sky ever-present sorry ever-presence in light i use my druidic die 29 sorry 31 sure oh hey guys pelor's not messing around you know i feel a little bit more connected here this i can-- it's trees i'm surrounded by trees this i can relate to i've talked to the sun tree (gasps) i wonder if the sun tree is here maybe he's got a twin here like you have a twin decent for a city boy souls also don't wash up on beaches but apparently they do at least he knows the dangers of monocultures this is very impressive (gasps) grog don't say that he'll do it you know that's what happens yes i'm a soul blue like your feather i have a feeling it's an offering are we getting closer percy how do you feel about gods these days last time we talked we were both not optimistic i feel like reverence but a lot of things can squish us like bugs i don't know this is complicated let's just keep going i'm going to keep an eye out while we're walking for anything that resembles the sun tree i wonder if we believe harder if we'll get there quicker see this tree can squash me like a bug if it fell on me yeah does this feel like sunlight does it register like sunlight or is it a whiter light yeah is it sunlight temperature he does have a twin how close are we to the column of light i druidcraft a little twig and hold it into the light column nothing i'm going to touch it okay we're not going to die no maybe the light will take us there straight to him i jump in i touch a few as i walk by see if i feel anything should i laura and i don't know maybe he's like a distant relative of the sun tree maybe i know him by proxy i'll try and speak to one of the sun trees that looks the most friendly that's a natural one i don't know amiable amicable amiable all right i'll talk to a tree that's what i'm going to do hey sun tree bro are you a sun tree bro are you a sun tree brother what's your name no i didn't know if you knew the sun tree that grew in whitestone on the prime material plane i didn't know if you knew him can you tell me a little about this plane how do we talk to pelor how do we see him okay yeah wow i have a friend who wants to know about the fruit he's wondering if the fruit is souls if he can eat the fruit no i'm sorry i didn't mean to offend you would you like a hug okay well it was wonderful meeting you absolutely thank you all right bye okay bye you were waiting the whole time to use that weren't you the whole conversation yeah it was fine just can't talk to everybody i guess it's fine nothing just asked if he knew the sun tree and he got super offended you know what let's just go no i have never been rejected by a tree most trees like me people don't like me but at least trees do except for this asshole my leaves are prickly that's nice vex thanks you didn't talk to this guy okay you don't know yeah he said it's fruit it's fine you can eat it too you're right grog you were right eat the fruit let's go come on i rip off an apple as i go and i start aggressively eating it i fucking spike an apple that i had earlier no i just want to go in the tower are they devas celestials angels fruit wait really maybe you would have gotten smarter maybe it's super fruit maybe it's acai berries i beg to differ go to the courtyard club's over here guys this must be the bright light that everyone sees when they die you guys he knows our name we are here to prevent the coming of a third calamity he seeks ascension into godhood we don't know how to destroy vecna and assistance it's not the only one in existence there are others right what if we can-- we know you and her helped seal away the chaos of these secrets before we may need your help doing it again i could be your champion you could teach me to believe i arguably am faithless i know you all know that i believe and i have respect and i am awe-inspired by all of this but faith i still don't know if i have but i i believe you could teach me what we already have one champion of the raven queen why not i'm friends with the sun tree we talk occasionally you are the lady of whitestone it suits you i hate timed challenges are people clustered up together by now are people super clustered or is she now clustered with them so the angel dudes are all clustered together throw up a big level five flaming sphere ah wait can i do a with my spear can i do a higher-level fireball and just do more charges out of it or no then i will do a 5th-level flaming sphere it doesn't hit both of them i told you that i was faithless which might be true when it comes to the gods but not with vex'ahlia not with vox machina she gives me my power wow you're a walking nuke also a natural 20
