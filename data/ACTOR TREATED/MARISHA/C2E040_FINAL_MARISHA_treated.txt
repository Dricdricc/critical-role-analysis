the lantern like a phoenix amber eyes for the second what about the third i'll go over and look at the far mural the quinoa i walk up behind her and i go huh yeah yeah i don't actually push her in but i just want to freak her out eh salt water maybe it's not all here maybe it's in another location maybe there are two other temples i stand with jester at the edge of the pool looking down what the hell happened all right let's go right hang on i do what oh wait can you open it okay let's go come on yeah yeah i can do that let's go sure give me a boost the cheerleader hoist jesus christ 12 on my acrobatics it's really slippy 20 jester-- good times everyone hates the underwater levels didn't we have some water breathing potions somewhere okay yeah we're definitely underwater do we see the entrance or exit ahead of us so if we just book it we'll go-- we're just going to have these guys-- well i'm a human with no magical abilities so i'm going to run i can't do a whole lot (pitiful noise of a throwing star flying uselessly through water) uh huh i'm swimming up i'm going to spend a ki point to do step of the wind you have five total okay what do i see where am i quick look around the water's still filling i'm going to keep moving upwards and while i'm doing that i want to take out the 50-foot rope we have then i want to grab something heavy that i have i've got to have something stupid and heavy that i don't care about and i want to tie it to the other end a crowbar i take the crowbar and then tie it and i drop it down the well with the rope uh-huh i want to take the rope and double-grab it around me and keep hauling ass up the stairs fuck it's locked is there a key where's the key jester has the key go jester go jester go he selfishly wants the door unlocked-- take one last deep breath going to drop down and going to use that-- nope the rope is attached to me going to drop down and see if i can go for jester yeah can i take her and yank her up with me sure my last ki point that helps whatever i can do i guess no you were below me i think that's good that's nice of them (groaning) oh god take cad take cad i'm good it ends with the mob of angry people who want to kill us probably but i don't know if you're making death saves is he stable how the fuck do we get out of this haul ass 24 turtle it's only a turtle natural 20 might as well go with the flow keep moving run six rounds is there anyone tracking us pretty closely yet i'm going to take the rest of my ball bearings and dump them out as we run nott do you have anything you want to offer i don't know if any of my ideas are good i've got an oil flask i could drop down some fire but don't think it would work well either i go fluffernutter and take my ninja star and go (floof) i don't have fire i use my fists i could have used the bottle rockets (shouting) i think these are magic throwing stars i think i bought magic throwing stars what oh jeez 11 i have these bottle rockets if you can mage hand them away and distract them away from us with another popping sound well i can light them you throw and you take it further okay we'll call it-- well gee when you put it like that i don't know i feel deeply shamed by my suggestion now i know you just don't have a lot you've used all those things okay okay okay okay 20 total i want to-- we're all clear at the rowboat how close are they yeah i'm on the edge doing polearm duty like croc hunting (grunting) yeah not feeling that whole time i've never felt more useless curse you yeah yeah do we just collapse-- of exhaustion as soon as we hit the deck oh cool yeah it got uncomfortable-- you have clothes underneath your-- fiber little hearts sorry i thought that was hypothetical and that we were-- talk about that later which we should do i'll be right back you guys find a spot i'll meet you there i go back and i go jeremiah give me that i take bread or whatever he has prepared yep jeremiah hi beau what do you have right now something ready i want to chew on something while we talk thank you you have sausage to go with that water wine thank you sorry i'm just hungry as fuck i go back to the group i got appetizers there you go what the fuck actually happened down there we haven't really gotten a clear description and we're all confused yeah we saw them it connected to the pillars and then that's when everything started flooding then it was just running for our lives at that point i don't know i didn't see much else there's also the temple where we found this thing that had the snake the naga what was the one that was inside of you is it the onyx one it was the amber one oh shit is it the same color so in the amber it was the giant serpent with the tidal wave so three murals three creatures-- beings three chosen ones and three different eyes in each do i remember anything from hitting the books in school of some gods it would be history and not religion well they're the same for me same modifier 17 her-story big kaijus-kind of thing i say all of that i read this one paragraph once and then the filigree there was a monk with a trumpet up his ass and that's why i remembered this section so well in fact still remember the book bet if we go back to the library we could still find it and we could figure out more about this speaking of choice what's yours it feels like she has bigger plans the divergence yeah i've actually had a good time i've died a few times but i'm great she also seems very interested in you and don't get me wrong she's hot and all but i question her motives feels like she's-- i don't know i agree with that and i think she's understood that her sexuality can be wielded as a weapon oh that's fucking brutal i don't think there's anything wrong with maybe asking for the mist i think maybe caduceus has a good point if we can convince her that we're still part of her crew by doing our own recon we took all that time to learn how to sail the damn thing mm-hmm hee that's awesome speaking of trouble are you going to take her up on that glass of wine that she has mentioned three times (whispering) fuck make a constitution check eyy aw no what cheers d8 for me as well it's a d8 plus your constitution yeah wow that's a one do we still reroll ones that's a two thanks i rolled a two--
