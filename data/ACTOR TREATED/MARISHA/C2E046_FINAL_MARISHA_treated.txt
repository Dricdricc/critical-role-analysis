have you been on youtube since 2007 that is a company laptop pointing that out (singing) critical role [water bubbling] [thunder] [explosion] (chanting) role critical role [dramatic critical role theme] who brought a fucking parrot damn it jester perfect timing you are a bit handsy sometimes i mean it's hard because i do pretty reckless things i don't know i honestly feel like everyone feels terrible about how that went but you know when you look at on the whole we did okay i believe her actually yeah honestly man when you did that you were totally alone and by yourself it took us a minute to figure out what exactly had happened and what you touched jester i hope you know my intention wasn't to abandon anybody especially not you i thought i was going to have to activate the damn sphere and it was going to open up a portal or something i didn't know it was going to immediately take me away from the fight i'm sorry i mean i might have a part in it i think that's true i agree with that that's a good point what do we want yeah get off this godforsaken boat for a damn minute okay do i show them how am i first mate-y enough you're talking about bisaft wait the xhorhasians snuck under the mountains and attacked felderwin i frantically search for a bill that i probably don't have i look at the dockmaster i go give me the bill you're taking care of all of it did we have any-- his grog is showing was there any money left on the ship from avantika so all the money we have is pretty much the money we have fjord we might want to consider having a communal ship fund we'll talk about it later breakfast caduceus come on you're a foodie yeah how much is a bottle i think he wanted to try some mead i wanted to try some mead and then we wanted to buy some mead mm-hmm beau benth-- can i call you ben bentha pleasure could you get it i took 30 if you want to take the other five nothing just one you found us again this is the sixth time you just know where we are i know but she was just-- we're in a restaurant this is precisely why we didn't wake you up right yeah i pour her a very large glass of mead (laughter) we were going to go on a winery tour fjord what was that naval officer-- sorry what was-- what did that naval officer say to you about the war what was i hearing does that freak anybody else out sam and it's not far from my hometown either from kamordah (rustling noises) yeah but he said that they were traveling under the mountains and kamordah is a mountain town so they got under the mountains and attacked felderwin i think we should still go to the temple though well i'm just being paranoid so we find the temple and then what i guess go back to nicodranas first yeah yeah we-- yeah i'd be mad at us too oh yasha it's the next sedan coming out he decided to take some personal time to himself oh a tuesday she holds up a handful of shreds just fucked up i'm getting poor you guys i'm getting d&d poor do you not have bees in xhorhas oh yeah right she's been collecting all those flowers do they have mushrooms 30 gold feels like a lot right now just saying (flashback riff) each one is a fireball fucking score i go over to caduceus and i pull him aside really quick hey cad i have a thought as you may have heard i have now become first mate no really no one told you sure i probably have with that responsibility i started thinking about the crew and maybe we haven't been treating them the best that we could be you know i think they're okay i don't think that we're abusing them but maybe neglecting them anyway i got this extra bottle of mead for them and i thought maybe with some of the stuff we got maybe we could do a nice dinner for them or something to just show our appreciation i really don't want to get stabbed in the middle of the night is what i'm thinking so it's a little bit still selfish but really don't want to die by one of these fuckers oh a card i didn't think-- you think they'd appreciate that i could write that down yeah good call thanks i feel like a first mate should be astute it does you used it pretty correctly i think deductive reasoning you've got it nailed it man yeah good work okay i'm going to go now i start prepping the boat he did i was waiting for your response i pay attention damn could you be more ominous orly were you trying i think he was trying that was good i think that was pretty good yeah i was almost like captain o captain my captain do you need me to stay up captain before i go to bed i would like to talk to jester unless jester is having some alone time and it doesn't seem like it's the right time oh you're here keeping watch that's a good call actually going to stay up much longer yeah motion sick it's a little spooky right it's fun though listen i wanted to talk to you for a moment i'm not really good at this sort of thing but about what you said last night about being a good liar you're right you really are a good liar yeah i think it takes one to know one i think being a liar means when i know you're not does that make sense and when you are look we all get sad i want you to know that i haven't told you really any of this but i also had a lonely childhood yeah i didn't have a lot of friends my father was very protective because of certain things that he believed so i wasn't allowed to have a lot of friends really any friends maybe maybe i would have turned out a little bit more like you i admire that in you in my loneliness i got angry and turned to bad things but in your loneliness you turned to creativity i think that's beautiful i really do okay really i don't think i've ever seen you angry i'd like to see it someday i'll be proud of that too anyway i know you like to look for friends i don't know if i'm best friend material that might be a lot of commitment especially with my commitment of being first mate it really is but you don't have to look far for a friend anyway i'll leave you to it i hug her back from behind love you jes don't stay up too late i head to rest he gave me permission to (singing) celebrate sentinel bitches no we just got that repaired taliesin and merry christmas 'sup what okay (laughing) the cadence family (sharply inhales) yeah i was awake the whole night the one we're heading in fjord which is the only way we could be heading towards our destiny (laughter) orly which way are we heading towards the islands thank you so we just painted it-- to be fair he's eaten some balls-- you busted a ball that's true i'm telling you it's a ball-themed year sorry you are searching for this based on a vision fjord there are presumably three spheres yeah right you have one you have two and then avantika i'm checking if you think that this could unleash uk'otoa okay what if theoretically playing devil's advocate here maybe uk'otoa was like i should make four one extra just in case-ies vandran has that one but he's also already put it in the temple and this third one could unleash him maybe it only takes three it's you am i doing this i'll aid you are we in the middle yet no carvings in caves holes in the stone walls did you go underwater in your vision sorry go frumpkin go he made it worse the water here is pretty clear why does this keep happening we just woke up jagged tower seem familiar okay me and caduceus again want to do separate rolls this time fucking horrible eight they were like (menacing noises) do you have the ability to let us breathe under there it's cold already (groaning) (yelling) that was for the crew what nott your flask is bottomless do we see her go and sneak the mead if uk'otoa decides to show up-- what's the plan (doubtfully) okay still cool all right seals dive 12 super middle of the road is it as dark as it was before equally that's some cthulhuian shit quietly quick and fast the people are they for sure going to attack us bad super bad there are five like seahorses i will not go with yasha because sentinel and sentinel okay next target maybe natural one yeah five total for me dude what you rolled a two well that makes sense oh shit anyone in range oh yeah i'll swim-- which one is closest all of them all four of them i'll take that one i'll swim i will spend a ki point to do swim of the wind punch jesus christ right thank you jester ooh that's much better 18 i'll use my fist it was a three plus seven so ten second attack almost a natural 20 but it wasn't 13 oh that's fun fuck balls shit cock still hits five damage yep we're rolling like garbage you can call me yasha i'll take it miss second one hits ac 19 it has a prehensile penis sorry miss the one in front of me is dead i head to the next one how far away yasha's fine i'll hit the one in front of me first attack with disadvantage hits that's a natural 14 i'm going to use my staff on this one i hope he is fine with non-magical attacks eight damage did it look like he took the full damage mm-hmm sticks hurt next one probably 11 oh that's a lot 12 it's still going flurry of blows ki point two more hits first one hits barely but hits with a 13 mm-hmm 11 damage no sorry six plus four ten i was looking at my wrong thing hits and one more time please die six i do that thing where i try to water current its bloody guts away from me so i'm not inhaling it d&d beyond yeah i'm good what nein i swim down i mean it feels like this stuff is always at the bottom or at the end can i-- because i've got shit when it comes to range-- cheat the distance and see if i can peek in from the top of the tower down while they do this okay 18 while you guys sink i went and peeked through one of those windows and looked down i do too go ahead you might roll higher than i did i look at yasha what do you think light or no okay i go-- over to caleb and yasha and i look in as he sends them in but they're backing away from the light how far up are yasha and i from the floor yeah we'll drop down and join jester and co thanks friend i knew it weeks of sleep merry christmas merry christmas
